-
In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2022-02,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings
("TDRs")
and Vintage Disclos ures.
This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty.
Additionally, this ASU requires that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables within the scope of
Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC")
326-20,
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses-Measured at Amortized Cost .
This ASU is effective for the Company on October 1, 2023.
While the adoption of this ASU is expected to result in enhanced disclosures, the Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 9 2.
EARNINGS PER SHARE Shares acquired by the ESOP are not included in basic average shares outstanding until the shares are committed for allocation or vested to an employee's individual account.
Unvested shares awarded pursuant to the Company's restricted stock benefit plans are treated as participating securities in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method as they contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends.
The two-class method is an earnings allocation that determines EPS for each class of common stock and participating security. For the Three Months Ended December 31,

In general, as market yields rise, the fair value of securities will decrease; as market yields fall, the fair value of securities will increase.
Management did not record an ACL on securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2022 because scheduled coupon payments have been made, management anticipates that the entire principal balance will be collected as scheduled, and neither does the Company intend to sell the securities, nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of the remaining amortized cost amount, which could be at maturity.
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of AFS debt securities as of December 31, 2022, by contractual maturity, are shown below.  Actual principal repayments may differ from contractual maturities due to prepayment or early call privileges by the issuer.
In the case of MBS, borrowers on the underlying loans generally have the right to prepay their loans without penalty.
For this reason, MBS are not included in the maturity categories.

-
Originating and purchasing one- to four-family loans is the Bank's primary lending business.
The Bank also originates consumer loans primarily secured by one- to four-family residential properties and originates and participates in commercial loans.
The Bank has a loan concentration in one- to four-family loans and geographic concentrations of these loans in Kansas, Missouri, and Texas.
One- to four-family loans
- Full documentation to support an applicant's credit and income, and sufficient funds to cover all applicable fees and reserves at closing, are required on all loans.
Properties securing one- to four-family loans are appraised by either staff appraisers or fee appraisers, both of which are independent of the loan origination function. The underwriting standards for loans purchased from correspondent lenders are generally similar to the Bank's internal underwriting standards.
The underwriting of loans purchased from correspondent lenders on a loan-by-loan basis is performed by the Bank's underwriters. The Bank also originates owner-occupied construction-to-permanent loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate.
Construction draw requests and the supporting documentation are reviewed and approved by designated personnel.
The Bank also performs regular documented inspections of the construction project to ensure the funds are being used for the intended purpose and the project is being completed according to the plans and specifications provided. Commercial loans
- The Bank's commercial real estate and commercial construction loans are originated by the Bank or in participation with a lead bank.
When underwriting a commercial real estate or commercial construction loan, several factors are considered, such as the income producing potential of the property, cash equity provided by the borrower, the financial strength of the borrower, managerial expertise of the borrower or tenant, feasibility studies, lending experience with the borrower and the marketability of the property.
For commercial real estate and commercial construction participation loans, the Bank performs the
13 same underwriting procedures as if the loan was being originated by the Bank.
At the time of origination, loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios on commercial real estate loans generally do not exceed
85 % of the appraised value of the property securing the loans and the minimum debt service coverage ratio is generally
1.15 .
For commercial construction loans, LTV ratios generally do not exceed
80 % of the projected appraised value of the property securing the loans and the minimum debt service coverage ratio is generally
1.15 , but it applies to the projected cash flows, and the borrower must have successful experience with the construction and operation of properties similar to the subject property.
Appraisals on properties securing these loans are performed by independent state certified fee appraisers.
The Bank's commercial and industrial loans are generally made in the Bank's market areas and are underwritten on the basis of the borrower's ability to service the debt from income.
Working capital loans are primarily collateralized by short-term assets whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by long-term assets.
In general, commercial and industrial loans involve more credit risk than commercial real estate loans due to the type of collateral securing commercial and industrial loans.
As a result of these additional complexities, variables and risks, commercial and industrial loans require more thorough underwriting and servicing than other types of loans. Consumer loans -
The Bank offers a variety of consumer loans, the majority of which are home equity loans and lines of credit for which the Bank also has the first mortgage or the home equity line of credit is in the first lien position. The underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of an applicant's payment history on other debts and an assessment of an applicant's ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan.
Although creditworthiness of an applicant is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security in relation to the proposed loan amount. Credit Quality Indicators
-
Based on the Bank's lending emphasis and underwriting standards, management has segmented the loan portfolio into three segments: (1) one- to four-family; (2) consumer; and (3) commercial.
These segments are further divided into classes for purposes of providing disaggregated credit quality information about the loan portfolio.
The classes are:
one- to four-family - originated, one- to four-family - correspondent purchased, one- to four-family - bulk purchased, consumer - home equity, consumer - other, commercial - commercial real estate, and commercial - commercial and industrial.
One- to four-family construction loans are included in the originated class and commercial construction loans are included in the commercial real estate class.
As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company's loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to loan classification and delinquency status. Loan Classification
- In accordance with the Bank's asset classification policy, management regularly reviews the problem loans in the Bank's portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification.
Loan classifications are defined as follows: • Special mention - These loans are performing loans on which known information about the collateral pledged or the possible credit problems of the borrower(s) have caused management to have doubts as to the ability of the borrower(s) to comply with present loan repayment terms and which may result in the future inclusion of such loans in the nonaccrual loan categories. • Substandard - A loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.
Substandard loans include those characterized by the distinct possibility the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. • Doubtful - Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts and conditions and values highly questionable and improbable. • Loss - Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets on the books is not warranted. 14 The following tables set forth, as of the dates indicated, the amortized cost of loans by class of financing receivable, year of origination or most recent credit decision, and loan classification.
All revolving lines of credit are presented separately, regardless of origination year.
Loans classified as doubtful or loss are individually evaluated for loss.
At December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, there were
no
loans classified as doubtful, and all loans classified as loss were fully charged-off.

The key assumptions utilized in estimating the Company's ACL at December 31, 2022 are discussed below. • Economic Forecast
- Management considered several economic forecasts provided by a third party and selected an economic forecast that was the most appropriate considering the facts and circumstances at December 31, 2022.
The forecasted economic indices applied to the model at December 31, 2022 were the national unemployment rate, changes in commercial real estate price index, changes in home values, and changes in the U.S. gross domestic product.
The economic index most impactful to all loan pools within the model at December 31, 2022 was the national unemployment rate.
The forecasted national unemployment rate in the economic scenario selected by management at December 31, 2022 had the national unemployment rate gradually increasing to
4.2 % by December 31, 2023 which was the end of our four quarter forecast time period. • Forecast and reversion to mean time periods
- The forecasted time period and the reversion to mean time period were each four quarters for all of the economic indices at December 31, 2022.
• Prepayment and curtailment assumptions
- The assumptions used at December 31, 2022 were generally based on actual historical prepayment and curtailment speeds for each respective loan pool in the model.
During the current quarter, there was a slowdown in portfolio prepayment speeds which reduced the projected prepayment speeds used in the model for generally all loan categories. • Qualitative factors
- The qualitative factors applied by management at December 31, 2022 included the following:
◦ The economic uncertainties related to the unemployment rate, the labor force composition, and the labor participation rate that are not captured in the economic forecasts; and ◦ Other management considerations related to commercial real estate loans that were not captured via the model assumptions, such as the balance and trending of large dollar commercial real estate loans. Reserve for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures
-
The following is a summary of the changes in reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures during the periods indicated.
At December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Bank's off-balance sheet credit exposures totaled $ 1.07
billion and $ 992.6
million, respectively.

BORROWED FUNDS FHLB Borrowings and Interest Rate Swaps
- At December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Bank had entered into interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $ 365.0
million in order to hedge the variable cash flows associated with $ 365.0
million of adjustable-rate FHLB advances.
At December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the interest rate swap agreements had an average remaining term to maturity of
2.8
years and
3.1
years, respectively.
The interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and involved the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Bank making fixed-rate payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreements.
At both December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the interest rate swaps were in a gain position with a total fair value of $ 12.5
million which was reported in
other assets
on the consolidated balance sheet.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, $ 734
thousand was reclassified from AOCI as a decrease to interest expense.
During the three months ended December 31, 2021, $ 1.8
million was reclassified from AOCI as an increase to interest expense.
At December 31, 2022, the Company estimated that $ 9.6
million of interest expense associated with the interest rate swaps would be reclassified from AOCI as a decrease to interest expense on FHLB borrowings during the next 12 months.
The Bank has minimum collateral posting thresholds with its derivative counterparties and posts collateral on a daily basis.
The Bank held cash collateral of $ 12.6
million and $ 12.1
million at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.
During the current quarter, the Bank utilized a leverage strategy (the "leverage strategy") to increase earnings.
The leverage strategy involved borrowing up to $ 2.60
billion either on the Bank's line of credit with FHLB or by entering into short-term FHLB advances, depending on the rates offered by FHLB, with all of the balance being paid down at quarter end, or earlier if the strategy is not profitable.
The proceeds of the borrowings, net of the required FHLB stock holdings, were deposited at the FRB of Kansas City. 22 6.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Measurements
- The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures in accordance with
ASC
820 and ASC 825.
The Company's AFS securities and interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair value other financial instruments on a non-recurring basis, such as OREO and loans individually evaluated for impairment.
These non-recurring fair value adjustments involve the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual financial instruments.
The Company groups its financial instruments at fair value in three levels based on the markets in which the financial instruments are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value.
These levels are: • Level 1 - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. • Level 2 - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. • Level 3 - Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market.
These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company's own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument.
Valuation techniques include the use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.
The results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the financial instrument. The Company bases the fair value of its financial instruments on the price that would be received from the sale of an instrument in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.
The Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. AFS Securities
- The Company's AFS securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value.
The majority of the securities within the AFS portfolio were issued by GSEs.
The Company primarily uses prices obtained from third party pricing services to determine the fair value of its securities.
On a quarterly basis, management corroborates a sample of prices obtained from the third party pricing service for Level 2 securities by comparing them to an independent source.
If the price provided by the independent source varies by more than a predetermined percentage from the price received from the third party pricing service, then the variance is researched by management.
The Company did not have to adjust prices obtained from the third party pricing service when determining the fair value of its securities during the three months ended December 31, 2022 or during fiscal year 2022.
The Company's major security types, based on the nature and risks of the securities, are: • GSE Debentures - Estimated fair values are based on a discounted cash flow method.
Cash flows are determined by taking any embedded options into consideration and are discounted using current market yields for similar securities. (Level 2) • MBS - Estimated fair values are based on a discounted cash flow method.
Cash flows are determined based on prepayment projections of the underlying mortgages and are discounted using current market yields for benchmark securities. (Level 2) • Corporate Bonds and Municipal Bonds - Estimated fair values are based on a discounted cash flow method.
Cash flows are determined by taking any embedded options into consideration and are discounted using current market yields for securities with similar credit profiles. (Level 2) Interest Rate Swaps
- The Company's interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and are reported at fair value in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet if in a gain position, and in other liabilities if in a loss position, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as adjustments to AOCI in stockholders' equity.
See "Note 5. Borrowed Funds" for additional information.
The estimated fair values of the interest rates swaps are obtained from the counterparty and are determined by a discounted cash flow analysis using observable market-based inputs.
On a quarterly basis, management corroborates the estimated fair values by internally calculating the estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis with independent observable market-based inputs from a third party.
No adjustments were made to the estimated fair values obtained from the counterparty during the three months ended December 31, 2022 or during fiscal year 2022.
(Level 2) 23 The following tables provide the level of valuation assumption used to determine the carrying value of the Company's financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the dates presented.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the determination of the fair value of assets classified as Level 3 have an inherent measurement uncertainty that, if changed, could result in higher or lower fair value measurements of these assets as of the reporting date . Loans Receivable
- Collateral dependent assets are assets evaluated on an individual basis.
Those collateral dependent assets that are evaluated on an individual basis are considered financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
The fair value of collateral dependent loans/loans individually evaluated for loss on a non-recurring basis during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 that were still held in the portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 4.1
million and $ 3.3
million, respectively.
Fair values of collateral dependent loans/loans individually evaluated for loss cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the loan and, as such, are classified as Level 3.
The one- to four-family loans included in this amount were individually evaluated to determine if the carrying value of the loan was in excess of the fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs of
10 %.
Fair values were estimated through current appraisals.
Management does not adjust or apply a discount to the appraised value of one- to four-family loans, except for the estimated sales cost noted above, and the primary unobservable input for these loans was the appraisal.
For commercial loans, if the most recent appraisal or book value of the collateral does not reflect current market conditions due to the passage of time and/or other factors, management will adjust the existing appraised or book value based on knowledge of local market conditions, recent transactions, and estimated selling costs, if applicable.
Adjustments to appraised or book values are generally based on assumptions not observable in the marketplace.
The primary significant unobservable inputs for commercial loans individually evaluated during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were downward adjustments to the book value
24 of the collateral for lack of marketability.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the adjustments ranged from
8 % to
100 %, with a weighted average of
21 %.
During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the adjustments ranged from
9 % to
56 %, with a weighted average of
21 %.
The basis utilized in calculating the weighted averages for these adjustments was the original unadjusted value of each collateral item.
OREO
- OREO primarily represents real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure and is carried at lower of cost or fair value.
The fair value for OREO is estimated through current appraisals or listing prices, less estimated selling costs of
10 %.
Management does not adjust or apply a discount to the appraised value or listing price, except for the estimated sales costs noted above.
The primary significant unobservable input for OREO was the appraisal or listing price.
Fair values of foreclosed property cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale of the property and, as such, are classified as Level 3.
The fair value of OREO measured on a non-recurring basis during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that was still held in the portfolio as of December 31, 2022 was $ 93
thousand.
There was
no
OREO measured on a non-recurring basis during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The carrying value of the properties equaled the fair value of the properties at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Fair Value Disclosures

The following discussion and analysis is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and capital resources of the Company.
The Bank comprises almost all of the consolidated assets and liabilities of the Company and the Company is dependent primarily upon the performance of the Bank for the results of its operations.
Because of this relationship, references to management actions, strategies and results of actions apply to both the Bank and the Company except where the context indicates otherwise.
This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis included in the Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, filed with the SEC. Executive Summary
The following summary should be read in conjunction with the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in its entirety. The Company recognized net income of $16.2 million, or $0.12 per share, for the current quarter compared to net income of $22.2 million, or $0.16 per share, for the prior year quarter.
The decrease in net income was due primarily to recording a provision for credit losses of $3.7 million for the current quarter compared to a $3.4 million release of provision for the prior year quarter, partially offset by lower income tax expense.
The net interest margin decreased 38 basis points, from 1.99% for the prior year quarter to 1.61% for the current quarter.
Excluding the effects of the leverage strategy, the net interest margin decreased 11 basis points, from 1.99% for the prior year quarter to 1.88% for the current quarter.
The decrease in the net interest margin excluding the effects of the leverage strategy was due mainly to an increase in the cost of borrowings and deposits, partially offset by an increase in loan yields due to higher market interest rates and a shift in the mix of interest-earning assets towards higher-yielding loans. Total assets were $9.93 billion at December 31, 2022, a $304.9 million increase from September 30, 2022.
The increase in assets was primarily a result of loan growth, primarily in the correspondent one- to four-family and commercial loan portfolios.
Total deposits were $6.07 billion at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $120.3 million from September 30, 2022.
The decrease was mainly in money market accounts as depositors likely moved funds to higher yielding investment products outside of the Bank and/or used funds to support spending.
As a result of loan growth and a decrease in deposit balances during the current quarter, FHLB borrowings increased $513.0 million, to $2.65 billion at December 31, 2022.
Stockholders' equity was $1.05 billion at December 31, 2022, a $41.7 million decrease from September 30, 2022.
The decrease was due primarily to the payment of dividends and repurchase of shares during the current quarter. The rapid increase in short-term rates led by the FRB and the impact of higher long-term rates compared to September 30, 2022 has led to decreases in the Bank's net interest margin.
There has been a runoff in deposit balances and management has increased certificate of deposit and money market account rates to stem the outflow.
The higher loan rates have made homes less affordable and reduced the turnover of housing inventory, which lowers the likelihood of existing one- to four-family loans at lower rates being paid off with the proceeds being used to fund higher rate loans.
These dynamics have caused our balance sheet to change faster than what would occur in more stable rate environments.
Net interest margin compression is anticipated to continue, and the margin may compress more in the near term, due to the shape of the yield curve and the pace at which liabilities are repricing compared to assets, along with lower costing deposits being replaced with higher costing borrowings in order to fund loan growth.
Loan growth is occurring at market interest rates that are higher than the overall loan portfolio rate; however, the shift to higher-costing borrowings and the pace at which the interest rate increase is occurring for liabilities is more than offsetting the benefit of the higher loan rates.
Management continues to evaluate funding options and plans to continue using shorter term advances, as necessary, with the anticipation that when rates begin to decrease, those borrowings can be repriced more quickly to lower cost alternatives.
The Bank's asset quality remained strong, reflected in low delinquency and charge-off ratios.
At December 31, 2022, loans 30 to 89 days delinquent were 0.10% of total loans receivable, net, and loans 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure were 0.10% of total loans receivable, net.
During the current quarter, net charge-offs ("NCOs") were $2 thousand. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had a one-year gap position of $(1.02) billion, or (10.3)% of total assets, meaning the amount of interest-bearing liabilities exceeds the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing during the same period.
This was compared to $(1.14) billion, or (11.9%) of total assets at September 30, 2022.
The change in the one-year gap amount was primarily a result of a decrease in the amount of liability cash flows coming due in one year at December 31, 2022 compared to September 30, 2022.
28 Management is in the process of implementing a new core processing system ("digital transformation") for the Bank, which is expected to be operational by September 2023.
We expect the new platform will allow us to introduce new products and services quickly to drive better efficiencies and provide a more personalized experience for our customers.
Our customers will experience a more modern internet banking experience, including both desktop and mobile.
Internet banking will deliver real-time alerts and provide our customers the ability to manage their own debit cards.
Our customers will also have multiple options for real-time payments, which positions the Bank for faster payment channels in the future.
Management anticipates information technology and related expenses will increase in fiscal year 2023 in conjunction with the digital transformation.

Critical Accounting Estimates Our most critical accounting estimates are the methodologies used to determine the ACL and reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures and fair value measurements.
These estimates are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, involve a high degree of complexity, and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments that may require assumptions about highly uncertain matters.
The use of different judgments, assumptions, and estimates could affect reported results materially.
These critical accounting estimates and their application are reviewed at least annually by our audit committee.
For a full discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see "Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates" in the Company's Annual Report on

The one- to four-family correspondent loan portfolio increased $151.4 million, or 6.9%, primarily as a result of purchasing loans that were in the pipeline as of September 30, 2022, while new applications received have tapered off.
Also, during the current quarter we experienced a reduction in prepayment speeds on the one- to four-family loan portfolio.
The commercial loan portfolio increased $143.9 million, or 14.9%, during the current quarter, as funding for construction loans continued and new commercial real estate loans were added.
Total liabilities increased $346.6 million due to new borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in deposits.
The decrease in deposit balances was due primarily to a reduction in money market account balances, which decreased $125.3 million during the current quarter as depositors likely moved funds to alternative, higher yielding investment products and/or used balances accumulated over the past several years to support spending.
The increase in loan balances and the decrease in deposit balances made it necessary to enter into new FHLB borrowings totaling $520.0 million during the current quarter.
The new FHLB borrowings were comprised of $450.0
29 million of new advances with a weighted average maturity of 3.3 years and $70.0 million on the FHLB line of credit.
The overall loan growth during the quarter exceeded management's expectations as of September 30, 2022.
While it is still management's expectation that we will stay under $10 billion in total assets at September 30, 2023, it is likely that we will exceed that threshold at several quarter-ends this year.
We are working to limit the growth in assets and to limit additional use of FHLB advances for operating needs.
Loans Receivable.
The following table presents the balance and weighted average rate of our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated.
The loan portfolio rate increased 14 basis points from September 30, 2022 to December 31, 2022, due primarily to one- to four-family correspondent and commercial loan growth, disbursements on higher rate commercial construction loans, and repricing of existing commercial loans to higher market interest rates.
The average prepayment speed on one- to four-family loans was 5% during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to 7% during the quarter ended September 30, 2022.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Bank originated $219.3 million of commercial loans and entered into commercial loan participations totaling $135.8 million.
The Bank also processed commercial loan disbursements, excluding lines of credit, of approximately $207.8 million at a weighted average rate of 5.05%.
As of December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Bank's commercial and industrial gross loan amounts (unpaid principal plus undisbursed amounts) totaled $113.2 million, $100.4 million and $99.8 million, respectively, and commitments totaled $5.1 million, $458 thousand and $6.4 million respectively.
The following table presents the Bank's commercial real estate and commercial construction loans by type of primary collateral as of the dates indicated.
As of December 31, 2022, the Bank had 18 commercial real estate and commercial construction loan commitments totaling $71.5 million, at a weighted average rate of 5.91%.
Because the commitments to pay out undisbursed funds are not cancellable by the Bank, unless the loan is in default, we generally anticipate fully funding the related projects.
Of the total commercial undisbursed amounts and commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2022, management anticipates approximately $110 million will be funded during the March 2023 quarter, $65 million during the June 2023 quarter, $82 million during the September 2023 quarter, and $74 million during the December 2023 quarter.

The distribution of our ACL and the ratio of ACL to loans receivable, by loan type, at the dates indicated is summarized below.
The ACL increased during the current quarter due primarily to growth in the commercial loan portfolio and a slowdown in portfolio prepayment speeds, which reduced the projected prepayment speeds used in the model for generally all loan categories.
The increase in the commercial real estate ACL to loans receivable ratio during the current quarter was due mainly to the slow down of prepayment speeds used in the model and the classification of two loans as special mention.

The ratio of ACL to nonaccrual loans was higher at the end of the current quarter compared to the end of the prior year quarter due mainly to a lower balance of nonaccrual loans compared to the prior year period, along with higher ACL at December 31, 2022.

Total liabilities were $8.87 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to $8.53 billion at September 30, 2022.
The increase was due to new borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in deposits. Deposits.
The following table presents the amount, weighted average rate and percent of total for the components of our deposit portfolio at the dates presented.
Deposits decreased $120.3 million during the current quarter.
The decrease was mainly in the money market portfolio.
The balance of the retail certificate of deposit portfolio remained relatively unchanged during the current quarter; however, the mix within the portfolio changed slightly.
There was growth in the medium-term category, generally with terms 18 to 35 months, while the short-term and long-term categories decreased.
The rate on the deposit portfolio increased 31 basis points during the current quarter due primarily to retail certificates of deposit repricing to higher offered rates as balances renewed, as well as an increase in rates offered on money market accounts.

Total borrowings at December 31, 2022 were $2.65 billion, an increase of $513.0 million from September 30, 2022.
The $2.65 billion was comprised of $2.14 billion in fixed-rate FHLB advances, $365.0 million in variable-rate advances tied to interest rate swaps, and $145.0 million on the FHLB line of credit.
Borrowings increased during the current quarter to fund loan growth and offset deposit outflows.
During the current quarter, the Bank utilized the leverage strategy, as discussed in the "Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022" section below.
These borrowings were repaid prior to December 31, 2022.
If the Bank continues to enter into additional FHLB borrowings during the remainder of fiscal year 2023 to fund operations, the amount of the leverage strategy transaction may continue to decrease compared to the fiscal year 2022 amount due to borrowing and collateral capacity levels. The Bank primarily uses long-term fixed-rate borrowings with no embedded options to lengthen the average life of the Bank's liabilities.
The fixed-rate characteristics of these borrowings lock-in the cost until maturity and thus decrease the amount of liabilities repricing as interest rates move higher compared to funding with lower-cost short-term borrowings.
These borrowings are laddered in order to prevent large amounts of liabilities repricing in any one period.
39 The following table presents the maturity of non-amortizing term borrowings, which consist entirely of FHLB advances, along with associated weighted average contractual and effective rates as of December 31, 2022.
In addition to the borrowings in the table below, there were two straight-line amortizing FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2022 including a $45.0 million advance at a rate of 3.50% with quarterly payments of $2.5 million through June 2027 and a $95.1 million advance at a rate of 4.45% with quarterly payments of $4.9 million through October 2027.

The following table presents borrowing activity for the periods shown.
The borrowings presented in the table have original contractual terms of one year or longer or are tied to interest rate swaps with original contractual terms of one year or longer.
The effective rate is shown as a weighted average and includes the impact of interest rate swaps and the amortization of deferred prepayment penalties resulting from FHLB advances previously prepaid.
The weighted average maturity ("WAM") is the remaining weighted average contractual term in years.
The beginning and ending WAMs represent the remaining maturity at each date presented.
For new borrowings, the WAMs presented are as of the date of issue.
The new FHLB borrowings added during the current quarter had a WAM of 3.3 years, which is generally a shorter term than what management has selected in prior periods.
The shorter terms were selected with the anticipation that when rates begin to decrease, the borrowings can be repriced more quickly to lower cost alternatives.

Stockholders' equity at December 31, 2022 was $1.05 billion, a decrease of $41.7 million from September 30, 2022.
The decrease was due primarily to the payment of $49.2 million in cash dividends and $22.2 million in share repurchases during the current quarter, partially offset by net income and the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss during the quarter. Cash dividends paid during the current quarter totaled $0.365 per share and consisted of a $0.28 per share cash true-up dividend related to fiscal year 2022 earnings and a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.085 per share.
On January 24, 2023, the Company announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.085 per share, or approximately $11.3 million, payable on February 17, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 3, 2023.
At December 31, 2022, the Company's ratio of equity to assets was 10.6%.
Excluding the impact of unrealized losses on AFS securities, this ratio would have been approximately 130 basis points higher.
In the long run, management considers the Bank's Community Bank Leverage Ratio ("CBLR") of at least 9%, which is currently the required percentage under regulatory guidelines, to be an appropriate level of capital.
At December 31, 2022, this ratio was 9.2%. During the current quarter, the Company repurchased 2,729,159 shares of common stock at an average price of $8.13 per share.
There remains $22.5 million authorized under the existing stock repurchase plan for additional purchases of the Company's common stock.
Shares may be repurchased from time to time based upon market conditions, available liquidity and other factors.
This plan has no expiration date; however, the Federal Reserve Bank's existing approval for the Company to repurchase shares expires in August 2023. At December 31, 2022, Capitol Federal Financial, Inc., at the holding company level, had $51.8 million in cash on deposit at the Bank.
For fiscal year 2023, it is the intention of the Board of Directors to continue the payout of 100% of the Company's earnings to the Company's stockholders.
Dividend payments depend upon a number of factors, including the Company's financial condition and results of operations, regulatory capital requirements, regulatory limitations on the Bank's ability to make capital distributions to the Company, and the amount of cash at the holding company level. The Company works to find multiple ways to provide stockholder value.
This has primarily been through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases.
The Company has maintained a policy of paying out 100% of its earnings to stockholders in the form of quarterly cash dividends and an annual cash true-up dividend in December of each year.
In order to provide additional stockholder value, the Company paid a True Blue Capitol cash dividend of $0.25 per share in June for six consecutive years ending in 2019.
Given the state of economic uncertainty in 2020, the Company elected to defer the True Blue dividend originally planned for June 2020.
In June 2021, the Company paid a True Blue Capitol cash dividend of $0.40 per share.
This cash dividend represented a $0.20 per share cash dividend from fiscal year 2020 and a $0.20 per share cash dividend from fiscal year 2021.
In June 2022, the Company paid a True Blue Capitol cash dividend of $0.20 per share.
The Company has paid the True Blue Capitol dividend primarily due to excess capital levels at the Company and Bank.
The Company considers various business strategies and their impact on capital and asset measures on both a current and future basis, as well as regulatory capital levels and requirements, in determining the amount, if any, and timing of the True Blue Capitol dividend.
The following table presents regular quarterly cash dividends and special cash dividends paid in calendar years 2023, 2022, and 2021.
The amounts represent cash dividends paid during each period.

(3) The average balance of investment securities includes an average balance of nontaxable securities of $1.1 million, $569 thousand, and $4.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. (4) Included in this line, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 respectively, is FHLB stock related to the leverage strategy with an average outstanding balance $84.3 million and $108.8 million, and dividend income of $1.8 million and $2.1 million at a weighted average yield of 8.49% and 7.75% and FHLB stock not related to the leverage strategy with an average outstanding balance of $113.3 million and $89.6 million and dividend income of $2.4 million and $1.7 million at a weighted average yield of 8.24% and 7.70%.
There was no FHLB stock related to the leverage strategy during the three months ended December 31, 2021. (5) The average balance of cash and cash equivalents includes an average balance of cash related to the leverage strategy of $1.79 billion and $2.31 billion during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.
There were no cash and cash equivalents related to the leverage strategy during the three months ended December 31, 2021. (6) Included in this line, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 respectively, are FHLB borrowings related to the leverage strategy with an average outstanding balance of $1.87 billion and $2.42 billion, with interest paid of $17.3 million and $13.5 million, at a weighted average rate of 3.61% and 2.19%, and FHLB borrowings not related to the leverage strategy with an average outstanding balance of $2.39 billion and $1.97 billion and interest paid of $16.3 million and $11.0 million, at a weighted average rate of 2.70% and 2.20%.
There were no FHLB borrowings related to the leverage strategy during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The FHLB advance amounts and rates included in this line item include the effect of interest rate swaps and are net of deferred prepayment penalties. (7) Net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
Net interest income depends on the average balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the interest rates earned or paid on them. (8) Net interest margin represents annualized net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.
(9) The table below provides a reconciliation between certain performance ratios presented in accordance with GAAP and the performance ratios excluding the effects of the leverage strategy, which are not presented in accordance with GAAP.
Management believes it is important for comparability purposes to provide the performance ratios without the leverage strategy because of the unique nature of the leverage strategy.
The leverage strategy reduces some of our performance ratios due to the amount of earnings associated with the transaction in comparison to the size of the transaction, while increasing our net income.

The decrease in net income was due primarily to lower net interest income in the current quarter.
The net interest margin decreased 10 basis points, from 1.71% for the prior quarter to 1.61% for the current quarter.
Excluding the effects of the leverage strategy discussed below, the net interest margin decreased 19 basis points, from 2.07% for the prior quarter to 1.88% for the current quarter.
The decrease in the net interest margin excluding the effects of the leverage strategy was due mainly to an increase in the cost of borrowings and deposits, partially offset by an increase in loan yields due to higher market interest rates.
As discussed in the "Executive Summary" above, management anticipates net interest margin compression may continue in the near term. At times, the Bank has utilized a leverage strategy to increase earnings.
During the current quarter, the average outstanding balance of leverage strategy borrowings was $1.87 billion.
The borrowings were repaid prior to quarter end.
The proceeds from the borrowings, net of the required FHLB stock holdings, which yielded 8.50% during the current quarter, were deposited at the FRB of Kansas City.
Net income attributable to the leverage strategy is largely derived from dividends received on FHLB stock holdings, plus the net interest rate spread between the yield on the cash deposited at the FRB of Kansas City and the rate paid on the related FHLB borrowings, less applicable federal insurance premiums and estimated taxes.
When the leverage strategy is in place, it reduces the net interest margin due to the amount of earnings from the transaction in comparison to the size of the transaction.
Net income attributable to the leverage strategy was $763 thousand during the current quarter, compared to $1.3 million for the prior quarter.
The decrease was due to a reduction in the size of the leverage strategy transaction because the borrowing capacity was needed for operational liquidity purposes.
Management continues to monitor the net interest rate spread and overall profitability of the strategy.
It is expected that the strategy will continue to be utilized as long as it remains profitable and/or the borrowing capacity does not need to be used for other purposes.
Interest and Dividend Income The following table presents the components of interest and dividend income for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.

The loan growth was mainly in the correspondent one-to four-family and commercial loan portfolios.
The increase in the weighted average yield was due primarily to originations and purchases at higher market yields, as well as disbursements on commercial construction loans at rates higher than the overall portfolio rate and upward repricing of existing adjustable-rate loans due to higher market interest rates.
The increase in interest income on cash and cash equivalents was due to an increase in the yield earned on balances held at the FRB of Kansas City, the majority of which were related to the leverage strategy.
The increase in dividend income on FHLB stock was due to an increase in the dividend rate paid by FHLB.
47 Interest Expense The following table presents the components of interest expense for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent.

See additional discussion in the "Financial Condition" section above.
Additionally, interest expense on borrowings increased due to an increase in the rate paid on the short-term borrowings associated with the leverage strategy, due to higher market interest rates.
The increase in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to an increase in the weighted average rate paid on certificates of deposit and money market accounts, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of those deposit types.
Provision for Credit Losses For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Bank recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.7 million, compared to a provision for credit losses of $1.1 million for the prior quarter.
The provision for credit losses in the current quarter was comprised of a $2.8 million increase in the ACL for loans and an $840 thousand increase in reserves for off-balance sheet credit exposures.
The provision for credit losses associated with both the ACL and reserves for off-balance sheet credit exposures was primarily a result of growth in the commercial loan portfolio and the balance of commercial construction off-balance sheet credit exposures, along with a slowdown in portfolio prepayment speeds, which reduced the projected prepayment speeds used in the model for generally all loan categories.

The decrease in occupancy, net was due mainly to lower utility expenses and building maintenance expenses.
The decrease in regulatory and outside services was due primarily to lower consulting expenses related to the Bank's ongoing digital transformation project as those third-party services are now directly related to the project and are included in information technology and related expenses.
The decrease in advertising and promotional expense was due mainly to the timing of campaigns and sponsorships.
The increase in office supplies and related expense was due primarily to the write-off of the Bank's remaining inventory of unissued non-contactless debit cards, which have now become obsolete.
The decrease in deposit and loan transaction costs was mainly due to loan-related activities. The Company's efficiency ratio was 54.27% for the current quarter compared to 53.52% for the prior quarter.
The change in the efficiency ratio was due primarily to lower net interest income, partially offset by lower non-interest expense.
The efficiency ratio is a measure of a financial institution's total non-interest expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income (pre-provision for credit losses) and non-interest income.
A higher value indicates that it is costing the financial institution more money to generate revenue, relative to the net interest margin and non-interest income.

The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to lower projected pretax income in the current year, as the Company's permanent differences, which generally reduce our tax rate, have a larger impact on the overall effective rate.
49 Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 The Company recognized net income of $16.2 million, or $0.12 per share, for the current quarter compared to net income of $22.2 million, or $0.16 per share, for the prior year quarter.
The decrease in net income was due primarily to recording a provision for credit losses of $3.7 million for the current quarter compared to a $3.4 million release of provision for the prior year quarter, partially offset by lower income tax expense.
The net interest margin decreased 38 basis points, from 1.99% for the prior year quarter to 1.61% for the current quarter.
Excluding the effects of the leverage strategy, the net interest margin decreased 11 basis points, from 1.99% for the prior year quarter to 1.88% for the current quarter.
The decrease in the net interest margin excluding the effects of the leverage strategy was due mainly to an increase in the cost of borrowings and deposits, partially offset by an increase in loan yields due to higher market interest rates and a shift in the mix of interest-earning assets towards higher-yielding loans.

The increase in the average balance was mainly in the correspondent one-to four-family and commercial loan portfolios.
The increase in the weighted average yield was due primarily to originations and purchases at higher market yields, as well as disbursements on commercial construction loans at rates higher than the overall portfolio rate and upward repricing of existing adjustable-rate loans due to higher market interest rates.
The increase in interest income on cash and cash equivalents and the increase in dividend income on FHLB stock were due mainly to the leverage strategy being utilized during the current quarter and not being utilized during the prior year quarter.
Additionally, market interest rates increased between periods resulting in an increase in the yield on cash due to an increase in FRB interest rates, and FHLB increased the dividend rate paid compared to the prior year quarter.

Interest expense on borrowings associated with the leverage strategy totaled $17.3 million during the current quarter.
Interest expense on FHLB borrowings not associated with the leverage strategy also increased due to new borrowings added between periods, at market interest rates higher than the overall portfolio rate, to fund operational liquidity needs.
See additional discussion in the "Financial Condition" section above.
The increase in interest expense on deposits was due to an increase in the weighted average rate paid on the deposit portfolio, primarily money market accounts and certificates of deposit, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of certificates of deposit.
50 Provision for Credit Losses The Bank recorded a provision for credit losses during the current quarter of $3.7 million, compared to a $3.4 million release of provision during the prior year quarter.
See "Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022" above for additional information regarding the provision for credit losses for the current quarter.
Non-Interest Income The following table presents the components of non-interest income for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent. For the Three Months Ended
December 31,
Change Expressed in: 2022 2021 Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) NON-INTEREST INCOME: Deposit service fees $ 3,461  $ 3,430  $ 31  0.9  % Insurance commissions 795  711  84  11.8  Other non-interest income 1,096  1,365  (269) (19.7) Total non-interest income $ 5,352  $ 5,506  $ (154) (2.8) The decrease in other non-interest income was due mainly to the prior year quarter including higher gains on a loan-related financial derivative agreement, along with a decrease in income from bank-owned life insurance. Non-Interest Expense
The following table presents the components of non-interest expense for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent. For the Three Months Ended
December 31,
Change Expressed in:   2022 2021 Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) NON-INTEREST EXPENSE: Salaries and employee benefits $ 13,698  $ 13,728  $ (30) (0.2) % Information technology and related expense 5,070  4,432  638  14.4  Occupancy, net 3,474  3,379  95  2.8  Regulatory and outside services 1,533  1,368  165  12.1  Advertising and promotional 833  1,064  (231) (21.7) Federal insurance premium 812  639  173  27.1  Office supplies and related expense 633  468  165  35.3  Deposit and loan transaction costs 611  697  (86) (12.3) Other non-interest expense 1,109  919  190  20.7  Total non-interest expense $ 27,773  $ 26,694  $ 1,079  4.0  The increase in information technology and related expenses was due mainly to higher software licensing expenses, as well as third-party project management expenses associated with the Bank's ongoing digital transformation project.
The increase in regulatory and outside services was due primarily to an increase in outside consulting services.
The decrease in advertising and promotional expense was due mainly to the timing of campaigns and sponsorships.
The increase in federal insurance premium expense was due to the leverage strategy being utilized during the current quarter and not being utilized during the prior year quarter.
The increase in office supplies and related expense was due primarily to the write-off of the Bank's remaining inventory of unissued non-contactless debit cards, which have now become obsolete.
The increase in other non-interest expense was due mainly to expenses associated with the collateral received on the Bank's interest rate swap agreements and higher deposit-related fraud losses in the current quarter.
The Company's efficiency ratio was 54.27% for the current quarter compared to 52.22% for the prior year quarter.
The change in the efficiency ratio was due primarily to higher non-interest expense in the current quarter. 51 Income Tax Expense The following table presents pretax income, income tax expense, and net income for the time periods presented, along with the change measured in dollars and percent and effective tax rate.
For the Three Months Ended
December 31,
Change Expressed in: 2022 2021 Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Income before income tax expense $ 19,747  $ 27,865  $ (8,118) (29.1) % Income tax expense 3,507  5,679  (2,172) (38.2) Net income $ 16,240  $ 22,186  $ (5,946) (26.8) Effective Tax Rate 17.8  % 20.4  % The decrease in income tax expense was due primarily to lower pretax income in the current quarter, along with a decrease in the effective tax rate.
The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to lower projected pretax income in the current year, as the Company's permanent differences, which generally reduce our tax rate, have a larger impact on the overall effective rate. Fiscal Year 2023 Projections As discussed in the "Executive Summary" section above, the rapid increase in short-term rates led by the FRB and the impact of higher long-term rates has resulted in a decrease in our net interest margin.
Net interest margin compression is anticipated to continue, and may compress more in the near term, due to the shape of the yield curve and the pace at which liabilities are repricing compared to assets and the replacement of lower cost deposits with higher costing borrowings which are being used to fund loan growth. Management anticipates information technology and related expenses will be approximately $5.5 million higher in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 due to the digital transformation.
In addition, it is expected there will be approximately $1 million more of information technology and related expenses in fiscal year 2023 related to projects outside of the digital transformation and due to general cost increases.
Overall, it is anticipated that information technology and related expenses will be approximately $6.5 million higher in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, or approximately $24.5 million for the year.
In fiscal year 2024, information technology and related expense is expected to decrease approximately $3 million from fiscal year 2023 levels due to a reduction in professional service costs.
Salaries and employee benefits are expected to be approximately $3.5 million higher in fiscal year 2023 due primarily to merit increases and salary adjustments.
Federal insurance premium expense is anticipated to be approximately $2 million higher in fiscal year 2023, due to the increase in the assessment rate beginning in January 2023.
Management anticipates the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 will be approximately 19%.
This is lower than the original projection of 20% to 21% previously provided, due mainly to lower projected pretax income as the Company's permanent differences, which generally reduce our tax rate, have a larger impact on the overall effective rate. 52 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to fund ongoing operations, to repay maturing certificates of deposit and other deposit withdrawals, to repay maturing borrowings, and to fund loan commitments.
Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of our business management.
The Company's most available liquid assets are represented by cash and cash equivalents, AFS securities, and short-term investment securities.
The Bank's primary sources of funds are deposits, FHLB borrowings, repayments and maturities of outstanding loans and MBS and other short-term investments, and funds provided by operations.
The Bank's long-term borrowings primarily have been used to manage long-term liquidity needs and the Bank's interest rate risk with the intention to improve the earnings of the Bank while maintaining capital ratios that meet or exceed the regulatory standards for well-capitalized financial institutions.
In addition, the Bank's focus on managing risk has provided additional liquidity capacity by maintaining a balance of MBS and investment securities available as collateral for borrowings. We generally intend to manage cash reserves sufficient to meet short-term liquidity needs, which are routinely forecasted for 10, 30, and 365 days.
Additionally, on a monthly basis, we perform a liquidity stress test in accordance with the Interagency Policy Statement on Funding and Liquidity Risk Management.
The liquidity stress test incorporates both short-term and long-term liquidity scenarios in order to identify and to quantify liquidity risk.
Management also monitors key liquidity statistics related to items such as wholesale funding gaps, borrowings capacity, and available unpledged collateral, as well as various liquidity ratios. In the event short-term liquidity needs exceed available cash, the Bank has access to a line of credit at FHLB and the FRB of Kansas City's discount window.
Per FHLB's lending guidelines, total FHLB borrowings cannot exceed 40% of Bank Call Report total assets without the pre-approval of FHLB senior management.
The Bank's FHLB borrowing limit was 50% of Bank Call Report total assets as of December 31, 2022, as approved by the president of FHLB.
When the leverage strategy is in place, the Bank maintains the resulting excess cash reserves from the FHLB borrowings at the FRB of Kansas City, which can be used to meet any short-term liquidity needs.
Additionally, FHLB borrowings may exceed 40% of Bank Call Report total assets as long as the Bank continues its leverage strategy and FHLB senior management continues to approve the Bank's borrowing limit being in excess of 40% of Call Report total assets.
All or a portion of the short-term FHLB borrowings in conjunction with the leverage strategy can be repaid at maturity, if necessary or desired.
The amount that can be borrowed from the FRB of Kansas City's discount window is based upon the fair value of securities pledged as collateral and certain other characteristics of those securities.
Management tests the Bank's access to the FRB of Kansas City's discount window annually with a nominal, overnight borrowing.
If management observes unusual trends in the amount and frequency of line of credit utilization and/or short-term borrowings that is not in conjunction with a planned strategy, such as the leverage strategy, the Bank will likely utilize long-term wholesale borrowing sources such as FHLB advances and/or repurchase agreements to provide long-term, fixed-rate funding.
The maturities of these long-term borrowings are generally staggered in order to mitigate the risk of a highly negative cash flow position at maturity.
The Bank's internal policy limits total borrowings to 55% of total assets.
At December 31, 2022, the Bank had total borrowings, at par, of $2.65 billion, or approximately 27% of total assets, all of which were FHLB borrowings.
Of this amount, $479.7 million were advances scheduled to mature in the next 12 months.
FHLB borrowings are secured by
certain qualifying loans pursuant to a blanket collateral agreement with FHLB.
Additionally, the Bank had pledged securities with an estimated fair value of $572.1 million as collateral for FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2022.
At December 31, 2022, the Bank had no repurchase agreements.
The Bank may enter into repurchase agreements as management deems appropriate, not to exceed 15% of total assets, and subject to the total borrowings internal policy limit of 55% as discussed above. The Bank could utilize the repayment and maturity of outstanding loans, MBS, and other investments for liquidity needs rather than reinvesting such funds into the related portfolios.
At December 31, 2022, the Bank had $817.3 million of securities that were eligible but unused as collateral for borrowing or other liquidity needs.  The Bank has access to other sources of funds for liquidity purposes, such as brokered and public unit certificates of deposit.
As of December 31, 2022, the Bank's policy allowed for combined brokered and public unit certificates of deposit up to 15% of total deposits.
At December 31, 2022, the Bank did not have any brokered certificates of deposit, and public unit certificates of deposit were approximately 2% of total deposits.
The Bank had pledged securities with an estimated fair value of $137.6 million as collateral for public unit certificates of deposit at December 31, 2022.
The securities pledged as collateral for public unit certificates of deposit are held under joint custody with FHLB and generally will be released upon deposit maturity. At December 31, 2022, $1.05 billion of the Bank's certificate of deposit portfolio was scheduled to mature within the next 12 months, including $88.1 million of public unit certificates of deposit and $22.1 million of commercial certificates of deposit.
Based on our deposit retention experience and our current pricing strategy, we anticipate the majority of the maturing retail certificates of deposit will renew or transfer to other deposit products of the Bank at prevailing rates, although no assurance can be given in this regard.  Due
53 to the nature of public unit certificates of deposit and commercial certificates of deposit, retention rates are not as predictable as for retail certificates of deposit.
While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and MBS and payments on short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, prepayments on loans and MBS, and calls of investment securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition, and are less predictable sources of funds.
To the extent possible, the Bank manages the cash flows of its loan and deposit portfolios by the rates it offers customers.
We anticipate we will continue to have sufficient funds, through the repayments and maturities of loans and securities, deposits and borrowings, to meet our current commitments.
Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") regulations impose restrictions on savings institutions with respect to their ability to make distributions of capital, which include dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account.
Under FRB and OCC safe harbor regulations, savings institutions generally may make capital distributions during any calendar year equal to earnings of the previous two calendar years and current year-to-date earnings (to the extent not previously distributed).
A savings institution that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Company, that proposes to make a capital distribution must submit written notice to the OCC and FRB 30 days prior to such distribution.
The OCC and FRB may object to the distribution during that 30-day period based on safety and soundness or other concerns.
Savings institutions that desire to make a larger capital distribution, are under special restrictions, or are not, or would not be, sufficiently capitalized following a proposed capital distribution must obtain regulatory non-objection prior to making such a distribution.
The long-term ability of the Company to pay dividends to its stockholders is based primarily upon the ability of the Bank to make capital distributions to the Company.  So long as the Bank remains well capitalized after each capital distribution (as evidenced by maintaining a CBLR greater than the required percentage, which is currently 9.0%), and operates in a safe and sound manner, it is management's belief that the OCC and FRB will continue to allow the Bank to distribute its earnings to the Company, although no assurance can be given in this regard.
Regulatory Capital
Consistent with our goal to operate a sound and profitable financial organization, we actively seek to maintain a well-capitalized status for the Bank per the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action ("PCA").
Qualifying institutions that elect to use the CBLR framework, such as the Bank and the Company, that maintain the required minimum leverage ratio of 9% will be considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the regulatory agencies' capital rules, and to have met the capital requirements for the well capitalized category under the agencies' PCA framework.
As of December 31, 2022, the Bank's CBLR was 9.2% and the Company's CBLR was 10.0%, which exceeded the minimum requirements.
54 Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk For a complete discussion of the Bank's asset and liability management policies, as well as the potential impact of interest rate changes upon the market value of the Bank's portfolios, see "Part II, Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in the Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.
The analysis presented in the tables below reflects the level of market risk at the Bank, including the cash the holding company has on deposit at the Bank. The rates of interest the Bank earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are generally established contractually for a period of time.
Fluctuations in interest rates have a significant impact not only upon our net income, but also upon the cash flows and market values of our assets and liabilities.
Our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
Risk associated with changes in interest rates on the earnings of the Bank and the market value of its financial assets and liabilities is known as interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk is our most significant market risk, and our ability to adapt to changes in interest rates is known as interest rate risk management.
The general objective of our interest rate risk management program is to determine and manage an appropriate level of interest rate risk while maximizing net interest income in a manner consistent with our policy to manage, to the extent practicable, the exposure of net interest income to changes in market interest rates.
The Board of Directors and Asset and Liability Management Committee ("ALCO") regularly review the Bank's interest rate risk exposure by forecasting the impact of hypothetical, alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity ("MVPE") at various dates.
The MVPE is defined as the net of the present value of cash flows from existing assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments.
The present values are determined based upon market conditions as of the date of the analysis, as well as in alternative interest rate environments providing potential changes in the MVPE under those alternative interest rate environments.
Net interest income is projected in the same alternative interest rate environments with both a static balance sheet and management strategies considered.
The MVPE and net interest income analyses are also conducted to estimate our sensitivity to rates for future time horizons based upon market conditions as of the date of the analysis.
In addition to the interest rate environments presented below, management also reviews the impact of non-parallel rate shock scenarios on a quarterly basis.
These scenarios consist of flattening and steepening the yield curve by changing short-term and long-term interest rates independent of each other, and simulating cash flows and determining valuations as a result of these hypothetical changes in interest rates to identify rate environments that pose the greatest risk to the Bank.
This analysis helps management quantify the Bank's exposure to changes in the shape of the yield curve. Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Gap Table.
The following gap table summarizes the anticipated maturities or repricing periods of the Bank's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities based on the information and assumptions set forth in the notes below.
Cash flow projections for mortgage-related assets are calculated based in part on prepayment assumptions at current and projected interest rates.
Prepayment projections are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and assumptions and, therefore, cannot be determined with a high degree of accuracy.
Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react differently to changes in market interest rates.
Assumptions may not reflect how actual yields and costs respond to market interest rate changes.
The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates.
Certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset.
In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table below.
A positive gap generally means more cash flows from assets are expected to reprice than cash flows from liabilities and suggests in a rising rate environment, that earnings should increase.
A negative gap generally means more cash flows from liabilities are expected to reprice than cash flows from assets and suggests, in a rising rate environment, that earnings should decrease.

Fixed-rate loans are included in the periods in which they are scheduled to be repaid, based on scheduled amortization and prepayment assumptions.
Balances are net of undisbursed amounts and deferred fees and exclude loans 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure. (2) MBS reflect projected prepayments at amortized cost.
All other securities are presented based on contractual maturities, term to call dates or pre-refunding dates as of December 31, 2022, at amortized cost. (3) Although the Bank's checking, savings, and money market accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal, management considers a substantial amount of these accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer effective maturities.
The decay rates (the assumed rates at which the balances of existing accounts decline) used on these accounts is based on assumptions developed from our actual experiences with these accounts.
If all of the Bank's checking, savings, and money market accounts had been assumed to be subject to repricing within one year, interest-bearing liabilities which were estimated to mature or reprice within one year would have exceeded interest-earning assets with comparable characteristics by $3.85 billion, for a cumulative one-year gap of (38.8)% of total assets. (4) Borrowings exclude deferred prepayment penalty costs.
Included in this line item are $365.0 million of FHLB adjustable-rate advances tied to interest rate swaps.
The repricing for these liabilities is projected to occur at the maturity date of each interest rate swap. At December 31, 2022, the Bank's gap between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities projected to reprice within one year was $(1.02) billion, or (10.3)% of total assets, compared to $(1.14) billion, or (11.9)% of total assets, at September 30, 2022.
The change in the one-year gap amount was due primarily to a decrease in the amount of liability cash flows coming due in one year at December 31, 2022 compared to September 30, 2022.
This was due primarily to a decrease in the amount of non-maturity deposits and certificates of deposit projected to mature within one year as of December 31, 2022 compared to September 30, 2022, partially offset by an increase in borrowings projected to reprice within one year as of December 31, 2022. The amount of interest-bearing liabilities expected to reprice in a given period is not typically significantly impacted by changes in interest rates, because the Bank's borrowings and certificate of deposit portfolios have contractual maturities and generally cannot be terminated early without a prepayment penalty.
If interest rates were to increase 200 basis points, as of December 31, 2022, the Bank's one-year gap is projected to be $(1.05) billion, or (10.6)% of total assets.
The change in the gap compared to when there is no change in rates is due to lower anticipated net cash flows primarily as a result of lower prepayments on mortgage-related assets in the
56 higher rate environment.
This compares to a one-year gap of $(1.17) billion, or (12.1)% of total assets, if interest rates were to have increased 200 basis points as of September 30, 2022. Change in Net Interest Income.
For each date presented in the following table, the estimated change in the Bank's net interest income is based on the indicated instantaneous, parallel and permanent change in interest rates.
The change in each interest rate environment represents the difference between estimated net interest income in the 0 basis point interest rate environment ("base case," assumes the forward market and product interest rates implied by the yield curve are realized) and the estimated net interest income in each alternative interest rate environment (assumes market and product interest rates have a parallel shift in rates across all maturities by the indicated change in rates).
Projected cash flows for each scenario are based upon varying prepayment assumptions to model likely customer behavior changes as market rates change.
Estimations of net interest income used in preparing the table below were based upon the assumptions that the total composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities does not change materially and that any repricing of assets or liabilities occurs at anticipated product and market rates for the alternative rate environments as of the dates presented.
The estimation of net interest income does not include any projected gains or losses related to the sale of loans or securities, or income derived from non-interest income sources, but does include the use of different prepayment assumptions in the alternative interest rate environments.
It is important to consider that estimated changes in net interest income are for a cumulative four-quarter period.
These do not reflect the earnings expectations of management. Change Net Interest Income At (in Basis Points) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 in Interest Rates (1) Amount ($) Change ($) Change (%) Amount ($) Change ($) Change (%) (Dollars in thousands)  -200 bp $ 160,196  $ 134  0.08  % $ 182,458  $ (775) (0.42) %  -100 bp 160,592  530  0.33  183,363  130  0.07    000 bp 160,062  —  —  183,233  —  —  +100 bp 158,931  (1,131) (0.71) 182,737  (496) (0.27) +200 bp 157,539  (2,523) (1.58) 182,081  (1,152) (0.63) +300 bp 156,129  (3,933) (2.46) 181,394  (1,839) (1.00) (1) Assumes an instantaneous, parallel, and permanent change in interest rates at all maturities. The net interest income projection was lower in the base case scenario at December 31, 2022 compared to September 30, 2022 due to higher interest expense projections on the Bank's liabilities compared to the increase in the interest income projections on the Bank's assets.
This was primarily driven by a faster increase in the cost of liabilities during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior quarter, which was caused by a decrease in the balance of the Bank's lower-costing retail deposits being replaced with higher-costing FHLB borrowings.
In addition, higher short-term interest rates over the past year have resulted in a steady increase in the rate paid on the Bank's deposit portfolio during the quarter.
This was partially offset by higher projected income on loans receivable due to a higher balance and yield on the portfolio compared to the prior quarter.
In the rising interest rate scenarios, the cost of liabilities is projected to continue to increase at a faster pace than asset yields, resulting in a projected decrease in net interest income in these interest rate scenarios.
In the decreasing interest rate scenarios at December 31, 2022, the net interest income projection remained relatively flat as the projected increase in mortgage-related assets repricing to lower interest rates was largely offset by liability cash flows repricing to lower interest rates as well. 57 Change in MVPE.
The following table sets forth the estimated change in the MVPE for each date presented based on the indicated instantaneous, parallel, and permanent change in interest rates.
The change in each interest rate environment represents the difference between the MVPE in the base case (assumes the forward market interest rates implied by the yield curve are realized) and the MVPE in each alternative interest rate environment (assumes market interest rates have a parallel shift in rates).
Projected cash flows for each scenario are based upon varying prepayment assumptions to model likely customer behavior as market rates change.
The estimations of the MVPE used in preparing the table below were based upon the assumptions that the total composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities does not change, that any repricing of assets or liabilities occurs at current product or market rates for the alternative rate environments as of the dates presented, and that different prepayment rates were used in each alternative interest rate environment.
The estimated MVPE results from the valuation of cash flows from financial assets and liabilities over the anticipated lives of each for each interest rate environment.
The table below presents the effects of the changes in interest rates on our assets and liabilities as they mature, repay, or reprice, as shown by the change in the MVPE for alternative interest rates. Change Market Value of Portfolio Equity At (in Basis Points) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 in Interest Rates (1) Amount ($) Change ($) Change (%) Amount ($) Change ($) Change (%) (Dollars in thousands)  -200 bp $ 1,436,543  $ 434,151  43.31  % $ 1,299,340  $ 404,353  45.18  %  -100 bp 1,145,824  143,432  14.31  1,024,167  129,180  14.43    000 bp 1,002,392  —  —  894,987  —  —  +100 bp 856,127  (146,265) (14.59) 759,165  (135,822) (15.18) +200 bp 713,190  (289,202) (28.85) 625,864  (269,123) (30.07) +300 bp 578,563  (423,829) (42.28) 500,730  (394,257) (44.05) (1) Assumes an instantaneous, parallel, and permanent change in interest rates at all maturities. The percentage change in the Bank's MVPE at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 was negative in all rising interest rate scenarios.
The negative impact to the Bank's MVPE, as a percentage change, was slightly lower at December 31, 2022 compared to September 30, 2022 due primarily to higher MVPE at December 31, 2022.
The increase in the MVPE was due to lower mortgage rates at December 31, 2022 which resulted in an increase in the market value on the Bank's mortgage-related assets.
In addition, the increase in short-term interest rates resulted in a decrease in the market value of the Bank's deposits compared to the prior quarter.
The MVPE ratio continues to be negatively impacted in the rising interest rate scenarios at December 31, 2022.
As interest rates increase, borrowers have less economic incentive to refinance their mortgages and agency debt issuers have less economic incentive or opportunity to exercise their call options in order to issue new debt at lower interest rates, resulting in lower projected cash flows on these assets.
As interest rates increase in the rising interest rate scenarios, repayments on mortgage-related assets are more likely to decrease and only be realized through significant changes in borrowers' lives such as divorce, death, job-related relocations, or other events as there is less economic incentive for borrowers to prepay their debt, resulting in an increase in the average life of mortgage-related assets.
Similarly, call projections for the Bank's callable agency debentures decrease as interest rates rise, which results in cash flows related to these assets moving closer to the contractual maturity dates.
The longer expected average lives of these assets increases the sensitivity of their market value to changes in interest rates.
In the decreasing interest rate scenarios at December 31, 2022, the Bank's MVPE increased due to a larger increase in the market value of the Bank's assets than the Bank's liabilities.
This is because the Bank's mortgage-related assets continue to have a longer duration in these interest rate scenarios which results in greater sensitivity in market value as interest rates change. 58 The following table presents the weighted average yields/rates and WALs (in years), after applying prepayment, call assumptions, and decay rates for our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2022.
Yields presented for interest-earning assets include the amortization of fees, costs, premiums and discounts, which are considered adjustments to the yield.
The interest rate presented for term borrowings is the effective rate, which includes the impact of interest rate swaps and the amortization of deferred prepayment penalties resulting from FHLB advances previously prepaid.
The WAL presented for term borrowings includes the effect of interest rate swaps.
