Heyu Biological Technology Corporation
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 – THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
Heyu Biological Technology Corporation (the “Company”)
was incorporated in the state of Nevada on May 18, 1987, as Asphalt Associates, Inc. and changed its name to Pacific WebWorks in January
1999. From 1999 to 2016 the Company engaged in the development and distribution of web tools software, electronic business storefront
hosting, and Internet payment systems for individuals and small to mid-sized businesses. On February 23, 2016, the Company filed a voluntary
petition for bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Utah, and soon afterwards ceased its business activities. On
August 19, 2016, the Company proposed a plan of liquidation and on November 28, 2016, the court entered an order confirming the plan of
liquidation and establishing a liquidating trust. On December 28, 2016, all assets and liabilities of the Company were transferred to
the liquidating trust.
On April 18, 2018, the Company entered into a
share purchase agreement with Mr. Ban Siong Ang and Mr. Dan Masters (the “Share Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which Mr.
Ang acquired
1,021,051,700
shares, representing
98.91 % of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (“Common
Stock”), from Mr. Masters for an aggregate purchase price of $ 335,000
(the “Share Purchase”). As a result of the Share
Purchase, Dan Masters resigned from his positions as the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Chairman
of the Board of the Company. Such resignations took place in connection with the closing of the Share Purchase and was not the result
of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies, or practices. Additionally, all
debt due to Mr. Masters from the Company was cancelled as of the closing of the Share Purchase and recognized as contributed capital.
On April 18, 2018, to fill the vacancies created
by Mr. Masters’ resignation, Ban Siong Ang and Hung Seng Tan were elected as the directors of the Company. Mr. Ang was appointed
as President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of the Company. Mr. Tan was appointed as the Executive Director of the
Company. Ms. Wendy Li was appointed as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. On February 28, 2021, Ms. Wendy Li resigned from her
position with the Company as the Chief Financial Officer. To fill the vacancies created by Ms. Wendy Wei Li’s resignation, Mr. Ang
was appointed as the Chief Financial Officer. On November 30, 2021, Mr. Bo Lyu has been appointed as the Chief Financial Officer.
On July 3, 2018, the Company changed its name
to Heyu Biological Technology Corporation and applied for a new ticker symbol “HYBT”.
During 2018, the Company established the following
subsidiaries: (1) HP Technology Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company incorporated on September 20, 2018, and (2) Heyu Healthcare
Technology Limited, a Hong Kong company incorporated on March 29, 2018. On November 5, 2018, the Company acquired the following subsidiary:
Jiashierle (Xiamen) Healthcare Technology Co., Ltd. (“JSEL”), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the
People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) on November 16, 2017.
On January 17, 2019, JSEL entered into a share
transfer agreement (the “Share Transfer Agreement”) with Mr. Yu Xu (“Mr. Xu”), an individual with an address at
No. 68 Chengde South Road, Qingpu District, Huaian City, Jiangsu Province, the PRC. Mr. Xu owned
90 % of the equity interests of Shanghai
Kangzi Medical Technology Co., Ltd., a limited liability company organized under the laws of the PRC (“Kangzi”). JSEL received
60 % of the outstanding equity interest of Kangzi from Mr. Xu for the purpose of developing a joint venture in selling medical equipment.
It was Mr. Xu and JSEL’s intention that JSEL would fund the operations of Kangzi in proportion to JSEL’s equity interest in
Kangzi. At the time of the share transfer, Kangzi owned no assets and conducted no business operation.
Since the beginning of 2019, Mr. Xu has led the
core research and development team of Kangzi to develop and manufacture a new medical product, the Submillimeter Wave (Terahertz) Quantized
Space Therapy Chamber (the “Chamber”). Utilizing submillimeter waves, the Chamber is a medical equipment designed to treat
cancer through cold nuclear fusion caused by cosmic ray muons in an enclosed chamber. We believe that exposure to an appropriate amount
of submillimeter waves would accelerate the generation of a large number of cosmic ray muons inside the human body and that such cosmic
ray muons could further facilitate cold nuclear fusion, which could reverse the cancer by converting selenium into nickel inside cells.
5
Our team consists of researchers who have years
of extensive experience in medicine and physics. The lead scientist of the team, Mr. Xu, had extensive professional experience in the
aforementioned fields and has served as the deputy chief engineer of the New Energy Base of the National Defense-Science and Technology
Commission in 1995, the chairman and chief scientist of Shanghai Guangzhui New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. from 2011 to 2019, and the
director of Shanghai Hengbian New Energy Research Institute from 2003 to 2008. In 2012, Mr. Xu received the “Harmony-Person of the
Year in China” award at the “2011 Harmony China Annual Summit” in Beijing. He was recognized as “Leaping China:
One of the Most Influential People of the Year in 2011” by China International Economic and Technical Cooperation Promotion Association,
China Elite Culture Promotion Association, and China Outstanding Chinese Merchants Association. Mr. Xu also received the “2013 China
Economic Outstanding Contribution Award” from the Organizing Committee of Boau Forum on Asian SME Development.
Pursuant to the terms of the share transfer agreement
entered into by JSEL and Kangzi on January 17, 2019, JSEL has the right to monitor and manage all aspects of operation of Kangzi, including
its research and development activities relating to the Chamber. As the development of the Chamber enters its final stage, JSEL started
accepting pre-orders for the Chamber in September 2019.
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, commonly
referred to as “COVID-19”, first found in mainland China, then in Asia and eventually throughout the world, has significantly
affected business and manufacturing activities within China, including travel restrictions, widespread mandatory quarantines, and suspension
of business activities within China. These measures have caused substantial disruptions to our business operations. We suspended our business
operation in early February 2020 due to government mandates. We partially recovered our business operation on February 17, 2020, and on
March 1, 2020, most of our staff members returned to the office and we fully resumed our business operations on the same day. Accordingly,
our business, results of operations and financial condition were adversely affected. As of the date of this Report, Chinese industries
have gradually resumed businesses as government officials started to ease the restrictive measures since April 2020. However, as most
of our top management team is an overseas team, due to the international travel ban, we still operate under remote-working conditions,
so the business of the Company is still recovering. Our management believes that our revenues will gradually improve as the epidemic and
the travel ban are lifted.
On March 17, 2020, we entered into a business
service cooperation agreement with Xiamen Qingda Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cross-strait Tsinghua
Research Institute, pursuant to which we agreed to jointly improve the plant based disinfectant spray for treating skin infections and
disinfecting wounds. The term of such agreement is three years, and can be renewed upon mutual agreement of both parties. The original
plant based disinfectant spray was developed and owned by the Company, while the improved product shall be owned by both the Company and
the Cross-strait Tsinghua Research Institute. The Cross-strait Tsinghua Research Institute will receive
2 % of gross proceeds from the
sales of such improved product.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The consolidated
financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions
and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
The condensed consolidated financial statements
of the Company as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(including normal recurring adjustments) that have been made are necessary to fairly present the financial position of the Company as
of September 30, 2022, the results of its operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, and its cash flows for the
nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for a full fiscal year. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 has been derived from the Company’s audited
financial statements included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.
6
The statements and related notes have been prepared pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Accordingly, certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and other information included in
the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates used in preparing the financial statements are reasonable and prudent;
however, actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment
assessments of goodwill, valuation of deferred tax assets, rebilling collections and certain accrued liabilities such as contingent liabilities.
As of September 30, 2022, the Company considered the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on its significant judgments and estimates.
Given the impact and other unforeseen effects on the global economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, these estimates required increased judgment,
and actual results could differ from these estimates.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments
purchased with a maturity period of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents. The carrying amounts reported in the accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair value. All of the Company’s
cash that is held in bank accounts in the PRC and Hong Kong is not protected by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)
insurance or any other similar insurance in the PRC, or Hong Kong.
Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful
accounts
Accounts receivable are stated at the historical
carrying amount net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects its best
estimate of amounts that potentially will not be collected. The Company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts taking into consideration
various factors, including but not limited to historical collection experience and credit-worthiness of the debtors, as well as the age
of the individual receivables balance. Additionally, the Company makes specific bad debt provisions based on any specific knowledge the
Company has acquired that might indicate that an account is uncollectible. The facts and circumstances of each account may require the
Company to use substantial judgment in assessing its collectability.
Inventories
Inventories consist of finished goods, work in
process, and raw materials. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. The Company applies the weighted average cost
method to its inventory.
7
Leases
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update
No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), as amended, which supersedes the lease accounting guidance under Topic 840, and
generally requires lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use (ROU) assets on the balance
sheet and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements.
Operating leases are included in operating lease
right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases
are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
ROU assets represent the Company’s right
to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising
from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments
over the lease term. As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use the industry incremental borrowing rate based on the
information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable.
The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The lease terms may include options
to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Adoption of the standard resulted in the initial
recognition of $ 215,298
of ROU assets and $ 215,298
of lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet related to office space lease
commitment on September 1, 2019.
Foreign Currency
For fiscal year 2021, the Company’s principal
country of operations is the PRC. The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in US$. The functional currency of
the Company is US$, and the functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries is RMB. The consolidated financial statements are
translated into US$ from RMB at year-end exchange rates as to assets and liabilities and average exchange rates as to revenues and expenses.

General and administrative costs
General and administrative expenses include personnel
expenses for executive, finance, and internal support personnel. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees for bad
debt costs, professional legal and accounting services, insurance, office space, banking and merchant fees, and other overhead-related
costs.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant
to ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Income taxes are provided on an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of
income taxes. Any tax paid by subsidiaries during the year is recorded. Current tax is based on the profit or loss from ordinary activities
adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowable for income tax purpose and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. ASC Topic 740 also requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for the
expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carry-forwards. ASC Topic 740 additionally requires the establishment
of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. Realization of deferred tax assets, including
those related to the U.S. net operating loss carry-forwards, are dependent upon future earnings, if any, of which the timing and amount
are uncertain.
The Company adopted ASC Topic 740-10-05, Income
Tax, which provides guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. It prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position
must meet for any of the benefits of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. It also provides accounting
guidance on derecognizing, classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions.
The Company’s policy on classification of
all interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax positions, if any, is to present them as a component of income tax expense.
Capital Structure
The Company had
2,000,000,000
shares of common
stock authorized, par value $ 0.001
per share, with
1,032,466,000
shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2022, and December
31, 2021.
Earnings (loss) per share
Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock
attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average
shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average shares of common
stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants, options, or convertible debt using the treasury stock method or the if-converted
method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders
when their effect is dilutive.
9
Potential dilutive securities are excluded from
the calculation of diluted EPS in loss periods as their effect would be antidilutive.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no
potentially dilutive shares.

NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN
During the nine months ended September 30, 2022,
the Company was unable to generate cash flows sufficient to support its operations despite Kangzi’s business operation and was dependent
on related party advances from the current controlling shareholder. In addition, the Company had experienced recurring net losses, and
had an accumulated deficit of $ 19,765,497
and working capital deficit of $ 1,812,845
as of September 30, 2022. These factors raise doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
There can be no assurance that sufficient funds
required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from any future operations or that funds will be available from external
sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. If the Company is unable to raise capital from external sources
when required, there will be a material adverse effect on its business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required
funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company’s
existing stockholders. Management is now seeking an operating company with which to merge or acquire. In the foreseeable future, the Company
will rely on related parties, such as its controlling shareholder, to provide advances to funds general corporate purposes and any potential
acquisitions of profitable investments. There is no assurance, however, that the Company will achieve its objectives or goals.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations relates to the operations and financial condition reported in our consolidated financial statements,
which appear elsewhere in this Report, and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and related notes included in
this Report. Except for the historical information contained herein, the following discussion, as well as other information in this Report,
contain “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the “safe harbor” created by those sections. Actual
results and the timing of the events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to many factors,
including those discussed in the “Forward-Looking Statements” set forth elsewhere in this Report.
Overview
Heyu Biological Technology Corporation (the “Company”
or “we”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on May 18, 1987, as Asphalt Associates, Inc. and changed its name to Pacific
WebWorks in January 1999. From 1999 to 2016, the Company engaged in the development and distribution of web tools software, electronic
business storefront hosting, and Internet payment systems for individuals and small to mid-sized businesses.
On July 3, 2018, the Company changed its name
to Heyu Biological Technology Corporation and applied for a new ticker symbol HYBT.
On January 17, 2019, Jiashierle (Xiamen) Healthcare
Technology Co., Ltd. (“JSEL”), a limited liability company organized under the laws of the People’s Republic of China
(the “PRC”), and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Share Transfer Agreement (the “Share
Transfer Agreement”) with Mr. Yu Xu (“Mr. Xu”), an individual who owned 90% of the equity interests of Shanghai Kangzi
Medical Technology Co., Ltd., a limited liability company organized under the laws of the PRC (“Kangzi”). Pursuant to the
Share Transfer Agreement, Mr. Xu transferred 60% of the equity interests of Kangzi to JSEL on January 17, 2019 for the purpose of developing
a joint venture in the business of selling medical equipment. In return, JSEL would fund the operations of Kangzi in proportion to its
equity interest in Kangzi. Kangzi owned no assets and conducts no business operation of its own. As a result, as of January 17, 2019,
Kangzi became an indirect subsidiary of the Company.
Since the beginning of 2019, Mr. Xu has led the
core research and development team of Kangzi to develop and manufacture a new medical product, the Submillimeter Wave (Terahertz) Quantized
Space Therapy Chamber (the “Chamber”). Utilizing submillimeter waves, the Chamber is a medical equipment designed to treat
cancer through cold nuclear fusion caused by cosmic ray muons in an enclosed chamber. Specifically, we believe that exposure to an appropriate
amount of submillimeter waves could accelerate the generation of a large number of cosmic ray muons inside the human body and that such
cosmic ray muons could further facilitate cold nuclear fusion, which could reverse the process of cancer by converting selenium into nickel
inside cells.
14
The core research and development team consists
of researchers who have extensive experience in medicine and physics. The lead scientist of the team, Mr. Xu, served as the deputy chief
engineer of the New Energy Base of the National Defense-Science and Technology Commission in 1995, the director of Shanghai Hengbian New
Energy Research Institute from 2003 to 2008, and the chairman and chief scientist of Shanghai Guangzhui New Energy Technology Co., Ltd.
from 2011 to 2019. In 2012, Mr. Xu was awarded the “Harmony Person of the Year in China” at the “2011 Harmony China
Annual Summit” in Beijing. He was also jointly recognized as “Leaping China: One of the Most Influential People of the Year
in 2011” by China International Economic and Technical Cooperation Promotion Association, China Elite Culture Promotion Association,
and China Outstanding Chinese Merchants Association. In 2013, the Organizing Committee of Boau Forum on Asian Small and Medium Enterprise
Development awarded Mr. Xu “2013 China Economic Outstanding Contribution Award.”
Pursuant to the terms of the Share Transfer Agreement,
JSEL has the right to monitor and manage all aspects of operation of Kangzi, including its research and development activities relating
to the Chamber. As the development of the Chamber enters its final stage at Kangzi, JSEL started accepting pre-orders for the Chamber
in September 2019. On October 15, 2019, JSEL entered into a clinical cooperation agreement (the “Clinical Cooperation Agreement”)
with Shenzhen Saikun Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (“Saikun”). Pursuant to the Clinical Cooperation Agreement, Saikun agreed to
pay JSEL RMB5.5 million as the total pre-order payment. RMB1.5 million and RMB1.5 million were delivered to JSEL on September 7 and September
27, 2019, respectively. The parties are currently working on the timing for payment of the remaining RMB2.5 million due under the Clinical
Cooperation Agreement. In exchange, JSEL is obligated to purchase all the components of a Chamber from Kangzi, fully assemble it, and
conduct a clinical trial with Saikun, third-party hospital partners, and patients using the Chamber. Specifically, after receiving the
full amount of payment from Saikun, JSEL shall transport the Chamber to Saikun’s preferred location, properly install it, and conduct
a clinical trial that lasts at least one month. During the clinical trial, JSEL shall provide training sessions regarding the proper operation
of the Chamber to Saikun’s employees. Both Saikun and JSEL are obligated to find third-party hospitals that will agree to act as
partners to co-host the clinical trial and patients who will voluntarily undergo treatment provided by the Chamber. While Saikun is responsible
for various expenses related to the clinical trial, JSEL is responsible for communicating with patients receiving treatment and other
patient-related administrative matters. When JSEL determines that Saikun is capable of properly operating the Chamber and managing activities
related to the Chamber, Saikun may request JSEL to move the Chamber to a location designated by Saikun and reinstall it. Furthermore,
upon the successful completion of the clinical trial, JSEL shall provide Saikun governmental permits necessary for the operation of the
Chamber, and Saikun shall operate the Chamber and provide related services to patients under the supervision of JSEL. In addition, JSEL
shall transfer the right of using the Chamber and any beneficiary right affiliated with using the Chamber to Saikun upon receiving the
full amount of payment from Saikun. JSEL, nevertheless, owns all the intellectual property rights affiliated with the Chamber. If the
two parties decide to terminate the Clinical Cooperation Agreement prior to the expiration of its term, Saikun’s right of using
the Chamber during the term is still effective as long as its use of the Chamber does not infringe any of JSEL’s intellectual property
rights affiliated with the Chamber. The two parties agreed that the term of the Clinical Cooperation Agreement would not end until Kangzi
successfully obtains permits issued by relevant government entities supervising development and sale of medical equipment.
To prepare for mass production of the Chambers,
Kangzi is conducting clinical experiments to make further improvements on the Chamber and adjusting features of the mass-production mold
for the Chambers. As its long-term business strategy, Kangzi focuses on researching, developing, and manufacturing high-technology medical
equipment while targeting both individual and institutional customers. It plans to mass-produce the Chambers in small and medium sizes,
establish operation centers to sell the Chambers in various cities across China, and initiate advertising and marketing campaigns on
different media platforms. Kangzi will also monetize on services provided to customers who use the Chambers and other medical products.
As of the date of this Report, we are still in the clinical experiment phase and Kangzi is still in the process of obtaining official
governmental permits from relevant government authorities to produce and sell the Chambers on a national scale. There is no assurance
that we will obtain the official governmental permits.
15
In addition to business activities related to the Chamber, the Company
is also conducting research, development, manufacturing, and sale of healthcare equipment and plant-based disinfectant spray for treating
skin infections and disinfecting wounds. On March 17, 2020, we entered into a business service cooperation agreement with Xiamen Qingda
Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cross-strait Tsinghua Research Institute, pursuant to which the parties
agreed to jointly improve a plant-based disinfectant spray for treating skin infections and disinfecting wounds. The term of such agreement
is three years, and the agreement can be renewed upon mutual agreement of both parties. The original plant-based disinfectant spray was
developed and owned by the Company, while the improved product shall be owned by both the Company and Cross-strait Tsinghua Research Institute.
The Cross-strait Tsinghua Research Institute will receive 2% of the gross proceeds from sales of such improved product. In the near future,
the Company aims to standardize the production and sale of healthcare equipment and plant-based disinfectant spray, while increasing its
brand awareness in the healthcare markets.
Since the first quarter of 2020, there has been
a worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Government regulations and shifting social behaviors have limited or closed non-essential
transportation, government functions, business activities and person-to-person interactions. In some cases, the relaxation of such trends
has been followed by actual or contemplated returns to stringent restrictions on gatherings or commerce, including in parts of the U.S.,
and the rest of the world. Global trade conditions and consumer trends that originated during the pandemic continue to persist and
may also have long-lasting adverse impact on us and our industries independently of the progress of the pandemic. We cannot predict the
duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions
to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and attempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure
requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of September 30, 2022, we had assets of $28,759, which consisted
of current assets of $2,054 in cash, $23,667 in other receivables, and $3,038 as advances to suppliers. We had liabilities of $1,841,604,
which consisted of current liabilities of $15,728 in accounts payable, $327,422 in accrued expenses and other payables, $421,953 in advances
from customers, $136 in taxes payable, and $1,076,365 in related party payables. We had an accumulated deficit of $19,765,497.
As of December 31, 2021, we had assets of $37,377,
which mainly consisted of $4,323 in cash and cash equivalents, $29,608 in other receivables, and $3,446 in operating lease right-of-use.
As of December 31, 2021, we had liabilities of $1,903,401, which mainly consisted of $17,356 in accounts payable, $471,788 in advances
from customers, $17 in other taxes payables, $1,072,293 in related party payables, and $58,073 in operating lease liabilities. We also
had an accumulated deficit of $19,621,121.
In light of the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak,
if we are required to operate in a challenging economic environment in China, or incur unanticipated capital expenditures, or decide to
accelerate growth, we may need additional financing. As of September 30, 2022, we had borrowed a total of $1,076,365 from our stockholders
for working capital purposes. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing and payable on demand.   We cannot guarantee, however,
that additional financing, if required, would be available on favorable terms, if at all. Such financing may include the use of additional
debt or the sale of the Company’s equity interests. Any financing which involves the sale of the Company’s equity interests
or instruments that are convertible into the Company’s equity interests could result in immediate and possibly significant dilution
to our existing shareholders.

Results of Operations
Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 and
2021
Our revenues during the nine months ended September
30, 2022, were $28,968, and cost of revenues was $9,623, as compared to revenues of $78,397 and cost of revenues $ 24,069 for the same
period in 2021, respectively. The decrease in our revenue were mainly due to the worsened situation of COVID-19 outbreak.
We had incurred selling expenses of $175 and administrative
expenses of $163,633 during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $1,208 and $193,905 for the same period in 2021,
respectively. The decrease in selling expenses was mainly due to fewer advertising expenses for our products in the quarter ended September
30, 2022 compared with the same period in 2021, selling expenses. The decrease in administrative expenses was mainly due to rent expenses
during the period.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements are presented on a going concern
basis. The Company’s financial condition raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
As of September 30, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $19,765,497, and a net loss of $144,376 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022. It is relying on advances from its directors, Mr. Hungseng Tan and Mr. Ban Siong Ang, to meet its limited operating
expenses.
In light of the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak,
if the economic environment in China worsens, or if we incur unanticipated capital expenditures or decide to accelerate growth, we may
need additional financing. As of September 30, 2022, we had borrowed a loan from our stockholders for working capital purposes. The loan
is unsecured, non-interest bearing and payable on demand. We cannot guarantee, however, that additional financing, if required, would
be available on favorable terms, if at all. Such financing may include the use of additional debt or the sale of the Company’s equity
interests. Any financing which involves the sale of the Company’s equity interests or instruments that are convertible into the
Company’s equity interests could result in immediate and possibly significant dilution to our existing stockholders.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues,
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ABOUT MATERIAL
RISKS
Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (§
229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a “smaller reporting company,”
as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Management has evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of
the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of a material weakness primarily related
to a lack of a sufficient number of personnel with appropriate training and experience in accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. In the future, we also intend to hire more personnel with sufficient training and experience
in U.S. GAAP.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
We believe that a control system, no matter how
well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within any company have been detected.
18
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an
adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. There are currently no legal proceedings
or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Smaller reporting companies are not required to
provide the information required by this item.
