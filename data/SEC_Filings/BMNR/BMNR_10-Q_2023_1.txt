BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT POLICIES
About Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc.
Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. f/k/a Sandy Springs
Holdings, Inc. (“ Bitmine ” or the “ Company ”) is a Delaware corporation that commenced operations
on July 16, 2020. A predecessor to the Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 16, 1995, as Interactive Lighting Showrooms,
Inc.
By a written consent dated July 16, 2021, holders
of a majority of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock approved a resolution to appoint Jonathan Bates, Raymond Mow,
Michael Maloney, and Seth Bayles to the board of directors of the Company, and to appoint Jonathan Bates as Chairman, Seth Bayles as Corporate
Secretary, Raymond Mow as Chief Financial Officer, and Ryan Ramnath as Chief Operating Officer (collectively, the “ New O&Ds ”).
Erik S. Nelson remained a director and the chief executive officer. At the same time, the shareholders approved the issuance of 32,994,999
shares of common stock in the Company’s offering of common stock at $0.015 per share, and the grant of 4,750,000 shares for services,
which were valued at $0.015 per share. As a result of the foregoing stock issuances, the New O&Ds (or entities controlled by them)
collectively acquired 24,893,877 shares of common stock, which represented approximately 62% of the issued and outstanding shares at the
time.
The appointment of certain of the New O&Ds to
the Company’s board, and issuance to the New O&Ds of a controlling interest in the Company, were made in order to enable the
Company to enter the business of creating a hosting center for Bitcoin mining computers primarily utilizing immersion cooling technology,
as well mining the Bitcoin digital currency for its own account. Prior to the change of control to the New O&Ds, the Company was a
shell company.
During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, the
Company began implementing its business plan by generating revenue from the mining of Bitcoin digital currency, hosting a third party
Bitcoin miner and the sale of mining equipment.
The Company’s year-end is August 31st.
Basis of Presentation
The foregoing unaudited interim condensed financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“ GAAP ”)
for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“ SEC ”). Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP
for complete financial statements. These unaudited interim condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements and the notes thereto included on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022. In the opinion of management, the
unaudited interim condensed financial statements furnished herein include all adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring nature,
necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim period presented.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance
with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of
the Company’s financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that the actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions
that could have a material effect on the reported amounts of the Company’s financial position and results of operations.
Operating results for the three months ended November
30, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending August 31, 2023.

Reverse Stock Split
On June 25, 2020, the Board of Directors and the shareholders
of the Company approved a
1 for 40,000 reverse split , with all fractional shares rounded up to the nearest whole share, and immediately
after the completion of the reverse split, effected a 200 for 1 forward stock split. The net effect of the splits was a 1 for 200 reverse
split of the Company’s common shares. The stock splits were effective April 27, 2021. No fractional shares of common stock were
issued connection with the Reverse Split. If, as a result of the Reverse Split, a shareholder would have otherwise held a fractional share,
the shareholder received, instead of the issuance of such fractional share, one whole share of common stock.
The Company’s financial statements in this Report
for the periods ended November 30, 2022, and August 31, 2022, and all references thereto have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the
split unless specifically stated otherwise.
Management’s Representation of Interim
Financial Statements
The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements
have been prepared by the Company without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
The Company uses the same accounting policies in preparing quarterly and annual financial statements. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted as allowed by such rules and regulations, and management believes that the
disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These condensed financial statements include all of the adjustments,
which in the opinion of management are necessary to a fair presentation of financial position and results of operations. All such adjustments
are of a normal and recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The most significant estimates relate to the calculation of stock-based
compensation, useful lives and impairment of fixed assets, income taxes and contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on historical
experience, known or expected trends, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable given the quality of information
available as of the date of these financial statements. The results of these assumptions provide the basis for making estimates about
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. There have been no material changes to the Company’s accounting estimates since the Company’s financial statements
for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022.
Segment Reporting
The Company operates in one segment - the
cryptocurrency mining industry. In accordance with the “Segment Reporting” Topic of the ASC, the Company’s chief
operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews operating results to make
decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. All material Company operations qualify for
aggregation due to their similar customer base and similarities in economic characteristics, nature of products and services, and
procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes.
Revenue Recognition
On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). Results for reporting periods
beginning after January 1, 2018, are presented under ASC 606.
10
Revenues from digital currency mining
The Company
recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company
should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that
core principle:
·
Step 1: Identify
the contract with the customer;
·
Step
2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
·
Step
3: Determine the transaction price;
·
Step
4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
·
Step
5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
In order to
identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract
and identify each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606’s definition of a “distinct”
good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: The customer can benefit from the good or
service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable
of being distinct), and the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other
promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).
If a good or
service is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services is
identified that is distinct.
The transaction
price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services
to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. When determining
the transaction price, an entity must consider the effects of all of the following:
·
Variable consideration
·
Constraining estimates of variable consideration
·
The existence of a significant financing component in the contract
·
Noncash consideration
·
Consideration payable to a customer
Variable consideration
is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue
recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The transaction price
is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance
obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time as appropriate.
The Company
has entered into digital asset mining pools by executing contracts, as amended from time to time, with the mining pool operators to provide
computing power to the mining pool. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party and the Company’s enforceable right
to compensation only begins when the Company provides computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing
power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the mining pool operator receives (less digital
asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are immaterial and are recorded as a deduction from revenue), for successfully
adding a block to the blockchain. The terms of the agreement provide that neither party can dispute settlement terms after thirty-five
days following settlement. The Company’s fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed
to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm.
11
Providing computing
power to solve complex cryptographic algorithms in support of the Bitcoin blockchain (in a process known as “solving a block”)
is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. The provision of providing such computing power is the only performance obligation
in the Company’s contracts with mining pool operators. The transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration,
which the Company measures at fair value on the date received, which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception
or the time the Company has earned the award from the pools. The consideration is all variable. Because it is not probable that a significant
reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur, the consideration is constrained until the mining pool operator successfully places a block
(by being the first to solve an algorithm) and the Company receives confirmation of the consideration it will receive, at which time revenue
is recognized. There is no significant financing component in these transactions.
Fair value of
the cryptocurrency award received is determined using the market rate of the related cryptocurrency at the time of receipt.
Revenues from Hosting
The Company
provides energized space to customers who locate their equipment within the Company’s co-hosting facility. The equipment generating
the hosting revenue is owned by the customer. Currently, the Company accepts the mining proceeds daily from the mining pool into a cold
wallet address in the Company’s name. The Company sends its hosting client its portion daily, as the Company receives such proceeds.
All performance obligations are achieved simultaneously by providing the hosting environment for the customers’ operations.
Hosting revenues consist of amounts billed in U.S. dollars for electricity and other fees, and a percentage of cryptocurrency generated
by the client’s hosting activities. With regard to hosting revenues that are billed in U.S. dollars, revenues are recorded at the
time of invoicing. With regard to hosting revenues that are based on a percentage of cryptocurrency generated by the customer, revenues
are recorded based on the Company’s share of cryptocurrency received from the mining pool on the date of receipt.
During the three
months ending November 30, 2022, the Company did not generate any revenue from hosting services.
Revenues
from the sale of mining equipment
The Company
records revenue from the resale of mining equipment it has purchased. Revenue for the sale of mining equipment is recognized under the
guidelines of ASC 606. During the three months ending November 30, 2022, the Company generated $ 72,800
in revenues from the sale of mining
equipment.
Revenues
From Mining
Revenues from mining cryptocurrency for its own account
will be recorded at the spot price for the cryptocurrency on a daily basis based on the Company’s proportionate share of cryptocurrency
earned by the mining pools in which the Company participates on the date the Company receives its share from the pool. During
the three months ending November 30, 2022, the Company generated $ 28,916
in revenues from mining cryptocurrency.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid temporary
cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. On November 30, 2022, and August 31, 2022,
respectively, the Company’s cash equivalents totaled $ 180,646
and $ 392,550 , respectively.
Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrencies held are accounted for as intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment quarterly,
when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired.
Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the cryptocurrency at
the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment
to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that
an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a
quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. During
the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $ 3,523
due to a reduction in the quoted price of
cryptocurrency. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses, if the price of cryptocurrency increases, is not permitted.
12
Cryptocurrency earned by the Company through its mining
activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The sales of digital currencies
are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and any realized gains or losses from
such sales are included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The Company
accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first in first out (“FIFO”) method of accounting.
The Company
holds its cryptocurrencies in a cold storage wallet account in its name, and not with a custodian or other intermediary. The Company has
an account with Gemini Trust Company, LLC, which is a qualified custodian regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services.
Currently, the Company does not store cryptocurrencies at Gemini, and only transfers cryptocurrencies that it desires to liquidate to
its account at Gemini immediately prior to the liquidation. The Company uses Gemini’s multi-signature feature for account access.
Income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC
740,  “Accounting for Income Taxes” . Under FASB ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under FASB ASC 740, the effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. FASB ASC 740-10-05,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to
be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized
is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company
assesses the validity of its conclusions regarding uncertain tax positions quarterly to determine if facts or circumstances have arisen
that might cause it to change its judgment regarding the likelihood of a tax position’s sustainability under audit.
Stock-based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
using the fair value method following the guidance outlined in Section 718-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosure
about Stock-Based Compensation. This section requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for
an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized
over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award- the requisite service period (usually
the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service.
Net Loss per Share
Net loss per common share is computed by dividing
net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period as defined by Financial Accounting Standards, ASC Topic 260,
“Earnings per Share.” Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) calculations are determined by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share calculations
are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding.
13
Stock Purchase Warrants
The Company accounts for warrants issued to purchase
shares of its common stock as equity in accordance with FASB ASC 480,
Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and
Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.
We determine the accounting classification
of warrants we issue, as either liability or equity classified, by first assessing whether the warrants meet liability classification
in accordance with ASC 480-10, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, then
in accordance with ASC 815-40, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s
Own Stock. Under ASC 480, warrants are considered liability classified if the warrants are mandatorily redeemable, obligate us to settle
the warrants or the underlying shares by paying cash or other assets, and warrants that must or may require settlement by issuing variable
number of shares. If warrants do not meet the liability classification under ASC 480-10, we assess the requirements under ASC 815-40,
which states that contracts that require or may require the issuer to settle the contract for cash are liabilities recorded at fair value,
irrespective of the likelihood of the transaction occurring that triggers the net cash settlement feature.
If the warrants do not require liability classification
under ASC 815-40, in order to conclude equity classification, we also assess whether the warrants are indexed to our common stock and
whether the warrants are classified as equity under ASC 815-40 or other GAAP. After all such assessments, we conclude whether the warrants
are classified as liability or equity. Liability classified warrants require fair value accounting at issuance and subsequent to initial
issuance with all changes in fair value after the issuance date recorded in the statements of operations. Equity classified warrants only
require fair value accounting at issuance with no changes recognized subsequent to the issuance date. We do not have any liability classified
warrants as of any period presented.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements are typically
the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the life of the term of the lease. The estimated useful lives for all other property
and equipment are as follows:
Schedule of useful lives of assets
Life (Years)
Miners and mining equipment
2
Machinery and equipment
5
-
7
Office and computer equipment
3
No depreciation is recorded on an asset until it is
placed in service. Due to the nature of the equipment, it can only be placed in service when the hosting site is properly configured to
turn on the machines. As of November 30, 2022, and August 31, 2022, the Company had $ 4,380,789
and $ 6,509,602 , respectively, of fixed
assets not in service. During the three months ended November 30, 20222 the Company performed an analysis of the carrying cost of its
mining equipment compared to the current market price for the same equipment. As a result, the Company determined that its fixed assets
had been impaired by an amount of $ 122,950 . This amount was recorded as an “impairment of fixed assets” on its statements
of operations for the three months ended November 30, 2022
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842) , which establishes a new lease accounting model for lessees. The updated guidance requires an entity to recognize
assets and liabilities arising from financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The
amended guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early
adoption permitted. In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01,
Codification Improvements , which clarifies certain aspects of the
new lease standard. The FASB issued ASU 2018-10,
Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases
in July 2018. Also in 2018, the
FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases
(Topic 842) Targeted Improvements,
which provides an optional transition method whereby the new
lease standard is applied at the adoption date and recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings. The amendments have the same effective
date and transition requirements as the new lease standard.
14
We adopted ASC 842 on July 16, 2020. The adoption
of this guidance did not have any impact on our financial statements.
In March 2022, the SEC staff released Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 121 ("SAB 121"), which requires entities that hold crypto assets on behalf of platform users to
recognize a liability to reflect the entity’s obligation to safeguard the crypto assets held for its platform users, whether
directly or through an agent or another third party acting on its behalf, along with a corresponding safeguarding asset. Both the
liability and corresponding safeguarding asset shall be measured at fair value. SAB 121 also requires disclosure of the nature
and amount of crypto assets being safeguarded, how the fair value is determined, an entity’s accounting policy for
safeguarding liabilities and corresponding safeguarding assets, and may require disclosure of other information about risks and
uncertainties arising from the entity’s safeguarding activities. The Company is not in the business of holding its
customer’s crypto assets for safekeeping. For crypto assets that are not maintained on our platform and for which the Company
does not maintain a private key or the ability to recover a customer’s private key, these balances are not recorded, as there
is no related safeguarding obligation in accordance with SAB 121. This guidance is effective from the first interim period
after June 15, 2022 and should be applied retrospectively. We adopted SAB 121 during the three months ended August 31, 2022,
and it did not have any impact on our financial statements.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Stockholders’ Equity
The Company is authorized to issue
500,000,000
shares
of Common Stock with a par value of $ 0.0001
per share, and
20,000,000
shares of preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.0001
per share.
As of November 30, 2022, and August 31, 2022, there were
48,778,344
and
48,606,915
shares of common stock outstanding, respectively. As
of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, our board of directors had authorized the issuance of one series of preferred stock, the Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred”), for
500,000
shares, of which
453,966
had been issued.
16
Issuance of Shares
During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the
Company issued the following shares:
·
71,429
shares were issued to an officer pursuant to the terms of his employment contract, which entitle the officer to a quarterly bonus payable in shares of common stock. The shares were valued at $ 31,429 , or $0.44
per share, based on the value indicated by the Company’s recently
completed Unit Offering. The bonus shares vest on January 15, 2027 if the officer is still employed with us on that date, and are amortized from the date of issuance to January 15, 2027.
·
100,000
shares to a third party for investor relations services. The
shares were valued at $ 44,000 , or $0.44 per share, based on the value indicated by the Company’s recently completed Unit
Offering.
The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based
compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during
which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award- the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).
The Company attributes compensation to expense using the straight-line method. Since the Company’s common stock is thinly traded,
the Company utilizes the value, or an estimate thereof, paid by third parties for common stock in arms-length transactions with the Company.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of the results
of operations and financial condition of the Company for the quarters ended November 30, 2022, and 2021, should be read in conjunction
with the other sections of this Quarterly Report, including the Financial Statements and notes thereto of the Company included in this
Quarterly Report. The various sections of this discussion contain forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations
and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this Quarterly Report as well as other matters over which
we have no control. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results may differ materially.
The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after
the date of this Quarterly Report.
Overview
Since July 2021, our business has been as a blockchain
technology company that is building out industrial scale digital asset mining, equipment sales and hosting operations. The Company’s
primary business is hosting third-party equipment used in mining of digital asset coins and tokens, specifically Bitcoin, as well as self-mining
for its own account. Our state-of-the-art facilities will be specifically designed and constructed for housing advanced mining equipment.
Our data centers will provide power, racks, proprietary thermodynamic management (heat dissipation and airflow management), redundant
connectivity, 24/7 security, as well as software which provide infrastructure management and custom firmware that boost performance and
energy efficiency.
We plan to operate our data centers using immersion
cooling technology. Immersion cooling is the process of submerging computer components (or full servers) in a thermally, but not electrically,
conductive liquid (dielectric coolant) allowing higher heat transfer performance than air and many other benefits. Immersion cooling can
be up to 95% more efficient than standard air cooling, producing an estimated PUE (power usage effectiveness) of 1.05. This cooler environment
has been shown to extend machine lives by 30% or longer.
We initially decided to locate our initial
facilities in Trinidad, because it has some of the cheapest electricity in the world due to its abundant supplies of oil and gas and
because some of our technical staff is located there. We have entered into an agreement with Telecommunications Services of Trinidad
& Tobago Limited (“TSTT”), the largest and oldest telecom company in Trinidad, to co-locate up to 125 800 kw
containers for hosting digital asset miners. TSTT has up to 93 potential locations for co-location of our containers. Under the
agreement, we have the option, but not obligation, to co-locate containers at our own pace. We pay a fixed amount per container,
plus the actual electricity costs incurred by our containers in the amount billed to TSTT by the local utility without any markup.
The agreement provides that our hosting containers will be billed for electricity usage at the local utility’s standard rates,
which is the greater of 3.5 cents per kwh or 75% of the declared reserve capacity, which is equal to the customer’s highest
expected monthly kilovolt-ampere demand at $7.40. The term of the agreement expires on October 14, 2031. We have the right to
terminate our agreement with TSTT at any time that the price for electricity consumption exceeds $0.05 per kwh.
Until our permanent hosting facilities are operational,
we are temporarily leasing space for a small number of ASIC computers with a co-host. We intend to move all of our currently owned and
customer owned miners to our new TSTT hosting facilities once they are operational.
In October 2022, we completed the installation of
initial hosting containers under our agreement with TSTT. However, prior to commencing operations, TSTT advised us that the utility had
refused to honor its existing agreement with TSTT with respect to electricity supplied to our pilot hosting site, and instead indicated
that the rate would be approximately $0.09 per kwh. TSTT has informed us that it does not believe that its contract with the local utility
entitles it to vary the rate it charges for the use of electricity and has protested the decision. At this time, we are unable to predict
how this dispute between TSTT and the utility will be resolved, what form any resolution may take or how long any resolution may take.
Accordingly, we are delaying the installation of additional containers in Trinidad until this dispute is resolved. Until the dispute between
TSTT and the utility is resolved, we intend to focus our efforts on purchasing or developing hosting locations in the United States and
Canada, either directly or in joint ventures with other industry participants.
In light of the recent developments in Trinidad, we
are focusing our efforts in the near term on developing hosting locations in the United States and Canada. We are exploring situations
where medium to long-term power agreements may be available at affordable prices, whether using traditional power sources such as coal
or natural gas, as well as environmentally friendly sources such as hydroelectric, wind and solar-backed projects, which might allow us
to generate collateral revenue from the sale of excess power to the local utility grid and from the generation of saleable carbon credits.
18
We recently entered into a joint arrangement whereby
we contributed one immersion contain and six transformers, and sold four immersion containers, to a joint venture with a third party that
has procured a location and a power purchase agreement in Pecos, Texas.
Our digital asset mining operation is focused on the
generation of digital assets by solving complex cryptographic algorithms to validate transactions on specific digital asset network blockchains,
which is commonly referred to as “mining.” Mining requires the use of specialized computers equipped with application-specific
integrated circuit (ASIC) chips (known as “miners”) to solve complex cryptographic algorithms in support of the Bitcoin blockchain
(in a process known as “solving a block”) in exchange for digital asset rewards (primarily bitcoin). Whether we are hosting
our client’s computers or mining for our own account with our own computers, the miners participate in “mining pools”
organized by “mining pool operators” in which we or our clients share mining power (known as “hash rate”) with
the hash rate generated by other miners participating in the pool to earn digital asset rewards. The mining pool operator provides a service
that coordinates the computing power of the independent mining enterprises participating in the mining pool. Fees are paid to the mining
pool operator to cover the costs of maintaining the pool. The pool uses software that coordinates the pool members’ mining power,
identifies new block rewards, records how much hash rate each participant contributes to the pool, and assigns digital asset rewards earned
by the pool among its participants in proportion to the hash rate each participant contributed to the pool in connection with solving
a block.
Our digital asset self-mining activity competes with
a myriad of mining operations throughout the world to complete new blocks in the blockchain and earn the reward in the form of an established
unit of a digital asset. Revenue from digital asset mining and hosting third party digital asset miners are impacted by volatility in
bitcoin prices, as well as increases in the Bitcoin blockchain’s network hash rate resulting from the growth in the overall quantity
and quality of miners working to solve blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain and the difficulty index associated with the secure hashing algorithm
employed in solving the blocks.  Gross profits from digital asset mining are primarily impacted by the cost of electricity to operate
the miners and to a lesser extent by other operating costs. While we expect to sell or exchange a portion of the digital assets we mine
to fund our growth strategies or for general corporate purposes, we may hold our digital assets as investments in anticipation of continued
adoption of digital assets as a “store of value” and a more efficient medium of exchange than traditional fiat currencies.
As the demand for digital assets increases and digital
assets become more widely accepted, there is an increasing demand for professional-grade, scalable infrastructure to support growth of
the blockchain ecosystem. We expect to continually evaluate the performance of our data centers, including our ability to access additional
megawatts of electric power and to expand our total self-mining and customer and related party hosting hash rates.
We also generate revenues from the advantageous purchase and sale of equipment
used for digital asset mining and hosting. We have relationships with some suppliers that enable us to acquire highly desired equipment
at attractive prices, which we plan to resell to third parties. In most cases, resales of digital asset mining equipment would be to our
hosting customers, which have the dual benefit of generating short-term gross profits from the equipment sale as well as growing the customer
base of our hosting business. We have recently resold some hosting equipment in Trinidad to third parties that we determined would not
be need in the short-term due to the dispute between TSTT and the local utility described above.
The primary factors that will impact future hosting
revenues include: (i) the price of bitcoin, since hosting revenues are primarily a percentage of bitcoin mined by clients; (ii) the completion
of operational hosting facilities, as potential hosting clients have been reluctant to sign contracts prior to the date the Company has
a fully operational hosting facility; and (iii) the availability of attractive electricity prices, since power usage is the primary marginal
cost for any mining operation. Our hosting revenues will also be impacted by the resolution of the dispute between TSTT and the local
utility regarding the electricity rate that will be charged our co-location facilities in Trinidad, as well as by the timing of the resolution.
The primary factors that will impact proprietary mining
revenues include: (i) the price of bitcoin; (ii) the completion of operational facilities to provide us with a cost-effective facility
to operate in; (iii) the availability of attractive electricity prices, since power usage is the primary marginal cost for any mining
operation; and (iv) the availability of mining equipment suitable for the Company’s immersion hosting environment at attractive
prices and available capacity in the Company’s hosting facilities. Our proprietary mining activities will also be impacted by the
resolution of the dispute between TSTT and the local utility regarding the electricity rate that will be charged our co-location facilities
in Trinidad, as well as by the timing of the resolution.
19
Revenues from cryptocurrency mining, whether derived
from hosting clients or from proprietary mining, are impacted significantly by volatility in Bitcoin prices, as well as increases in the
Bitcoin blockchain’s network hash rate resulting from the growth in the overall quantity and quality of miners working to solve
blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain and the difficulty index associated with the secure hashing algorithm employed in solving the blocks.
Below are changes in key metrics effecting the profitability of mining Bitcoin during the quarter ended November 30, 2022:
As of November 30, 2022
As of August 31, 2022

The primary factors that will impact resales of mining
equipment include the availability of equipment at attractive prices and the number of participants willing to enter the mining business
or expand their existing operations, which is highly correlated to the margin from mining, as determined by the market price of bitcoin
and prevailing energy costs. Also, our resales of mining equipment will be impacted by the existence of hosting capacity with attractive
electricity rates in our hosting operations.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended November
30, 2022, and 2021.
Revenues
During the three months ended November 22, 2022, the
Company generated $101,716 in revenue, compared to $-0- revenue in the three months ended November 22, 2021.
During the three months ended November 30, 2022,
the Company generated $28,916 in Bitcoin revenue from self-mining digital assets, compared to $-0- revenue in the three months ended November
22, 2021. The Company currently owns 362 miners that it plans to use for proprietary mining, the deployment of which will occur when its
immersion hosting environment is operational. In addition, the Company is seeing good opportunities to acquire mining equipment at attractive
prices, which should create opportunities for additional revenues. Mining revenues in the three months ended November 30, 2022 were adversely
impacted by delays in opening the Company’s first hosting facility in Trinidad. The facility was completed in October 2022, but
its opening has been delayed facility pending resolution of a dispute between our co-location partner in Trinidad and the electricity
company in Trinidad over the price that will be charged for electricity provided to our hosting operations. At this time, we do not have
any information on when the dispute will be resolved and in what manner. As a consequence, we are currently focusing our efforts on the
development of hosting centers in the United States and Canada, both directly and in joint ventures with third parties. Our hosting revenue
was derived from the deployment of a minority of our miners at a temporary facility in Trinidad.
During the three months ended November 22, 2022,
the Company generated $72,800 in revenue from equipment sales, compared to $-0- revenue in the three months ended November 22, 2021. During
the three months ended November 22, 2022, the Company sold four hosting containers to a joint venture that is constructing a hosting facility
in Texas for $1,200,000. The purchase price is payable pursuant to a promissory note bearing interest at 5% per annum, and is paid by
41 equal monthly payments of $31,204 commencing December 30, 2022. Under the guidelines of ASC 606, the Company reports revenue from equipment
sales which are vendor financed by the Company under the installment sale method.
The Company also expects to generate additional revenues from the resale
of certain hosting equipment, primarily containers and transformers.
The Company did not have any revenues from hosting
during the three months ended November 22, 2022 or 2021. The lack of hosting revenues in the three months ended November 20, 2022 was
because of the Company’s decision to cease hosting third party miners, and concentrate on self-mining, during the quarter. In the
current market environment, the price of ASIC miners has fallen to the point that we believe self-mining is more profitable than hosting
third party miners. During the quarter, the Company reached an agreement to terminate its only hosting client, and repurchased the miners
which it had previously sold to the hosting client. The lack of hosting revenues in the three months ended November 20, 2021 was because
the Company had not commenced operations at that time.
20
The primary factors that will impact our revenues
in subsequent periods are described in the “ —Overview ” above.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales were $118,476 in the three months ended
November 30, 2022, compared to $-0- in the three months ended November 30, 2021, when there was no revenue.
Cost of sales related to mining was $75,395 in
the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to $-0- in the three months ended November 30, 2021, when there was no revenue from
mining. Cost of sales normally includes electricity, utilities, facilities costs, depreciation and supplies. For the three months ended
November 30, 2022, major components of cost of sales include rent to house mining and hosting equipment in temporary facilities, electricity,
and supplies. The Company believes that cost of sales related to mining as a percentage of revenues were greater in the three months ended
November 30, 2022 than what it expects to incur in future periods, as cost of sales in the most recent period were inflated by costs associated
with maintaining temporary hosting facilities while our permanent hosting facility was being completed, and costs from the completion
of our new hosting facility that we determined not to capitalize. Furthermore, our temporary hosting facilities carried electricity costs
that were materially higher than the electricity costs that we expect to incur in our permanent facilities.
Cost of sales related to sales of mining equipment
was $43,080 for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to $-0- in the three months ended November 30, 2021 when there was
no revenue from equipment sales. Cost of sales consists of the purchase price of equipment sold, plus shipping and value added tax on
the equipment.
Since we are in the early stages of setting up our
infrastructure to generate higher levels of revenues, we expect that our cost of sales to generate revenue from hosting or mining for
our own account will exceed the revenue we generate until we achieve sufficient economies of scale by deploying more miners. In future
periods, the largest component of our cost of sales from mining will consist of electricity costs.
Operating Expenses
During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the
Company incurred $491,921 in operating expenses, compared to $664,043 in operating expenses during the three months ended November 30,
2021. Major components of operating expenses for the 2022 period as compared to the 2021 period were:

(28% )
The lower level of operating expenses in the 2022
period as compared to the 2021 period is primarily attributable to reduced professional fees in 2022 as compared to 2021. Included in
operating expenses in the three months ended November 30, 2022 was $75,429 in non-cash expenses due to the issuance of common stock for
professional services and to related parties as compensation, as compared to $550,000 in the three months ended November 30, 2021. We
also incurred $122,950 in impairment expenses in the three months ended November 30, 2022 to write-down certain mining equipment to current
market prices. Additionally, we incurred $3,523 in impairment expenses on our cryptocurrency holdings due to the decline in the price
of Bitcoin we are holding. The Company expects that operating expenses will trend materially higher in future periods as the Company begins
paying regular compensation to existing officers and directors, hires additional employees, and incurs other costs associated with the
commencement of operations.
21
Other Income (Expense)
During the three months ended November 30, 2022,
the Company incurred $21,230 in other income, as compared to ($44,713) of other expense in the three months ended November 30, 2021. The
significant change in other income (expense) was mainly attributable to lower interest expense in the three months ended November 30,
2022 of ($4,808), as compared to ($44,713) in the three months ended November 30, 2021, which was due to lower outstanding loan balances
during the 2022 period. In addition, the Company recorded other income of $16,939 attributable to the termination of a hosting contract,
and interest income of $9,099 in te three months ended November 30, 2022, as compared to $-0- and $-0- in the three months ended November
30, 2021. The Company expect interest income to trend higher as it finances the sale of more equipment.
Net
(Loss)
As a result of the foregoing, during the three months
ended November 30, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of ($470,665), or ($0.01) per share, as compared to a net loss of ($708,756)
or $(0.02) per share during the three months ended November 30, 2021. The decrease in the Company’s net loss in the three months
ended November 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021, is attributable to the factors discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of November 30, 2022, the Company had $180,646
in cash on hand.
During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the
Company had a net loss of ($470,665).
Cash flows used in operating activities were ($1,182,918)
for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to cash flows used of ($69,518) for the three months ended November 30, 2021. The
substantial increase in cash flows used in operating activities for the three months ended November 30, 2022 was primarily attributable
to an increase in notes receivable of $1,197,450 from the sale of equipment, which was offset by a decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation
from $550,000 in 2021 as compared to $75,429 in 2022, an increase in impairment losses from $-0- in 2021 to $122,950 in 2022, an increase
in deferred revenues from $-0- in 2021 to $255,673 in 2022, and an increase in depreciation from $-0- in 2021 to $59,053 in 2022, as well
as minor changes in other balance sheet accounts.
Cash flows generated by investing activities were
$571,014 for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to cash flows used in investing activities of ($1,477,148) for the three
months ended November 30, 2021. Cash flows from investing activities were mainly impacted by purchases of equipment for $1,477,148 in
the three months ended November 30, 2021, as compared to sales of $1,558,443 of equipment in the three months ended November 30, 2022,
which was offset by the contribution of $987,429 of equipment to a joint venture in the three months ended November 30, 2022.
Cash flows provided by financing activities were
$400,000 for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $1,470,000 for the three
months ended November 30, 2021. The cash flows provided by financing activities in both periods were entirely provided by draws under
a line of credit with Innovative Digital Investors Emerging Technology, L.P. (“IDI”), a limited partnership controlled by
Jonathan Bates, our Chairman, and Raymond Mow, our chief financial officer, and the reduction in cash flows in 2022 was due to lower draws
in the 2022 period as compared to the 2021 period.
On October 19, 2022, the Company entered into a new
Line of Credit Agreement with IDI (the “2022 LOC Agreement”), under which the Company has the right to borrow up to $1,000,000
to finance the purchase of equipment necessary for the operation of the Company’s business, and related working capital. Loans under
the 2022 LOC Agreement accrue interest at twelve percent (12%) per annum, compounded on a 30/360 monthly basis until the loans have been
repaid in full. The Company has the right to submit draw requests under the 2022 LOC Agreement until April 15, 2023. Each draw request
is subject to the approval of IDI in its sole discretion. The amount drawn, plus all accrued interest therein, is repayable in full on
December 1, 2023. As of the date of this Report the amount borrowed under the 2022 LOC Agreement amounted to $400,000.
22
The Company believes that cash on hand, amounts
that may borrow under the 2022 LOC Agreement, and expected receipts from the sale of equipment, and revenue from self-mining will provide
it with sufficient liquidity to fund its operations for the next 12 months. The Company expects to receive approximately $41,000 monthly
from the sale of two immersion containers in August 2022, and approximately $31,000 per month from the sale of four immersion containers
to a joint venture in which the Company will be both lender to and equity investor. Currently, the Company owns 362 miners which it plans
to use for self-mining. Assuming neither the price of bitcoin nor the difficulty index changes, and based on the Company’s expected
electricity costs, the Company estimates that it could generate approximately $19,500 in monthly gross profit from the miners once they
are moved to a permanent location in Trinidad. Other sources of revenue that the Company expects to receive include equity distributions
from the ROC Digital joint venture once it becomes operational in late 2022. The Company does not budget to include any proceeds from
the exercise of its outstanding warrants because it is not able to predict when or if the market price of its common stock will exceed
the exercise price of its warrants.
Nevertheless, while the Company does not need
additional capital to maintain operations, it will need additional capital to expand its digital asset hosting and mining business, and
take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace that currently exist due to the recent decline in digital asset prices. Therefore,
the Company has engaged an investment banker and is pursuing additional capital-raising alternatives, including the potential issuance
of common stock in a private placement, or the issuance of convertible notes or preferred stock. There is no assurance that the Company
will be able to raise additional capital or that the terms of any capital raise are not dilutive to current shareholders or carry other
terms that are unfavorable to the Company and its shareholders.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of
our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, or “GAAP.” The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we
base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our significant accounting policies are fully
described in Note 1 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, and we believe those accounting policies
are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
Item 3. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk.
As a smaller reporting company, we are not required
to provide the information called for by this Item.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, with the
assistance of management, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based
on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of November 30, 2022. These controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, there were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
The Company may be involved in certain
legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. Legal expenses associated with any contingency
are expensed as incurred. The Company’s officers and directors are not aware of any threatened or pending litigation to which the
Company is a party.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. However, please
carefully consider the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item I A.
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022, which could materially affect our business, financial condition
or future results. In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K,
as updated by our subsequent filings under the Exchange Act. The occurrence of any of the risks discussed in such filings, or other events
that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial, could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
Furthermore, we add the following risk factor to the risk factors set forth in prior reports filed
with the SEC:
The digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies,
including bitcoin, trade are relatively new and largely unregulated, and thus may be exposed to fraud and failure. Such failures may result
in a reduction in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and can adversely affect an investment in us.
Digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies
trade are relatively new and, in most cases, largely unregulated. Many digital exchanges do not provide the public with significant information
regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices or regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may
lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, cryptocurrency exchanges, including prominent exchanges handling a significant
portion of the volume of digital asset trading.
For example, in the first half of 2022, each of Celsius
Network, Voyager Digital Ltd., and Three Arrows Capital declared bankruptcy, resulting in a loss of confidence in participants of the
digital asset ecosystem and negative publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly. In November 2022, FTX, the third largest digital
asset exchange by volume at the time, halted customer withdrawals and shortly thereafter, FTX and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy.
In response to these events, the digital asset markets,
including the market for bitcoin specifically, have experienced extreme price volatility and several other entities in the digital asset
industry have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected, further undermining confidence in the digital assets markets and in bitcoin.
These events have also negatively impacted the liquidity of the digital assets markets as certain entities affiliated with FTX engaged
in significant trading activity. If the liquidity of the digital assets markets continues to be negatively impacted by these events, digital
asset prices (including the price of bitcoin) may continue to experience significant volatility and confidence in the digital asset markets
may be further undermined. These events are continuing to develop and it is not possible to predict at this time all of the risks that
they may pose to us, our service providers or on the digital asset industry as a whole.
A perceived lack of stability in the digital asset
exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of digital asset exchanges due to business failure, hackers or malware, government-mandated
regulation, or fraud, may reduce confidence in digital asset networks and result in greater volatility in cryptocurrency values. These
potential consequences of a digital asset exchange’s failure could adversely affect an investment in us.
