Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( “ Quarterly Report ” ) includes statements of our expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs that constitute
“ forward-looking statements ”
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“ Exchange Act ” ), and are intended to come within the safe harbor protection provided by those sections. These forward-looking statements involve various risks and uncertainties. The statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements. Many of the forward-looking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "will," "intend," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "should," "plan," "estimate," "potential," or similar expressions. However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future - including statements expressing general views about future operating results - are forward-looking statements. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Our Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our Company ’ s actual results to differ materially from historical experience and our present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: inflationary impacts, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the outcome of legal proceedings, changes in the confectionery business environment, seasonality, consumer interest in our products, the success of our frozen yogurt business, receptiveness of our products internationally, consumer and retail trends, costs and availability of raw materials, competition, the success of our co-branding strategy, the success of international expansion efforts and the effect of government regulations. For a detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements contained herein, please see Part II,
“ Item 1A. Risk Factors ”
and the risks described elsewhere in this report and the section entitled
“ Risk Factors ”
contained in Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 filed on May 27, 2022, as amended on June 28, 2022, as updated by this report.
Unless otherwise specified, the
“ Company, ”
“ we, ”
“ us ”
or
“ our ”
refers to Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries (including its operating subsidiary with the same name, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., a Colorado corporation).

Subsequent Events
On
December 14, 2022 ( the "Effective Date"), the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release (the “Settlement Agreement”), by and among the Company, Bradley L. Radoff, an individual (“Radoff”), Andrew T. Berger, an individual (“Berger”), AB Value Partners, LP (“AB Value Partners”), AB Value Management LLC (“AB Value Management” and, together with AB Value Partners, “AB Value” and, together with Radoff, “ABV-Radoff”), and Mary Bradley, an individual (each, a “Party” and together, the “Parties”), pertaining to, among other things, the dismissal of all pending lawsuits between the Parties and the appointment of
one
director to the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”).
Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company and ABV-Radoff agreed to a “Standstill Period” commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the date that is
forty-five
( 45 ) days prior to the beginning of the Company’s advance notice period for the nomination of directors at the Company’s
2025
annual meeting of stockholders. During the Standstill Period, ABV-Radoff agreed to comply with certain customary standstill provisions, including an agreement by each member of ABV-Radoff, subject to certain exceptions, to vote their shares of common stock as recommended by the Board on any matter to be voted on at any meetings of stockholders during the Standstill Period, including with respect to the election of directors, and an agreement that at
no
time will AB Value beneficially own
10.0 % or more of the Company’s common stock outstanding at such time and at
no
time will Radoff own
12.5 % or more of the Company’s common stock outstanding at such time.
The Company also agreed that the Board shall take such action to appoint a female director candidate with at least
five
years of fast-moving consumer goods franchise operational experience and
three
years of prior public company board experience who qualifies as an independent director under Rule
5605
of the Nasdaq Listing Rules (the “Applicable Criteria”) designated by ABV-Radoff and subject to the Board’s reasonable approval (such approval
not
to be unreasonably withheld) (the “New Director”), to serve as a member of the Board with a term expiring at the
2023
annual meeting of stockholders (the
“2023
Annual Meeting”). The Company agreed to nominate such New Director for election to the Board at the
2023
Annual Meeting and the Company’s
2024
annual meeting of stockholders and to appoint the New Director to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Audit Committee of the Board, subject to the Board’s reasonable approval (such approval
not
to be unreasonably withheld) and the New Director’s qualifications to serve on such committees under the Nasdaq Listing Rules and the applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. In addition, subject to certain conditions and requirements described in the Agreement, ABV-Radoff will have certain customary replacement rights during the Standstill Period. Any replacement New Director identified by ABV-Radoff must satisfy the Applicable Criteria and be reasonably acceptable to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board and the Board (such acceptance
not
to be unreasonably withheld).
Furthermore, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Parties agreed to mutual releases and discharges of all claims by AB Value, Radoff, Bradley and Berger against the Company and by the Company against AB Value, Radoff, Bradley and Berger, in each case up to the date of the Agreement, except in connection with the claims, counterclaims, causes of action, defenses, or other rights or obligations relating to the demand for books and records pursuant to Section
220
of the Delaware General Corporation Law previously delivered by Radoff to the Company dated
November 9, 2022.
The Parties agreed to dismiss (i) the lawsuit filed by AB Value on
September 23, 2021,
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, against the Company and certain of its former and current directors captioned AB VALUE PARTNERS, LP, et al. v. Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc., et al., C.A.
No.
2021 - 0819 -LWW (Del. Ch.), and (ii) the lawsuit filed by the Company on
September 28, 2022,
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against ABV-Radoff, Berger and Mary Bradley captioned Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc. v. Radoff, et al. C.A.
No.
2021 - 0819 -LWW (Del. Ch.) (collectively, the “Lawsuits”). The Settlement Agreement includes customary mutual non-disparagement provisions during the Standstill Period. The Company agreed to reimburse ABV-Radoff for their fees and expenses in the preparation and execution of the Settlement Agreement and the related matters in the amount of
one million
and
seventy-five thousand
dollars ($ 1,075,000.00 ).
On
December 16, 2022,
the Parties filed a Stipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice for each of the Lawsuits with the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware.
Management evaluated all activity of the Company through the issue date of the financial statements and concluded that
no
subsequent events, except for those described above, have occurred that would require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Except for the recent accounting pronouncements described below, other recent accounting pronouncements are
not
expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
In
June 2016,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
2016 - 13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic
326 ): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU
2016 - 13
significantly changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. ASU
2016 - 13
will require immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets, which will generally result in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses on loans and other financial instruments and affect the carrying value of accounts receivable. ASU
2016 - 13
is effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning
March 1, 2023,
and subsequent interim periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU
2016 - 13
will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

–REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS
The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with its customers in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification® (“ASC”)
606,
which provides that revenues are recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received for those goods or services. The Company generally receives a fee associated with the Franchise Agreement or License Agreement (collectively “Customer Contracts”) at the time that the Customer Contract is entered. These Customer Contracts have a term of up to
20
years, however the majority of Customer Contracts have a term of
10
years. During the term of the Customer Contract, the Company is obligated to many performance obligations that the Company has determined are
not
distinct. The resulting treatment of revenue from Customer Contracts is that the revenue is recognized proportionately over the life of the Customer Contract.
Initial Franchise Fees, License Fees, Transfer Fees, and Renewal Fees
The initial franchise services are
not
distinct from the continuing rights or services offered during the term of the franchise agreement and are treated as a single performance obligation. Initial franchise fees are being recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation over the term of the franchise agreement, which is generally
10
years.

Gift Cards
The Company’s franchisees sell gift cards, which do
not
have expiration dates or non-usage fees. The proceeds from the sale of gift cards by the franchisees are accumulated by the Company and paid out to the franchisees upon customer redemption. ASC
606
requires the use of the “proportionate” method for recognizing breakage. Under the guidance of ASC
606,
the Company recognizes breakage from gift cards when the gift card is redeemed by the customer or the Company determines the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (“gift card breakage”). The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based on Company-specific historical redemption patterns.

– STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Warrants
In consideration of an Exclusive Supplier Operating Agreement, dated
December 20, 2019 ( “Exclusive Supplier Agreement”), by and between the Company and Edible Arrangements, and the performance of specific obligations therein, on
December 20, 2019,
the Company issued a Common Stock Purchase Warrant, dated
December 20, 2019 ( the “Warrant”), to purchase up to
960,677
shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Warrant Shares”) at an exercise price of $ 8.76
per share. The Warrant Shares vest in annual tranches in varying amounts following each contract year under the exclusive supplier agreement, subject to, and only upon, the achievement of certain revenue thresholds on an annual or cumulative
five -year basis in connection with performance under the exclusive supplier agreement. The Warrant expires
six
months after the final and conclusive determination of revenue thresholds for the
fifth
contract year and the cumulative revenue determination in accordance with the terms of the Warrant. As of
November 30, 2022,
no
warrants have vested and subsequent to the termination by the Company of the Exclusive Supplier Agreement on
November 1, 2022,
the Company has
no
remaining material obligations under the Warrant.
The Company determined that the grant date fair value of the warrants was de minimis and did
not
record any amount in consideration of the warrants. The Company utilized a Monte Carlo model to determine the grant date fair value.
Stock-Based Compensation
Under the Company’s
2007

Table of Contents
During the
nine
months ended
November 30, 2022,
the Company issued
36,144
stock options and issued up to
94,892
performance-based restricted stock units subject to vesting based on the achievement of performance goals. These issuances were made to the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as a part of the incentive compensation structure for Mr. Sarlls and Mr. Arroyo. The stock options were issued with an aggregate grant date fair value of $ 77,267
or $ 2.14
per share. The performance-based restricted stock units were issued with an aggregate grant date fair value of $ 298,582
or $ 6.29
per share, based upon a target issuance of
47,446
shares. The stock options granted vest with respect to
one - third
of the shares on the last day of the Company’s current fiscal year ending
February 28, 2023,
and vest as to remaining shares in equal quarterly increments on the last day of each quarter until the final vesting on
February 28, 2025.
The performance-based restricted stock units will vest following the end of the Company’s fiscal year ending
February 2025
with respect to the target number of performance-based restricted stock units if the Company achieves an annualized total shareholder return of
12.5%
during the performance period, subject to continued service through the end of the performance period. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine the number of performance-based restricted stock units between
0 - 200%
of the target number that will vest based on the achievement of performance below or above the target performance goal.
The Company recognized $ 190,893
and $ 471,530
of stock-based compensation expense during the
three - and
nine -month periods ended
November 30, 2022,
respectively, compared to $ 621,997
and $ 845,011
during the
three
and
nine
month periods ended
November 30, 2021,
respectively. Compensation costs related to stock-based compensation are generally amortized over the vesting period of the stock awards.
Except as noted above, restricted stock units generally vest in equal annual installments over a period of
five
to
six
years. During the
nine -month periods ended
November 30, 2022,
and
2021,
52,421
and
117,470
restricted stock units vested and were issued as common stock, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation expense of non-vested, non-forfeited restricted stock units and stock options granted as of
November 30, 2022,
was $ 665,709 , which is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average period of
2.05
years.
NOTE

– EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through the settlement of restricted stock units. Restricted stock units become dilutive within the period granted and remain dilutive until the units vest and are issued as common stock.
The weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted earnings per share does
not
include outstanding common shares issuable if their effect would be anti-dilutive. During the
nine
months ended
November 30, 2022,
130,367
shares of issuable common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. During the
nine
months ended
November 30, 2021,
960,677
shares of common stock warrants and
160,951
shares of issuable common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
NOTE

– LEASING ARRANGEMENTS
The Company conducts its retail operations in facilities leased under non-cancelable operating leases of up to
ten
years. Certain leases contain renewal options for between
five
and
ten
additional years at increased monthly rentals. Some of the leases provide for contingent rentals based on sales in excess of predetermined base levels.
The Company acts as the primary lessee of some franchised store premises, which the Company then subleases to franchisees, but the majority of existing franchised locations are leased by the franchisee directly.
In some instances, the Company has leased space for its Company-owned locations that are now occupied by franchisees. When the Company-owned location was sold or transferred, the store was subleased to the franchisee who is responsible for the monthly rent and other obligations under the lease.
The Company also leases trucking equipment and warehouse space in support of its manufacturing operations. The expense associated with trucking and warehouse leases is included in the cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company accounts for payments related to lease liabilities on a straight-line basis over the lease term. During the
nine
months ended
November 30, 2022,
and
2021,
lease expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $ 636,202
and $ 582,344 , respectively.
The lease liability reflects the present value of the Company’s estimated future minimum lease payments over the life of its leases. This includes known escalations and renewal option periods reasonably assured of being exercised. Typically, renewal options are considered reasonably assured of being exercised if the sales performance of the location remains strong. Therefore, the Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability include an assumption on renewal options that have
not
yet been exercised by the Company and are
not
currently a future obligation. The Company has separated non-lease components from lease components in the recognition of the Asset and Liability except in instances where such costs were
not
practical to separate. To the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the Asset and Liability, the impact is immaterial. For franchised locations, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance, and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-store related leases such as storage facilities and trucking equipment. For leases where the implicit rate is
not
readily determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease liability that represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease. The weighted average discount rate used for operating leases was
3.4 % as of
November 30, 2022.

– COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Contested Solicitation of Proxies
During the
three
and
nine
months ended
November 30, 2022,
the Company incurred substantial costs associated with a stockholder’s contested solicitation of proxies in connection with our
2022
annual meeting of stockholders. During the
three
and
nine
months ended
November 30, 2022,
the Company incurred approximately $ 764,000
and $ 2.9
million, respectively, of costs associated with the contested solicitation of proxies, compared with $ 800,000
and $ 1.7
million, respectively, of costs associated with a contested solicitation of proxies incurred in the
three
and
nine
months ended
November 30, 2021.
These costs are recognized as a general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company will realize material increased costs during the
three
months ending
February 28, 2023 ( the Company’s
fourth
quarter) associated with final expenses from the
2022
contested solicitation of proxies and the
December 14, 2023
Settlement Agreement, as described above under “Subsequent Events.”
Employment Agreement Payments upon a Change in Control
We have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executives which contain, among other things, "change in control" severance provisions.
The employment agreement of Mr. Dudley generally provides that, if the Company or the executive terminates the executive's employment under circumstances constituting a "triggering termination," the executive will be entitled to receive, among other benefits,
2.99
times the sum of (i) the executive's annual salary using the highest annual base compensation rate in effect at any time during employment and (ii) the greater of (a)
two
times the bonus that would be payable to the executive for the bonus period in which the change in control occurred or (b)
25%
of the amount described in clause (i). The employment agreement of Mr. Dudley also provided for a payment of $ 18,000 , which represents the estimated cost to the executive of obtaining accident, health, dental, disability, and life insurance coverage for the
18 -month period following the expiration of COBRA coverage.
A “change in control,” as used in the agreement for Mr. Dudley, generally means a change in the control of the Company following any number of events, but specifically, a proxy contest in which our Board of Directors prior to the transaction constitutes less than a majority of our Board of Directors after the transaction or the members of our Board of Directors during any consecutive
two -year period who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board of Directors cease to be the majority of the Board of Directors at the conclusion of that period. We have determined that a change in control has taken place on
October 6, 2021.
A “triggering termination” generally occurs when an executive is terminated during a specified period preceding a change in control of us, or if the executive or the Company terminates the executive’s employment under circumstances constituting a triggering termination during a specified period after a change in control. A triggering termination
may
also include a voluntary termination under certain scenarios.

In connection with Mr. Dudley’s retirement, Mr. Dudley and the Company entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release (the “Separation Agreement”), dated
September 30, 2022 ( the “Effective Date”). Under the Separation Agreement, Mr. Dudley retired from the Company on the Effective Date and will be entitled, subject to the terms and conditions therein, to the following payments and separation benefits: (i) a cash separation payment amount in accordance with Mr. Dudley’s employment agreement; (ii) acceleration of vesting of Mr. Dudley’s
12,499
unvested restricted stock units as of the Effective Date; (iii) an additional cash severance payment of
$70,000;
and (iv) Mr. Dudley has agreed to provide consulting services to the Company through
December 31, 2022,
to the extent requested by the Company, for which he will receive a cash payment of $ 56,250 . In addition, the Separation Agreement includes covenants related to cooperation, solicitation, and employment, as well as the customary release of claims and non-disparagement provisions in favor of the Company.
As a result of this Separation Agreement the Company incurred the following costs during the
nine
months ended
November 30, 2022:
Accrued severance compensation:
$ 928,938
Accelerated restricted stock unit compensation expense:
95,156
Consulting Services:
37,500
Total
$ 1,061,594
Mr. Sarlls’ employment agreement provides for the following upon “change in control”: If Mr. Sarlls’ employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or if he resigns for good reason on or within
2
years following consummation of a change in control, the cash severance amount ( 15
months of base salary) which would otherwise be payable on the regular payroll schedule over a
15 -month period following separation (if severance were due outside the change in control context) will be accelerated and paid in a lump sum promptly following separation. Mr. Sarlls’ agreement incorporates by reference the change in control definition set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A - 3 (i)( 5 ).
Mr. Arroyo’s employment agreement provides for the following upon “change in control”: If Mr. Arroyo’s employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or if he resigns for good reason on or within
2
years following consummation of a change in control, the cash severance amount ( 9
months of base salary) which would otherwise be payable on the regular payroll schedule over a
9 -month period following separation (if severance were due outside the change in control context) will be accelerated and paid in a lump sum promptly following separation. Mr. Arroyo’s agreement incorporates by reference the change in control definition set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A - 3 (i)( 5 ).
Purchase Contracts
The Company frequently enters into purchase contracts of between
six
to
eighteen
months for chocolate and certain nuts. These contracts permit the Company to purchase the specified commodity at a fixed price on an as-needed basis during the term of the contract. Because prices for these products
may
fluctuate, the Company
may
benefit if prices rise during the terms of these contracts, but it
may
be required to pay above-market prices if prices fall and it is unable to renegotiate the terms of the contract. As of
November 30, 2022,
the Company was contracted for approximately $ 36,000
of raw materials under such agreements. The Company has designated these contracts as normal under the normal purchase and sale exception under the accounting standards for derivatives. These contracts are
not
entered into for speculative purposes.

The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on operating contribution, which excludes unallocated
corporate general and administrative costs and income tax expenses or benefits. The Company’s reportable segments are strategic businesses that utilize common merchandising, distribution, and marketing functions, as well as common information systems and corporate administration. All inter-segment sales prices are market-based. Each segment is managed separately because of the differences in required infrastructure and the difference in products and services:

NOTE

– INCOME TAXES
The Company provides for income taxes pursuant to the liability method. The liability method requires recognition of deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations. These differences will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events
may
occur and whether recovery of an asset, including the utilization of a net operating loss or other carryforward prior to its expiration, is more likely than
not.
18
ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO INTERIM (UNAUDITED) CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Table of Contents
Realization of the Company's deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company generating sufficient taxable income, in the appropriate tax jurisdictions, in future years, to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed. A valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is established when it is more likely than
not
that we will
not
realize some portion or all of the tax benefit of our deferred income tax assets. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, whether it is more likely than
not
that our deferred income tax assets are realizable based upon recent past financial performance, tax reporting positions, and expectations of future taxable income. The determination of deferred tax assets is subject to estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate our deferred tax assets to determine if our assumptions and estimates should change .
During the
three
and
nine
months ended
November 30, 2022,
the Company incurred a significant loss before income taxes, primarily as a result of substantial costs associated with a stockholder’s contested solicitation of proxies in connection with our
2022
annual meeting of stockholders. Management evaluated recent losses before income taxes and determined that it is
no
longer more likely than
not
that our deferred income taxes are fully realized. Because of this determination, the Company reserved for approximately $ 2.0
million of deferred tax assets. As of
November 30, 2022,
the Company has a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.

Item 2.           Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is qualified by reference and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes, and Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in the 10-K filed with the SEC on May 27, 2022, for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, as amended by Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A filed on June 28, 2022.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains certain forward-looking information. See
“ Forward-Looking Statements ”
above for certain information concerning forward-looking statements.
Overview
We are an international franchisor, confectionery manufacturer, and retail operator. Founded in 1981, we are headquartered in Durango, Colorado, and manufacture an extensive line of premium chocolate candies and other confectionery products. Our subsidiary, U-Swirl International, Inc. (“U-Swirl”), franchises and operates soft-serve frozen yogurt cafés. Our revenues and profitability are derived principally from our franchised/licensed system of retail stores that feature chocolate, frozen yogurt, and other confectionary products. We also sell our candy outside of our system of retail stores and license the use of our brand with certain consumer products. As of November 30, 2022, there was one Company-owned, 101 licensee-owned and 162 franchised Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores operating in 37 states, Panama, and the Philippines. As of November 30, 2022, U-Swirl operated three Company-owned cafés and 58 franchised cafés located in 21 states and Qatar. U-Swirl operates self-serve frozen yogurt cafés under the names “U-Swirl,” “Yogurtini,” “CherryBerry,” “Yogli Mogli Frozen Yogurt,” “Fuzzy Peach Frozen Yogurt,” “Let’s Yo!” and “Aspen Leaf Yogurt”.
Labor and Supply Chain
As a result of macroeconomic inflationary trends and disruptions to the global supply chain, we have experienced and expect to continue experiencing higher raw material, labor, and freight costs. We have begun to see labor and logistics challenges, which we believe have contributed to lower factory, retail, and e-commerce sales of our products due to the availability of material, labor, and freight. In addition, we could experience additional lost sale opportunities if our products are not available for purchase as a result of continued disruptions in our supply chain relating to an inability to obtain ingredients or packaging, labor challenges at our logistics providers or our manufacturing facility, or if we or our franchisees experience delays in stocking our products. For additional information, see “ Part I. Item 1A. - Risk Factors - The Availability and Price of Principal Ingredients Used in Our Products Are Subject to Factors Beyond Our Control ” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, as amended by Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A filed on June 28, 2022.
Contested Solicitation of Proxies
During the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022, the Company incurred substantial costs associated with a stockholder’s contested solicitation of proxies in connection with our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. During the three and nine months ended November 30, 2022, the Company incurred approximately $764,000 and $2.9 million, respectively, of costs associated with the contested solicitation of proxies, compared with $800,000 and $1.7 million of costs associated with a contested solicitation of proxies incurred in the three and nine months ended November 30, 2021. These costs are recognized as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Future costs associated with the stockholder’s contested solicitation of proxies, the related legal proceedings, and the settlement thereof, as described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 1 of Part I of this quarterly report under the caption “Subsequent Events” in this Form 10-Q may have a material impact on the result of future periods. Additionally, as a result of the contested solicitation of proxies in the prior year and the resulting changes to the composition of the Company’s Board of Directors, the Company incurred $934,000 of severance costs during the nine months ended November 30, 2022, resulting from the retirement of Edward L. Dudley in September 2022.
Termination of Strategic Partnership with Edible Arrangements
On November 1, 2022, the Company sent a formal notice to Edible Arrangements, LLC (“Edible Arrangements”), terminating the Exclusive Supplier Operating Agreement, dated December 20, 2019 (“Exclusive Supplier Agreement”), by and between the Company and Edible Arrangements, and the Ecommerce Licensing Agreement, dated March 16, 2020 (“Licensing Agreement”), by and between the Company and Edible Arrangements. Subsequent to the termination of the Supplier Agreement and Licensing Agreement, the Company has no remaining material obligations under the Strategic Alliance Agreement, dated as of December 20, 2019, by and among the Company, Farids & Co. LLC and Edible Arrangements; the Common Stock Purchase Warrant, dated December 20, 2019, issued to Edible Arrangements; and the Indemnification Letter Agreement, dated March 16, 2020, by and between the Company and Edible Arrangements.

Factory Sales
The increase in factory sales for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021, was primarily due to a 13.0%, $661,000, increase in sales of product to our network of franchised and licensed retail stores and a 19.1%, $248,000, increase in shipments of product to customers outside our network of franchised retail stores. The increase in sales of product to our network of franchised and licensed retail stores was primarily the result of a higher sell price and higher same-store pounds purchased. Same-store pounds purchased by domestic franchise and licensed locations increased 5.7% during the three months ended November 30, 2022, when compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021.
Retail Sales
Retail sales at Company-owned stores increased 6.7% during the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021, as a result of an increase in Company-owned same store sales. Same store sales at all Company-owned locations increased 12.9% during the three months ended November 30, 2022, when compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average number of Company-owned stores in operation resulting from the sale of a Company-owned location to a franchisee.
Royalties, Marketing Fees, and Franchise Fees
The increase in royalty and marketing fees from the three months ended November 30, 2021, to the three months ended November 30, 2022, was primarily due to an increase in same store sales at domestic Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory locations and at U-Swirl Frozen Yogurt cafés. Same-store sales at domestic franchise Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory locations increased by 3.0% and same-store sales at U-Swirl Frozen Yogurt cafés increased by 14.0% during the three months ended November 30, 2022, when compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021.
Franchise fee revenue for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021, was relatively unchanged.

Adjusted gross margin and factory adjusted gross margin are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted gross margin is equal to the sum of our factory adjusted gross margin plus our retail gross margin calculated in accordance with GAAP. Factory adjusted gross margin is equal to factory gross margin plus depreciation and amortization expense. We believe adjusted gross margin and factory adjusted gross margin are helpful in understanding our past performance as a supplement to gross margin, factory gross margin, and other performance measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe that adjusted gross margin and factory adjusted gross margin are useful to investors because they provide a measure of operating performance and our ability to generate cash that is unaffected by non-cash accounting measures. Additionally, we use adjusted gross margin and factory adjusted gross margin rather than gross margin and factory gross margin to make incremental pricing decisions. Adjusted gross margin and factory adjusted gross margin have limitations as analytical tools because they exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization expense and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for any measure reported under GAAP. Our use of capital assets makes depreciation and amortization expense a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate income. Due to these limitations, we use adjusted gross margin and factory adjusted gross margin as measures of performance only in conjunction with GAAP measures of performance such as gross margin and factory gross margin.

Table of Contents
Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
Factory gross margins increased to 22.9% in the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to 22.2% in the three months ended November 30, 2021. This increase was due primarily to an increase in prices partially offset by increased labor and material costs and expense associated with inventory obsolescence.
Retail gross margins were unchanged at 62.3% during the three months ended November 30, 2022, and 2021.
Franchise Costs
The increase in franchise costs in the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021, was due primarily to an increase in franchise convention and travel expenses in the three months ended November 30, 2022. As a percentage of total royalty and marketing fees, and franchise fee revenue, franchise costs increased to 36.5% in the three months ended November 30, 2022, from 30.7% in the three months ended November 30, 2021. This increase as a percentage of royalty, marketing and franchise fees is primarily the result of higher costs.
Sales and Marketing
The increase in sales and marketing costs for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021, was primarily due to an increase in equity compensation costs and contract labor associated with the retirement of Edward Dudley, and an increase in advertising costs.
General and Administrative
The decrease in general and administrative costs for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021, is primarily due to lower costs associated with a stockholder’s contested solicitation of proxies in connection with our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company incurred approximately $764,000 of costs associated with the contested solicitation of proxies, compared with $2.7 million of costs associated with a contested solicitation of proxies and associated severance costs during the three months ended November 30, 2021. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in legal expenses and salaries and wages in the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared with the three months ended November 30, 2021. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 22.3% in the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to 45.4% in the three months ended November 30, 2021.
Retail Operating Expenses
Retail operating expenses were relatively unchanged during the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021. Retail operating expenses, as a percentage of retail sales, decreased from 66.1% in the three months ended November 30, 2021, to 62.2% in the three months ended November 30, 2022. This decrease is primarily the result of higher retail sales.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization, exclusive of depreciation and amortization included in cost of sales, was $128,000 in the three months ended November 30, 2022, a decrease of 10.9% from $144,000 in the three months ended November 30, 2021. This decrease was the result of lower amortization of franchise rights, the result of a decrease in frozen yogurt cafés in operation. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the annual amortization of intangible assets based upon existing intangible assets and current useful lives. Depreciation and amortization included in cost of sales increased 3.1% to $160,000 in the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to $155,000 in the three months ended November 30, 2021.
Other Income
Net interest income was $3,000 in the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to net interest income of $2,200 incurred in the three months ended November 30, 2021.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
During the three months ended November 30, 2022, we did not incur any income tax benefit on a loss before income taxes of $212,000. This was the result of recording a full reserve on our deferred income tax asset. Our effective income tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2021, was 24.5%. See Note 14 to the financial statements for a description of income taxes, deferred tax assets, and associated reserves.

Factory Sales
The increase in factory sales for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2021, was primarily due to an 8.0%, $1.1 million, increase in sales of product to our network of franchised and licensed retail stores partially offset by a 15.7%, $429,000, decrease in shipments of product to customers outside our network of franchised retail stores.
Retail Sales
Retail sales at Company-owned stores increased 2.7% during the nine months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2021, primarily as a result of an increase in same-store sales at Company-owned locations. Same-store sales at all Company-owned locations increased 6.1% during the nine months ended November 30, 2022, when compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2021.
Royalties, Marketing Fees, and Franchise Fees
The slight increase in royalty and marketing fees for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2021, was primarily due to an increase in same-store sales at domestic franchise frozen yogurt cafés. Same-store sales at all domestic franchise locations increased 3.8% during the nine months ended November 30, 2022, when compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2021, with same-store sales at the Company’s domestic franchise frozen yogurt cafés increasing 19.2% during the nine months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2021.
The increase in franchise fee revenue for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2021, was the result of store closures and the acceleration of unrecognized franchise fee revenue, and more franchise agreements outstanding and subject to revenue recognition.

Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
Factory gross margins decreased to 19.9% in the nine months ended November 30, 2022, compared to a gross margin of 21.2% during the nine months ended November 30, 2021, due primarily to an increase in costs from wage and material inflation and the impacts of Employee Retention Credits recognized in the nine months ended November 30, 2021, with no comparable credits in the nine months ended November 30, 2022. These cost increases were partially offset by an increase in product prices. The Company recognized approximately $155,000 of payroll tax benefit associated with Employee Retention Credits (“ERC”) in the nine months ended November 30, 2021. ERCs were enacted by the CARES Act in March 2020. In December 2020 the Consolidated Appropriations Act extended eligibility for the credits allowing the Company to retroactively benefit from ERCs.
Retail gross margins decreased from 65.8% during the nine months ended November 30, 2021, to 62.6% during the nine months ended November 30, 2022. The decrease in retail gross margins was primarily the result of an increase in the costs of raw materials.
Franchise Costs
The decrease in franchise costs in the nine months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2021, was due primarily to a decrease in professional fees, the result of litigation with our licensee in Canada incurred during the nine months ended November 30, 2021, with no comparable legal expense in the nine months ended November 30, 2022. As a percentage of total royalty and marketing fees and franchise fee revenue, franchise costs decreased to 29.6% in the nine months ended November 30, 2022, from 33.3% in the nine months ended November 30, 2021. This decrease as a percentage of royalty, marketing, and franchise fees is primarily the result of lower franchise costs.
Sales and Marketing
The increase in sales and marketing costs for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2021, was due to an increase in equity compensation costs and contract labor associated with the retirement of Edward Dudley, and an increase in advertising costs.
General and Administrative
The increase in general and administrative costs for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2021, was due primarily to costs associated with a stockholder’s contested solicitation of proxies in connection with our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. During the nine months ended November 30, 2022, the Company incurred approximately $2.9 million of costs associated with the contested solicitation of proxies, compared with $1.7 million of costs associated with a contested solicitation of proxies during the nine months ended November 30, 2021. The Company also incurred increased professional fees related to legal support for our Board of Directors and legal costs associated with compensation arrangements for our former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and legal and professional costs associated with the search for, and appointment of, a new Chief Executive Officer and a new Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, due to a stockholder’s contested solicitation of proxies in connection with our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders the Company had become contingently liable for certain change in control severance payments to Mr. Dudley if a triggering termination was to occur. As a result of Mr. Dudley’s retirement in September 2022, the Company incurred $934,000 of associated severance costs. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 31.5% in the nine months ended November 30, 2022, compared to 27.4% in the nine months ended November 30, 2021.
Retail Operating Expenses
The increase in retail operating expenses for the nine months ended November 30, 2022, compared to the nine months ended November 30, 2021, was due primarily to an increase in salaries and wages, and utilities in our Company-owned stores and cafés. Retail operating expenses, as a percentage of retail sales, increased from 59.1% in the nine months ended November 30, 2021, to 60.2% in the nine months ended November 30, 2022. This increase is primarily the result of higher retail costs.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization, exclusive of depreciation and amortization included in cost of sales, was $383,000 in the nine months ended November 30, 2022, a decrease of 13.0% from $440,000 in the nine months ended November 30, 2021. This decrease was the result of lower amortization of franchise rights, the result of a decrease in frozen yogurt cafés in operation. See Note 7 to the financial statements for a summary of the annual amortization of intangible assets based upon existing intangible assets and current useful lives. Depreciation and amortization included in cost of sales increased 3.4% from $465,000 in the nine months ended November 30, 2021, to $480,000 in the nine months ended November 30, 2022. This increase was the result of investment in equipment.
Other Income
Other income was $9,600 in the nine months ended November 30, 2022, compared to other income of $176,500 during the nine months ended November 30, 2021. Net interest income was $9,600 in the nine months ended November 30, 2022, compared to interest income of $9,300 during the nine months ended November 30, 2021.

The Company recognized a gain on insurance recovery of $167,100 during the nine months ended November 30, 2021, compared with no similar amounts recognized during the nine months ended November 30, 2022.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
During the nine months ended November 30, 2022, we incurred income tax expense of $1.4 million on a loss before income taxes of $2.6 million. This expense was the result of recording a full reserve on our deferred income tax asset. Our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended November 30, 2021, was 20.2%. See Note 14 to the financial statements for a description of income taxes, deferred tax assets, and associated reserves.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of November 30, 2022, working capital was $7.4 million, compared to $9.7 million as of February 28, 2022, a decrease of $2.3 million. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to costs associated with a stockholder’s contested solicitation of proxies in connection with our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders.
Cash and cash equivalent balances decreased approximately $4.4 million to $3.2 million as of November 30, 2022, compared to $7.6 million as of February 28, 2022. This decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to funding of a rabbi trust established for severance payments to our former Chief Executive Officer and the resulting $1.3 million decrease in cash balances and an increase in inventory of $2.1 million. Our current ratio was 2.2 to 1 at November 30, 2022, compared to 2.8 to 1 at February 28, 2022. We monitor current and anticipated future levels of cash and cash equivalents in relation to anticipated operating, financing and investing requirements.
During the nine months ended November 30, 2022, we had a net loss of $4.0 million. Operating activities used cash of $3,583,418, with the principal adjustment to reconcile the net income to net cash used by operating activities being deferred income taxes of $1,388,271, depreciation and amortization of $863,322, an increase in accounts payable of $1,976,869 and expense recorded for stock compensation of $471,530, mostly offset by an increase in inventory of $2,091,099, a decrease in accrued liabilities of $1,284,330 and an increase in accounts receivable of $1,171,146. During the comparable 2021 period, we had a net loss of $700,908, and operating activities provided cash of $857,048. The principal adjustment to reconcile the net income to net cash used by operating activities being an increase in accrued liabilities of $1,343,856, an increase in accounts payable of $1,079,671, depreciation and amortization of $904,972, and expense related to stock-based compensation of $709,210, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $985,887 and an increase in inventory of $936,483.
During the nine months ended November 30, 2022, investing activities used cash of $787,824, primarily due to the purchases of property and equipment of $810,732. In comparison, investing activities used cash of $407,457 during the nine months ended November 30, 2021, primarily due to the purchases of property and equipment of $704,462 partially offset by proceeds from insurance recovery of $206,336.
During the nine months ended November 30, 2022, there were no cash flows from financing activities. In comparison, financing activities used cash of $61,276 in the nine months ended November 30, 2021, due to the redemption of the shareholder rights plan.
The Company believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and working capital requirements for FY 2023. If necessary, the Company has an available bank line of credit to help meet these requirements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of November 30, 2022, except for the purchase obligations as described below, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations.
As of November 30, 2022, we had purchase obligations of approximately $36,000. These purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual obligations for future purchases of commodities for use in our manufacturing.
Impact of Inflation
Inflationary factors such as increases in the costs of ingredients and labor directly affect our operations. Most of our leases provide for cost-of-living adjustments and require us to pay taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses, all of which are subject to inflation. Additionally, our future lease costs for new facilities may include potentially escalating costs of real estate and construction. There is no assurance that we will be able to pass on increased costs to our customers.
Depreciation expense is based on the historical cost to us of our fixed assets and is therefore potentially less than it would be if it were based on the current replacement cost. While property and equipment acquired in prior years will ultimately have to be replaced at higher prices, it is expected that replacement will be a gradual process over many years.
Seasonality
We are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales, which cause fluctuations in quarterly results of operations. Historically, the strongest sales of our products have occurred during key holidays and the summer vacation season. In addition, quarterly results have been, and in the future are likely to be, affected by the timing of new store openings and sales of franchises. Because of the seasonality of our business and the impact of new store openings and sales of franchises, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved in other quarters or for a full fiscal year.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that material information relating to us is made known to the officers who certify as to our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of November 30, 2022.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended November 30, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
