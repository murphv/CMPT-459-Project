Table of Contents NEW ENGLAND REALTY ASSOCIATES LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AND SUBSIDIARIES ​ NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ​ September 30, 2022 ​ (Unaudited) ​ NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
​ Line of Business : New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership (“NERA”, the “Company” or the “Partnership”) was organized in Massachusetts in 1977. NERA and its subsidiaries own
29
properties which include
21
residential buildings;
4
mixed use residential, retail and office buildings;
3
commercial buildings and individual units at
one
condominium complex. These properties total
2,892
apartment units,
19
condominium units and
108,043
square feet of commercial space. Additionally, the Partnership also owns a
40
-
50 % interest in
7
residential and mixed use properties consisting of
688
apartment units,
12,500
square feet of commercial space and a
50
car parking lot. The properties are located in Eastern Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire.
​ Basis of Presentation:
The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s historical experience that are believed to be reasonable at the time. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgement. The Partnership’s critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain. Different estimates could have a material effect on the Partnership’s financial results. Judgements and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions and circumstances. Principles of Consolidation :
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NERA and its subsidiaries. NERA has a
99.67 % to
100 % ownership interest in each subsidiary except for the
seven
limited liability companies (the “Investment Properties” or “Joint Ventures”) in which the Partnership has a
40  -  50 % ownership interest. The consolidated group is referred to as the “Partnership”. Minority interests are not recorded, since they are insignificant. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Partnership accounts for its investment in the above-mentioned Investment Properties using the equity method of consolidation. (See Note 14: Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.) ​ The Partnership accounts for its investments in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Generally, the Partnership would discontinue applying the equity method when the investment (and any advances) is reduced to
zero
and would not provide for additional losses unless the Partnership has guaranteed obligations of the venture or is otherwise committed to providing further financial support for the investee. If the venture subsequently generates income, the Partnership only recognizes its share of such income to the extent it exceeds its share of previously unrecognized losses. In 2013 and beyond, the carrying values of some investments fell below zero. We intend to fund our share of the investments’ future operating deficits should the need arise. However, we have
no
legal obligation to pay for any of the liabilities of such investments nor do we have any legal obligation to fund operating deficits. (See Note 14: Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.) ​ The authoritative guidance on consolidation provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights (“variable interest entities” or “VIEs”) and the determination of which business enterprise, if any, should consolidate the VIE (the “primary beneficiary”). Generally, the consideration of whether an entity is a VIE applies when either (1) the equity investors (if any) lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that equity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the
8
Table of Contents variable interest entity’s performance; and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and rights to receive the returns from VIE that would be significant to the VIE. ​ Impairment:
On an annual basis management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Partnership’s rental properties or investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries may be impaired. In addition to identifying any specific circumstances which may affect a property or properties, management considers other criteria for determining which properties may require assessment for potential impairment. The criteria considered by management include reviewing low leased percentages, significant near term lease expirations, recently acquired properties, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, near term mortgage debt maturities or other factors that might impact the Partnership’s intent and ability to hold property. A property’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property. The Partnership’s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and costs to operate each property. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management’s assumptions, the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be achieved. ​ Revenue Recognition:
Rental income from residential and commercial properties is recognized over the term of the related lease. For residential tenants, amounts
60 days  in arrears are charged against income. The commercial tenants are evaluated on a case by case basis. Certain leases of the commercial properties provide for increasing stepped minimum rents, which are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Revenue from commercial leases also include reimbursements and recoveries received from tenants for certain costs as provided in the lease agreement. The costs generally include real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, common area maintenance and recoverable costs. Rental concessions are also accounted for on the straight-line basis. ​ Above-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the differences between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options for below-market leases .
The capitalized above-market lease amounts are accounted for as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options of the respective leases. ​ The Partnership evaluates the non-lease components (lease arrangements that include common area maintenance services) with related lease components (lease revenues). If both the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease component and related lease component, the lease component is the predominant component. The Partnership elected an allowed practical expedient. For (i) operating lease arrangements involving real estate that include common area maintenance services and (ii) all real estate arrangements that include real estate taxes and insurance costs, we present these amounts within lease revenues in our consolidated statements of income. We record amounts reimbursed by the lessee in the period in which the applicable expenses are incurred. ​ Rental Properties:
Rental properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; improvements and additions which improve or extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of the asset and related accumulated depreciation is eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss on such disposition is included in income. Fully depreciated assets are removed from the accounts. Rental properties are depreciated by both straight-line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives. Upon acquisition of rental property, the Partnership estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed, generally consisting of the fair value of (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place leases and (iii) tenant relationships. The Partnership allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The Partnership records goodwill or a gain on bargain purchase (if any) if the net assets acquired/liabilities assumed exceed the purchase consideration of a transaction. In estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, the Partnership considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence and marketing and leasing
9
Table of Contents activities, and utilizes various valuation methods, such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates, estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation, and available market information. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. ​ Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values and tenant relationship values, which are based on management’s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease and the Partnership’s overall relationship with the respective tenant. Factors to be considered by management in its analysis of in-place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, management considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of the Partnership’s existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant’s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. The value of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases. The value of tenant relationship intangibles are amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships. ​ In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property may be impaired, an analysis of the value is prepared. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows are compared to the asset’s carrying value to determine if a write-down to fair value is required. ​ Leasing Fees:
Leasing fees are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the related lease. Unamortized balances are expensed when the corresponding fee is no longer applicable.
​ Deferred Financing Costs : Costs incurred in obtaining financing are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related indebtedness. Deferred financing costs are presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt liability to which they relate, except deferred financing costs related to the revolving credit facility, which are presented in prepaid expenses and other assets. In all cases, amortization of such costs is included in interest expense and was approximately $ 350,000
and $ 180,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. ​ Income Taxes:
The financial statements have been prepared on the basis that NERA and its subsidiaries are entitled to tax treatment as partnerships. Accordingly,
no
provision for income taxes have been recorded (See Note 13). ​ Cash Equivalents:
The Partnership considers cash equivalents to be all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. ​ Investments in Treasury Bills:
Investments in Treasury Bills are recorded at amortized cost and classified as held to maturity as the Partnership has the intent and the ability to hold them until they mature. The carrying value of the Treasury Bills are adjusted for accretion of discounts over the remaining life of the investment. Income related to the Treasury Bills is recognized in interest income in the Partnership’s consolidated statement of income.
​ Segment Reporting:
Operating segments are revenue producing components of the Partnership for which separate financial information is produced internally for management. Under the definition, NERA operated, for all periods presented, as
one
segment. ​ Comprehensive Income:
Comprehensive income is defined as changes in partners’ equity, exclusive of transactions with owners (such as capital contributions and dividends). NERA did not have any comprehensive income items in 2022 or 2021 other than net income as reported. ​ Income (Loss) Per Depositary Receipt:
Effective January 3, 2012, the Partnership authorized a
3 -for-1 forward split of its Depositary Receipts listed on the NYSE Amex and a concurrent adjustment of the exchange ratio of Depositary Receipts for Class A Units of the Partnership from
10 -to-1 to
30 -to-1, such that each Depositary Receipt represents one-thirtieth
( 1 / 30 )
of a Class A Unit of the Partnership. All references to Depositary Receipts in the report are reflective of the 3-for-1 forward split. ​ 10
Table of Contents Income Per Unit:
Net income per unit has been calculated based upon the weighted average number of units outstanding during each period presented. The Partnership has
no
dilutive units and, therefore, basic net income is the same as diluted net income per unit (see Note 7: Partner’s Capital). ​ Concentration of Credit Risks and Financial Instruments:
The Partnership’s properties are located in New England, and the Partnership is subject to the general economic risks related thereto. No single tenant accounted for more than
5 % of the Partnership’s revenues in 2022 or 2021. The Partnership makes its temporary cash investments with high-credit quality financial institutions. At September 30, 2022, substantially all of the Partnership’s cash and cash equivalents were held in interest-bearing accounts at financial institutions, and investments in U.S. Treasury bills, earning interest at rates from
0.01 % to
2.19 %. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively approximately $ 45,045,000 , and $ 96,166,000
of cash and cash equivalents, and security deposits included in prepaid expenses and other assets exceeded federally insured amounts. ​ Advertising Expense:
Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $ 190,316
and $ 240,814
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
Rental
Property
Held
f or Sale:
When assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Partnership discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price, net of selling costs, of such assets. The Partnership generally considers assets to be held for sale when the transaction has received appropriate corporate authority, and there are no significant contingencies relating to the sale. If, in management’s opinion, the estimated net sales price, net of selling costs, of the assets which have been identified as held for sale is less than the carrying value of the assets, a valuation allowance is established. Interest Capitalized:
The Partnership follows the policy of capitalizing interest as a component of the cost of rental property when the time of construction exceeds
one year . During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 there was
no
capitalized interest. ​ Extinguishment of Debt:
When existing mortgages are refinanced with the same lender and it is determined that the refinancing is substantially different, then they are recorded as an extinguishment of debt. However, if it is determined that the refinancing is substantially the same, then they are recorded as an exchange of debt. All refinancings qualify as extinguishment of debt. ​ Reclassification:
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts in order to conform to current period presentation. ​ NOTE 2. RENTAL PROPERTIES

On July 31, 2014, the Partnership entered into an agreement for a $ 25,000,000
revolving line of credit.
The term of the line was for
three years
with a floating interest rate equal to a base rate of the greater of (a) the Prime Rate (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus
one -half of one percent per annum, or (c) the LIBOR Rate for a period of one month plus
1 %
per annum, plus the
applicable margin of
2.5 %. The agreement originally expired on July 31, 2017, and was extended until October 31, 2020. The costs associated with the line of credit extension were approximately $ 128,000 . Prior to the line’s expiration in 2020, the Partnership exercised its option for a
one -year extension until October 31, 2021. The Partnership paid an extension fee of approximately $ 37,500
in association with the extension. On October 29, 2021,
t he Partnership closed on the modification of its existing line of credit. The agreement extends the credit line for
three years
until October 29, 2024. The commitment amount is for $ 25
million but is restricted to $ 17
million during the modification period. The modification period covers the current period and phases out by December 31, 2022.
During this period, the loan covenants are modified from a minimum consolidated debt service ratio of
1.60
to a ratio of
1.35
until September 30, 2022; from a minimum tangible net worth requirement of $ 200
million to a net worth of $ 175
million until September 30, 2022; from a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of
65 % to a ratio of
70 % until September 30, 2022 and from a minimum debt yield of
9.5 % to a yield of
8.5 % until September 30, 2022 and a yield of
9.0 % until December 31, 2022. Once the financial performance of the Partnership meets the original covenant tests for the trailing 12-month period, the commitment amount will return to $ 25
million. The portfolio’s debt yield fell below the minimum of
8.5 % to
8.05 %. As of September 30, 2022, the Partnership did not comply with the debt yield financial covenant. As such, the Partnership is unable to draw down any amount from the line of credit until the Partnership meets the required financial covenants.
The interest rate for the new term is LIBOR plus
300
basis points. The costs associated with the modification and renewal of the line of credit was approximately $ 179,000 .
On December 3, 2021, the Partnership paid off the outstanding balance of $ 17,000,000
on the Line of Credit.
The line of credit may be used for acquisition, refinancing, improvements, working capital and other needs of the Partnership. The line may not be used to pay dividends, make distributions or acquire equity interests of the Partnership. The line of credit is collateralized by varying percentages of the Partnership’s ownership interest in

September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we do not have any significant financial assets or financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our consolidated financial statements. ​ Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value ​ At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 the carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and note payable, accounts payable and accrued expenses were representative of their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments or, the recent acquisition of these items. The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash include cash held in checking, U.S. Treasury Bills, and money market accounts. ​ The Partnership has investments in Treasury Bills some of which mature over a period greater than 90 days and are classified as short-term investments. The Treasury Bills are carried at amortized cost and classified as held to maturity as the Partnership has the intent and the ability to hold them until they mature. The carrying value of the Treasury Bills are adjusted for accretion of discounts over the remaining life of the investment. Income related to the Treasury Bills is recognized in interest income in the Partnership’s consolidated statement of income. The Treasury Bills classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy. ​ At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 we estimated the fair value of our mortgages payable and other notes based upon quoted market prices for the same (Level 1) or similar (Level 2) issues when current quoted market prices are available. We estimated the fair value of our secured mortgage debt that does not have current quoted market prices available by discounting the future cash flows using rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities (Level 3). The differences in the fair value of our debt from the carrying value are the result of differences in interest rates and/or borrowing spreads that were available to us at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, as compared with those in effect when the debt was issued or acquired. The secured mortgage debt contain pre-payment penalties or yield maintenance provisions that could make the cost of refinancing the debt at lower rates exceed the benefit that would be derived from doing so. ​ The following methods and assumptions were used by the Partnership in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments: ​ ● For cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other assets, investment in partnerships, accounts payable, advance rents and security deposits: fair value approximates the carrying value of such assets and liabilities. ​ ● For mortgage notes payable: fair value is generally based on estimated future cash flows, which are discounted using the quoted market rate from an independent source for similar obligations. Refer to the table below for the carrying amount and estimated fair value of such instruments. ​ 17

Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since September 30, 2022 and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. ​ NOTE 13. TAXABLE INCOME AND TAX BASIS ​ Taxable income reportable by the Partnership and includable in its partners’ tax returns is different than financial statement income because of tax free exchanges, different depreciation methods, different tax lives, other items with limited tax deductibility carryovers and timing differences related to prepaid rents, allowances and intangible assets at significant acquisitions. Federal taxable income of approximately $ 4,056,000
was approximately $ 6,756,000
more than statement income for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Federal cumulative tax basis of the Partnership’s real estate at December 31, 2021 is approximately $ 10,946,000
more than the statement basis. The primary reasons for the difference in tax basis are tax free exchanges, accelerated depreciation and bonus depreciation. The Partnership’s Federal tax basis in its joint venture investments is approximately $ 1,066,000
more than statement basis. State taxable income may be significantly different due to different tax treatments for certain items.
Certain entities included in the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements are subject to certain state taxes. These taxes are not significant and are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Partnership adopted the amended provisions related to uncertain tax provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes. As a result of the implementation of the guidance, the Partnership recognized no material adjustment regarding its tax accounting treatment. The Partnership expects to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, as income tax expense, which would be included in general and administrative expense. ​ In the normal course of business the Partnership or one of its subsidiaries is subject to examination by federal, state and local jurisdictions in which it operates, where applicable. As of September 30, 2022, the tax years that generally remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions under the statute of limitations is from the year 2018 forward. ​ ​ 18

percent of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis to the 401(k) Plan, subject to certain limitations imposed by federal law.  ​ The amounts contributed by employees are immediately vested and non-forfeitable.  Beginning January 1, 2019, the Partnership matched
50 % up to
6 % of compensation deferred by each employee in the 401(k) plan. The Partnership may make discretionary matching or profit-sharing contributions to the 401(k) Plan on behalf of eligible participants in any plan year.  Participants are always
100
percent vested in their pre-tax contributions and will begin vesting in any matching or profit-sharing contributions made on their behalf after
two years
of service with the Partnership at a rate of
20
percent per year, becoming 100 percent vested after a total of
six years
of service with the Partnership. Total expense recognized by the Partnership for the 401(k) Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $ 70,000 .
​ NOTE 16. IMPACT OF RECENTLY-ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ​ There have been no new accounting pronouncements applicable to the Partnership that would have a material impact on the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements. ​ NOTE 17. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
From October 1, 2022, through January 19, 2023, the Partnership has purchased
1,658
Depository Receipts .
The average price was $ 76.58
per receipt, or $ 2,297.40
per unit. The total cost was $ 127,565 . The Partnership is required to purchase
13
Class B units and
1
General Partnership units at a cost of $ 30,154
and $ 1,587 , respectively. ​ On October 3, 2022, the Management Company was the target of a ransomware attack. The Management Company has been engaged by the General Partner, to perform general management functions for the Company’s properties in exchange for management fees.
After becoming aware of the incident, the Management Company conducted an initial investigation into their digital environment and discovered that all on premise computer systems were encrypted. The Management Company worked with independent third-party cybersecurity specialists through its outside counsel to help with the restoration of the environment and to return operations securely. Hamilton maintains off-site data backups, which were verified to have not been compromised by the ransomware attack and were utilized to restore the data that had been encrypted. The Management Company has successfully recovered the impacted files and rebuilt its computer systems, adding additional security features designed to protect its systems and data from future attacks. This incident was previously reported in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 11, 2022.
​ On October 14, 2022, the Partnership entered into a modification agreement with Brookline Bank modifying its loan on 659-665 Worcester Road, Framingham, MA. The agreement modifies the loan on the existing debt of $ 5,954,546.14 , extending the maturity until October 14, 2032, at an interest rate of
4.6 %, interest only for
2 years
and amortizing using a
thirty-year
schedule for the balance of the term.  The agreement also allows for an earn out of up to an additional $ 1,495,453.86
once the property performance reaches a
1.35 x debt service coverage ratio and the loan to value equates to at least
65 %. ​ On November 15, 2022, (the Partnership received a notification letter from the Corporate Compliance Department of the NYSE American Exchange (the “NYSE American”) indicating that as of November 15, 2022, the Partnership is not in compliance with the NYSE American’s standards for continued listing of the Partnership’s Depositary Receipts on the NYSE American as set forth in Section 1007 of the NYSE American Company Guide (the “Company Guide”).
The Partnership failed to timely file (the “Filing Delinquency”) the Partnership’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 (the “Delayed Report”).
The NYSE American notification letter has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Partnership’s Depositary Receipts on the NYSE American, nor will it have any effect on the Partnership's financial condition or results of operations.  The Filing Delinquency is the result of the above-mentioned cybersecurity incident and was previously reported in the Partnership’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 21, 2022. The Filing Delinquency will be cured via the filing of the Delayed Report, which is this Form 10-Q. ​ 26
Table of Contents In November 2022, the Partnership approved a quarterly distribution of $ 9.60
per Unit ($ 0.32
per Receipt), payable on December 31, 2022. ​ On December 5, 2022, Andrew Bloch , the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of the Management Company, which has been engaged by
the Partnership to manage the properties of the Partnership, resigned as Chief Financial Officer.
Mr. Bloch will continue to work with Hamilton on a consultative basis to ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities to the new CFO.
Mr. Bloch remains a director of the General Partner, and of the Management Company.
Mr. Bloch’s
decision to resign as CFO is not the result of any disagreement with the Partnership on any matter relating to the Partnership’s operations, policies, or practices.
Mr. Bloch
has served as CFO of the Management Company since 1998. Effective as of December 5, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Management Company elected Karen N. Zermani as CFO of the Management Company to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Mr. Bloch as CFO. ​ On December 12, 2022, the Partnership signed a purchase and sale agreement to purchase a commercial retail property of approximately
20,700
square feet, located at 659 Worcester Road in Framingham, Massachusetts for the sum of approximately $ 10,151,000 . The Partnership has made a deposit of $ 500,000
to secure the transaction. This acquisition will be funded from the Partnership’s cash reserves. The Partnership closed on the transaction on January 18,2023. ​ On December 19, 2022, a class action was commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against a number of parties, including the Company:  Billie Jo White v. RealPage, Inc., et al, Case No. 1:22-cv-12134, United States District Court, District of Massachusetts (“RealPage Litigation”). ​ The first named defendant, RealPage, Inc., is allegedly the developer of a certain software platform known as “AI Revenue Management” (previously known as “YieldStar”).  In addition to RealPage, the Complaint names as defendants several companies, including the Company, allegedly owning, operating and/or managing residential real estate in the Greater Boston Metro Area (collectively, “Defendant Property Managers”).  The Complaint alleges that through the combined use of RealPage’s revenue management services, which allegedly included collecting non-public data regarding various factors influencing rents and generating a suggested rental price for each of the units controlled by a Defendant Property Manager using its services, the Defendant Property Managers constitute a rental “price-fixing cartel” in violation of federal and state anti-trust laws.  The Complaint seeks class certification and unspecified damages, trebled, together with attorney’s fees and other injunctive relief.  No class has yet been certified. ​ The Company disputes the allegations made against it and intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. ​ The named Defendant Property Managers are the following:  Greystar Real Estate Partners, LLC; Cushman & Wakefield, Inc.; Lincoln Property Company; Peabody Properties, Inc.; New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership; WinnCompanies LLC and WinnResidential Manager Corp., UDR, Inc., SHP Management Corp., The Related Companies, Inc. and Simpson Property Group, LLLP. ​ ​ ​ ITEM 2.

With interest rates rising, and a threat of an economic slowdown, the Partnership increased the debt level and built cash reserves to acquire additional properties when opportunities become available. Currently, $90,000,000 of these reserves are invested in short-term US Treasury bills maturing in 6 months or less with interest rates between 2.1% and 3.75%. ​ Since the Partnership’s long-term goals include the acquisition of additional properties, a portion of the proceeds from the refinancing and sale of properties is reserved for this purpose. If available acquisitions do not meet the Partnership’s investment criteria, the Partnership may purchase additional depositary receipts. The Partnership will
consider refinancing existing properties if the Partnership’s cash reserves are insufficient to repay existing mortgages or if the Partnership needs additional funds for future acquisitions.
​ More than two years has passed since we became aware of the
outbreak of COVID- 19, The World Health Organization declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. On March 10, 2020 the Governor of Massachusetts
declared a state of emergency and ordered all non-essential businesses closed. Additionally, March of 2020 saw the closure of local colleges and universities for the balance of the academic year. Colleges in the City of Boston and the surrounding communities conducted classes in the 2020/2021 academic year remotely, or using a hybrid model of remote and limited in class learning. These educational models caused a large decrease in the student population and resulted in significant vacancies in the Partnership’s apartment portfolio.
​ With the introduction and roll out of COVID vaccines in the spring of 2021, the economy was opening back up.
The Governor of Massachusetts rescinded the State’s COVID-19 restrictions on May 29, 2021 and terminated the State of Emergency on June 15, 2021.
The local colleges and universities returned to campus in September 2021 and the rental market improved significantly as students returned to the area.
​ On February 24, 2022, Russia began an invasion into Ukraine. In response, nations from around the world have placed sanctions on Russia in an attempt to cripple its economy. There is no way to predict how this conflict and the Russian sanctions will affect both the global and local economies.  If there is a downturn in the economy and significant inflation to the cost of energy, goods and service, there may be material adverse effects to our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
​ The vacancy rate for the Partnership’s residential properties as of November 1, 2022 was 1.8% as compared with a vacancy rate of 2.5% as of November 1, 2021. The vacancy rate for the Joint Venture properties as of November 1, 2022 was 0.9%, as compared to 2.8% for the same period last year. The current vacancy rates are in line with those experienced prior to the Pandemic. ​ Residential tenants generally have lease terms of 12 months. The majority of these leases will mature during the second and third quarters of the year.
​ During the third quarter of 2022, rents increased on average of 6.7% for renewals and increased on average of 18.2% for new leases. For the balance of 2022, management expects a strong rental market with continued rent growth. ​ For the third quarter of 2022, consolidated revenue increased by 7.2%, operating expenses increased by 1.0 % and Income before Other Income (Expense) increased by 28.4%, as compared to the third quarter of 2021. ​ On July 31, 2014, the Partnership entered into an agreement for a $25,000,000 revolving line of credit.
The term of the line was for three years with a floating interest rate equal to a base rate of the greater of (a) the Prime Rate (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus one-half of one percent per annum, or (c) the LIBOR Rate for a period of one month plus 1% per annum, plus the applicable margin of 2.5%. The agreement originally expired on July 31, 2017, and was extended until October 31, 2020. The costs associated with the line of credit extension were approximately $128,000.
Prior to the line’s expiration in 2020, the Partnership exercised its option for a one-year extension until October 31, 2021. The Partnership paid an extension fee of approximately $37,500 in association with the extension. 28
Table of Contents On October 29, 2021,
t he Partnership closed on the modification of its existing line of credit. The agreement extends the credit line for three years until October 29, 2024. The commitment amount is for $25 million but is restricted to $17 million during the modification period. The modification period covers the current period and phases out by December 31, 2022.
During this period, the loan covenants are modified from a minimum consolidated debt service ratio of 1.60 to a ratio of 1.35 until September 30, 2022; from a minimum tangible net worth requirement of $200 million to a net worth of $175 million until September 30, 2022; from a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 65% to a ratio of 70% until September 30, 2022 and from a minimum debt yield of 9.5% to a yield of 8.5% until September 30, 2022 and a yield of 9.0% until December 31, 2022. Once the financial performance of the Partnership meets the original covenant tests for the trailing 12-month period, the commitment amount will return to $25 million. The portfolio’s debt yield fell below the minimum of 8.5% to 8.05%. As of September 30, 2022, the Partnership did not comply with the debt yield financial covenant. As such, the Partnership is unable to draw down any amount from the line of credit until the Partnership meets the required financial covenants.
From the start of the Stock Repurchase Program in 2007 through September 30, 2022, the Partnership has purchased 1,486,802 Depositary Receipts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Partnership purchased a total of 52,613 Depositary Receipts.
​ At November 1, 2022, the Harold Brown related entities and Ronald Brown collectively own approximately 31.7% of the Depositary Receipts representing the Partnership Class A Units (including Depositary Receipts held by trusts for the benefit of such persons’ family members). Harold Brown related entities also control 75% of the Partnership’s Class B Units, and 75% of the capital stock of NewReal, Inc. (“NewReal”), the Partnership’s sole general partner. Ronald Brown also owns 25% of the Partnership’s Class B Units and 25% of NewReal’s capital stock. In addition, Ronald Brown is the President and director of NewReal and Jameson Brown is NewReal’s Treasurer and a director. The 75% of the issued and outstanding Class B units of the Partnership are owned by HBC Holdings LLC, an entity of which Jameson Brown is the manager.
The outstanding stock of The Hamilton Company, Inc. is controlled by Jameson Brown and Harley Brown. The 75% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of NewReal, is owned by the Harold Brown 2013 Revocable Trust (the “2013 Trust”), an entity of which Sally Michaels and David Reier are the trustees.
​ In addition to the Management Fee, the Partnership Agreement further provides for the employment of outside professionals to provide services to the Partnership and allows NewReal to charge the Partnership for the cost of employing professionals to assist with the administration of the Partnership’s properties. Additionally, from time to time, the Partnership pays Hamilton for repairs and maintenance services, legal services, construction services and accounting services. The costs charged by Hamilton for these services are at the same hourly rate charged to all entities managed by Hamilton, and management believes such rates are competitive in the marketplace.
​ Residential tenants sign a one year lease. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, tenant renewals were approximately 68% with an average rental increase of approximately 6.2%, new leases accounted for approximately 32% with rental rate increases of approximately 16.1%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, leasing commissions were approximately $264,000 compared to approximately $642,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, a decrease of approximately $378,000 (59.0%). Tenant concessions were approximately $39,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to approximately $34,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of approximately $5,000 (14.7%). Tenant improvements were approximately $1,723,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to
approximately $1,282,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of approximately $441,000 (34.4%).
​ Hamilton accounted for approximately 2.6% of the repair and maintenance expenses paid for by the Partnership during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2.4 % during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Of the funds paid to Hamilton for this purpose, the great majority was to cover the cost of services provided by the Hamilton maintenance department, including plumbing, electrical, carpentry services, and snow removal for those properties close to Hamilton’s headquarters. Several of the larger Partnership properties have their own maintenance staff. Those properties that do not have their own maintenance staff and are located more than a reasonable distance from Hamilton’s headquarters in Allston, Massachusetts are generally serviced by local, independent companies ​ Hamilton’s legal department handles most of the Partnership’s eviction and collection matters. Additionally, it prepares most long-term commercial lease agreements and represents the Partnership in selected purchase and sale
29
Table of Contents transactions. Overall, Hamilton provided approximately $162,000 (72.0%) and approximately $83,000 (60.5%) of the legal services paid for by the Partnership during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 respectively. ​ Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, The Hamilton Company receives similar fees from the Investment Properties. ​ The Partnership requires that three bids be obtained for construction contracts in excess of $15,000. Hamilton may be one of the three bidders on a particular project and may be awarded the contract if its bid and its ability to successfully complete the project are deemed appropriate. For contracts that are not awarded to Hamilton, Hamilton charges the Partnership a construction supervision fee equal to 5% of the contract amount. Hamilton’s architectural department also provides services to the Partnership on an as-needed basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Hamilton provided the Partnership approximately $89,000 in construction and architectural services, compared to approximately $413,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. ​ Hamilton’s accounting staff perform bookkeeping and accounting functions for the Partnership. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, Hamilton charged the Partnership $93,750 for bookkeeping and accounting services. For more information on related party transactions, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ​ CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ​ The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires the Partnership to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The Partnership regularly and continually evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquiring, developing and assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties and its investments in and advances to joint ventures. The Partnership bases its estimates on historical experience, current market conditions, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. The Partnership’s critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about such matters that are highly uncertain. Different estimates could have a material effect on the Partnership’s financial results. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions and circumstances. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Principles of Consolidation. ​ Revenue Recognition:
Rental income from residential and commercial properties is recognized over the term of the related lease. For residential tenants, amounts 60 days in arrears are charged against income. The commercial tenants are evaluated on a case by case basis. Certain leases of the commercial properties provide for increasing stepped minimum rents, which are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Revenue from commercial leases also include reimbursements and recoveries received from tenants for certain costs as provided in the lease agreement. The costs generally include real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, common area maintenance and recoverable costs. Rental concessions are also accounted for on the straight-line basis. ​ Above-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the differences between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options for below-market leases .
The capitalized above-market lease amounts are accounted for as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases, and the capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below-market fixed-rate renewal options of the respective leases. ​ The Partnership evaluates the non-lease components (lease arrangements that include common area maintenance services) with related lease components (lease revenues). If both the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease component and related lease component, the lease component is the predominant component. The Partnership elected an allowed practical expedient. For (i) operating lease arrangements involving real estate that include common area maintenance services and (ii) all real estate arrangements that include real estate taxes and insurance costs,
30
Table of Contents we present these amounts within lease revenues in our consolidated statements of income. We record amounts reimbursed by the lessee in the period in which the applicable expenses are incurred. ​ Rental
Property
Held
f or Sale:
When assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Partnership discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price, net of selling costs, of such assets. The Partnership generally considers assets to be held for sale when the transaction has received appropriate corporate authority, and there are no significant contingencies relating to the sale. If, in management’s opinion, the estimated net sales price, net of selling costs, of the assets which have been identified as held for sale is less than the carrying value of the assets, a valuation allowance is established. ​ If circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and, as a result, the Partnership decides not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale, the property is reclassified as held and used. A property that is reclassified is measured and recorded individually at the lower of (a) its carrying value before the property was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation (amortization) expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used, or (b) the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell. ​ Rental Properties:
Rental properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; improvements and additions are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of the asset and related accumulated depreciation is eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss on such disposition is included in income. Fully depreciated assets are removed from the accounts. Rental properties are depreciated by both straight-line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives. Upon acquisition of rental property, the Partnership estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed, generally consisting of the fair value of (i) above and below market leases, (ii) in-place leases and (iii) tenant relationships. The Partnership allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The Partnership records goodwill or a gain on bargain purchase (if any) if the net assets acquired/liabilities assumed exceed the purchase consideration of a transaction. In estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, the Partnership considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence and marketing and leasing activities, and utilizes various valuation methods, such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates, estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation, and available market information. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. ​ Investments in Treasury Bills:
Investments in Treasury Bills are recorded at amortized cost and classified as held to maturity as the Partnership has the intent and the ability to hold them until they mature. The carrying value of the Treasury Bills are adjusted for accretion of discounts over the remaining life of the investment. Income related to the Treasury Bills is recognized in interest income in the Partnership’s consolidated statement of income.
​ Intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values above and below market leases and tenant relationship values, which are based on management’s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease and the Partnership’s overall relationship with the respective tenant. Factors to be considered by management in its analysis of in-place lease values include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, management considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of the Partnership’s existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant’s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. The value of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases. The value of tenant relationship intangibles are amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships. ​ In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property may be impaired, an analysis of the value is prepared. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows are compared to the asset’s carrying value to determine if a write-down to fair value is required. ​ Impairment:
On an annual basis management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Partnership’s rental properties may be impaired. A property’s value is impaired only if management’s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property. The Partnership’s estimates of aggregate future cash
31
Table of Contents flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, changes in market rental rates, and costs to operate each property. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management’s assumptions, the future cash flows estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be achieved. ​ Investments in Joint Ventures:
The Partnership accounts for its 40%-50% ownership in the Investment Properties under the equity method of accounting, as it exercises significant influence over, but does not control these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for the Partnership’s share in earnings, cash contributions and distributions. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the Partnership is included on the consolidated statements of income. Generally, the Partnership would discontinue applying the equity method when the investment (and any advances) is reduced to zero and would not provide for additional losses unless the Partnership has guaranteed obligations of the venture or is otherwise committed to providing further financial support for the investee. If the venture subsequently generates income, the Partnership only recognizes its share of such income to the extent it exceeds its share of previously unrecognized losses. We intend to fund our share of the investments’ future operating deficits should the need arise. However, we have no legal obligation to pay for any of the liabilities of such investments nor do we have any legal obligation to fund operating deficits. ​ The authoritative guidance on consolidation provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights (“variable interest entities” or “VIEs”) and the determination of which business enterprise, if any, should consolidate the VIE (the “primary beneficiary”). Generally, the consideration of whether an entity is a VIE applies when either (1) the equity investors (if any) lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that equity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the variable interest entity’s performance; and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and rights to receive the returns from VIE that would be significant to the VIE. ​ With respect to investments in and advances to the Investment Properties, the Partnership looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties. An impairment charge is recorded if management’s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. ​ Legal Proceedings:
The Partnership is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise, from time to time, in the ordinary course of business. These matters are frequently covered by insurance. If it is determined that a loss is likely to occur, the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements. Both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered likely can be difficult to determine.

Table of Contents ​ LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
​ The Partnership’s principal source of cash during the first nine months of 2022 and 2021 was the proceeds from the refinancing of 4 properties for approximately $42,000,000 and the collection of rents. The Partnership’s principal use of cash during the first nine months of 2022 was the purchase of Treasury Bills. The majority of cash and cash equivalents of $59,473,939 at September 30, 2022 and $96,083,508 at December 31, 2021 were held in interest bearing accounts at creditworthy financial institutions. ​ The decrease in cash of $36,609,569 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 is summarized as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nine Months Ended September 30,

5,969,285 ​ ​ The change in cash provided by operating activities is due to various factors, including a change in depreciation expense, a change in income and distribution from joint ventures, and other factors. The decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to improvements to rental properties, and the purchase of Treasury Bills. The change in cash used in financing activities is due to the refinancing of 4 properties, the pay down of mortgages, the repurchase of depositary receipts, and distributions paid. ​ During 2022, the Partnership and its Subsidiary Partnerships have completed improvements to certain of the Properties at a total cost of approximately $3,709,000. These improvements were funded from cash reserves. Cash reserves have been adequate to fully fund improvements. The most significant improvements were made at Hamilton Oaks, Captain Parker, Hamilton Green, Westside Colonial, River Drive Apartments, and Redwood Hills at a cost of approximately $747,000, $313,000, $299,000, $292,000, $282,000 and $246,000 respectively.
​ During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Partnership received distributions of approximately $1,207,500 from the investment properties. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Partnership received $590,000 in distributions from the investment properties. Included in these net distributions is the amount from Dexter Park of approximately $840,000 and $80,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
In January 2022, the Partnership approved a quarterly distribution of $9.60 per Unit ($0.32 per Receipt), which was paid on March  31, 2022.
In addition to the quarterly distribution, there was a special distribution of $38.40 per Class A unit ($1.28 per Receipt) payable on March 31, 2022. In April 2022, the Partnership approved a quarterly distribution of $9.60 per Unit ($0.32 per Receipt), which was paid on June 30, 2022. In July 2022, the Partnership approved a quarterly distribution of $9.60 per Unit ($0.32 per Receipt), which was paid on September 30, 2022.
On July 31, 2014, the Partnership entered into an agreement for a $25,000,000 revolving line of credit.
The term of the line was for three years with a floating interest rate equal to a base rate of the greater of (a) the Prime Rate (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus one-half of one percent per annum, or (c) the LIBOR Rate for a period of one month plus 1% per annum, plus the applicable margin of 2.5%. The agreement originally expired on July 31, 2017 and was extended until October 31, 2020. The costs associated with the line of credit extension in 2017 were approximately $128,000.
Prior to the line’s expiration in 2020, the Partnership exercised its option for a one-year extension until October 31, 2021. The Partnership paid an extension fee of approximately $37,500 in association with the extension. The Partnership agreed to terms with the lender on October 29, 2021, to extend the line of credit until October 29, 2024. On December 3, 2021, the Partnership paid off the line. ​ The Partnership anticipates that cash from operations will be sufficient to fund its current operations, pay distributions, make required debt payments and finance current improvements to its properties. The Partnership may also sell or refinance properties. The Partnership’s net income and cash flow may fluctuate dramatically from year to year as

​ Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements—Joint Venture Indebtedness ​ As of September 30, 2022, the Partnership had a 40%-50% ownership interest in seven Joint Ventures, five of which have mortgage indebtedness. We do not have control of these partnerships and therefore we account for them using the equity method of consolidation. At September 30, 2022, our proportionate share of the non-recourse debt related to these investments was approximately $70,835,000. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ​ 39

414,688,581 * Excluding unamortized deferred financing costs ​ We have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. In addition, we have certain other contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year. These contracts are not included as part of our contractual obligations because they include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. See Notes 5 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of mortgage notes payable. The Partnerships has no other material contractual obligations to be disclosed. ​ Factors That May Affect Future Results ​ Along with risks detailed in Item 1A of the Partnership’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 11, 2022 and from time to time in the Partnership’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, some factors that could cause the Partnership’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include but are not limited to the following: ​ ● The Partnership depends on the real estate markets where its properties are located, primarily in Eastern Massachusetts, and these markets may be adversely affected by local economic market conditions, which are beyond the Partnership’s control. ​ ● The Partnership is subject to the general economic risks affecting the real estate industry, such as dependence on tenants’ financial condition, the need to enter into new leases or renew leases on terms favorable to tenants in order to generate rental revenues and our ability to collect rents from our tenants. ​ ● The Partnership is also impacted by changing economic conditions making alternative housing arrangements more or less attractive to the Partnership’s tenants, such as the interest rates on single family home mortgages and the availability and purchase price of single family homes in the Greater Boston metropolitan area. ​ ● The Partnership is subject to significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property. ​ ● The Partnership is subject to increases in heating and utility costs that may arise as a result of economic and market conditions and fluctuations in seasonal weather conditions. ​ ● Civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters may result in uninsured or underinsured losses. ​ ● Actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties. ​ ● Financing or refinancing of Partnership properties may not be available to the extent necessary or desirable, or may not be available on favorable terms. 40
Table of Contents ​ ● The Partnership properties face competition from similar properties in the same market. This competition may affect the Partnership’s ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents that can be charged. ​ ● Given the nature of the real estate business, the Partnership is subject to potential environmental liabilities. These include environmental contamination in the soil at the Partnership’s or neighboring real estate, whether caused by the Partnership, previous owners of the subject property or neighbors of the subject property, and the presence of hazardous materials in the Partnership’s buildings, such as asbestos, lead, mold and radon gas. Management is not aware of any material environmental liabilities at this time. ​ ● Insurance coverage for and relating to commercial properties is increasingly costly and difficult to obtain. In addition, insurance carriers have excluded certain specific items from standard insurance policies, which have resulted in increased risk exposure for the Partnership. These include insurance coverage for acts of terrorism and war, and coverage for mold and other environmental conditions. Coverage for these items is either unavailable or prohibitively expensive. ​ ● Market interest rates could adversely affect market prices for Class A Partnership Units and Depositary Receipts as well as performance and cash flow. ​ ● Changes in income tax laws and regulations may affect the income taxable to owners of the Partnership. These changes may affect the after-tax value of future distributions. ​ ● The Partnership may fail to identify, acquire, construct or develop additional properties; may develop or acquire properties that do not produce a desired or expected yield on invested capital; may be unable to sell poorly- performing or otherwise undesirable properties quickly; or may fail to effectively integrate acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties. ​ ● Risk associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments. ​ ● Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties. ​ ● Any weakness identified in the Partnership’s internal controls as part of the evaluation being undertaken could have an adverse effect on the Partnership’s business. ​ ● Ongoing compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may require additional personnel or systems changes. ​ The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive or as an admission regarding the adequacy of disclosures made by the Partnership prior to the date hereof or the effectiveness of said Act. The Partnership expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ​
ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ​ Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices.
In pursuing its business plan, the primary market risk to which the Partnership is exposed is interest rate risk.
Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between the Partnership’s yield on invested assets and cost of funds and, in turn, its ability to make distributions or payments to its investors. ​ As of September 30, 2022, the Partnership, its Subsidiary Partnerships and the Investment Properties collectively have approximately $581,358,000 in long-term debt, substantially all of which require payment of interest at fixed rates. Accordingly, the fair value of these debt instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. This long term debt matures through 2035. The Partnership, its Subsidiary Partnerships and the Investment Properties collectively have variable rate debt of $10,000,000 (without taking out unamortized deferred financing costs) as of September 30, 2022. Interest rates ranged from LIBOR plus 195 basis points to LIBOR plus 300 basis points. Assuming interest-rate caps are not in effect, if market rates of interest on the Partnership’s variable rate debt increased or decreased by 100
41
Table of Contents basis points, then the increase or decrease in interest costs on the Partnership’s variable rate debt would be approximately $50,000 annually and the increase or decrease in the fair value of the Partnership’s fixed rate debt as of September 30, 2022 would be approximately $24.0 million. For information regarding the fair value and maturity dates of these debt obligations, See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements — “Mortgage Notes Payable,” Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements — “Fair Value Measurements” and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements — “Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures”.

The effectiveness of the Partnership’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) have been evaluated as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Hamilton Company, Inc. (the “Management Company”), Management concluded that IT control and related procedures that support financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2022 due to the material weaknesses described below that prevented the recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act. ​ Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
On October 3, 2022, the Management Company was the target of a ransomware attack. The Partnership did not incur any monetary damage nor any loss of financial data due to the incident. After becoming aware of the incident, the Management Company conducted an internal investigation into their digital environment and discovered that all on premise computer systems were encrypted by an outside party. The Partnership, along with the Management Company, worked with independent third-party cybersecurity specialists to help with the restoration of the environment and to return operations securely. Off-site data backups, which were verified to have not been compromised by the ransomware attack, were utilized to restore the data that had been encrypted. The Partnership, along with the Management Company, has successfully recovered the impacted files and rebuilt its computer systems. However, Management determined that the inordinate amount of time to recover this data and rebuild the financial reporting system prevented the Partnership from filing this Quarterly Report on a timely basis. ​ The Partnership is committed to remediating the material weaknesses in a timely manner. With the assistance of cybersecurity specialists, the Partnership and the Management Company have added additional security features designed to protect its systems and data from future attacks including multifactor authentication for domain sign-on, restricted server access, enhanced security awareness training, and updated multi-location secure backup with regular recovery testing. In addition to these steps already taken, remediation will also include the documentation and testing of the additional IT procedures implemented.
​ Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met.
​ Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Except for the above noted material weaknesses and the remediation activities that have already begun, there were no other changes in the Management Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Management Company’s internal control over financial reporting. ​ ​ ​ ​ 42

14,840 ​ ​ ​ ​ On August 20, 2007, NewReal, Inc., the General Partner authorized an equity repurchase program (“Repurchase Program”) under which the Partnership was permitted to purchase, over a period of twelve months, up to 300,000 Depositary Receipts (each of which is one-tenth of a Class A Unit). Over time, the General Partner has authorized increases in the equity repurchase program. On March 10, 2015, the General Partner authorized an increase in the Repurchase Program from 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 Depository Receipts and extended the Program for an additional five years from March 31, 2015 until March 31, 2020. On March 9, 2020, the General Partner extended the program for an additional five years from March 31, 2020 to March 31, 2025. The Repurchase Program requires the Partnership to repurchase a proportionate number of Class B Units and General Partner Units in connection with any repurchases of any Depositary Receipts by the Partnership based upon the 80%, 19% and 1% fixed distribution percentages of the holders of the Class A, Class B and General Partner Units under the Partnership’s Second Amended and Restated Contract of Limited Partnership. Repurchases of Depositary Receipts or Partnership Units pursuant to the Repurchase Program may be made by the Partnership from time to time in its sole discretion in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions. From August 20, 2007 through September 30, 2022, the Partnership has repurchased 1,486,802 Depositary Receipts at an average price of $30.09 per receipt (or $902.70 per underlying Class A Unit), 4,034 Class B Units and 212 General Partnership Units, both at an average price of $1,179.00 per Unit, totaling approximately $50,336,000 including brokerage fees paid by the Partnership . ​ During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Partnership purchased a total of 52,613 Depositary Receipts. The average price was $78.53 per receipt or $2,355.90 per unit. The cost including commission was $4,134,773. The Partnership was required to repurchase 416.52 Class B Units and 21.92 General Partnership units at a cost of $981,249 and $51,645 respectively.
