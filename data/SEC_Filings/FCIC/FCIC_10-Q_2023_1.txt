The Company undertakes no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise.

See notes to unaudited condensed financial statements     7 Table of Contents   FCCC, INC.   NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)   December 31, 2022
NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION   The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of FCCC, Inc. (the “Company”), have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X, promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.   In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair representation have been included herein. Operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be expected for the year ending March 31, 2023 or other future periods. For further information, refer to the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.   Going concern:   The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered losses that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. While the Company is attempting to attain revenue growth and profitability, the growth has not been significant enough to support the Company’s daily operations. Management may need to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering and make strategic acquisitions. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to improve sales volume and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to further implement its new business plan and generate revenue. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.   Use of Estimates:   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.   Fair value of financial instruments:   Included in various investment related line items in the financial statements are certain financial instruments carried at fair value.  Other financial instruments are periodically measured at fair value, such as when impaired, or, for preferred stock when carried at the lower of cost or market.   The fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.  The fair value of a liability is the amount at which that liability could be incurred or settled in a current transaction between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.   Fair values are based on quoted market prices when available.  When market prices are not available, fair value is generally estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating current market inputs for similar financial instruments with comparable terms and credit quality.  In instances where there is little or no market activity for the same or similar instruments, the Company estimates fair value using methods, models and assumptions that management believes market participants would use to determine a current transaction price.  These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment which becomes significant with increasingly complex instruments or pricing models.  Where appropriate, adjustments are included to reflect the risk inherent in a particular methodology, model or input used.
8 Table of Contents   The Company's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value have been classified, for disclosure purposes, based on a hierarchy defined by SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements.   The hierarchy gives the highest ranking to fair values determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest ranking to fair values determined using methodologies and models with unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset’s or a liability’s classification is based on the lowest level input that is significant to its measurement.  For example, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are both observable (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3).   The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:   Level 1 - Values are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets accessible at the measurement date.   Level 2 –  Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices from those willing to trade in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data for the term of the instrument.  Such inputs include market interest rates and volatilities, spreads and yield curves.   Level 3 – Certain inputs are unobservable (supported by little or no market activity) and significant to the fair value measurement.  Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s best estimate of what hypothetical market participants would use to determine a transaction price for the asset or liability at the reporting date.     Dividends:   The Company may or may not pay cash dividends or make other distributions in the future depending on a number of factors. The Company may, however, pay a cash dividend or other distribution as part of a merger, acquisition, reverse merger or business combination transaction or if the Board of Directors deems it advisable for the benefit of all shareholders at any time.
Income Taxes:   The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes as prescribed by the FASB Accounting Standard Codification, (“ASC”), 740 “Income Taxes”. This method requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax return and financial statement reporting basis of certain assets and liabilities.   As required by ASC 740-10, “Income Taxes”, the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. Management does not believe that there are any uncertain tax positions which would have a material impact on the financial statements. The Company has elected to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. To date, the Company has not recorded any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:   The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
NOTE 2 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
As of December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022, the related party payable amounts to the Director David He are approximately $ 173 ,452 and $ 123 ,000, respectively, in purpose for cover certain operating expenses for the Company.
9 Table of Contents   NOTE 3 – EARNINGS PER SHARE   The Company follows FASB ASC 260,
Earnings Per Share . Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted. Net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.   As of December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding convertible notes which represent
297,242
shares of common stock. These shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share since their effect would have been antidilutive.   As of March 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding convertible notes which represent
304,288
shares of common stock. These shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share since their effect would have been antidilutive.   As of December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding convertible notes which represent
311,295
shares of common stock. These shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share since their effect would have been antidilutive.   Basic and diluted loss per common share was calculated using the following number of shares for the three and Nine months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021:   Three and Nine Months Ended December 31:   2022     2021   Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Basic     3,461,022       3,461,022   Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Diluted     3,461,022       3,461,022     NOTE 4 – INDEBTEDNESS   On September 21, 2020, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to Frederick L. Farrar, a former executive officer, director and significant stockholder of the Company, a Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $ 65,000
(the “Note”) in exchange for a loan of the same amount. The Note accrues interest at
5.0 % per annum and is scheduled to mature and become payable on
October 31, 2022 . The Company’s payment obligations under the Note are unsecured and the Company can prepay the amount due in whole or in part at any time without penalty or premium. The holder of the Note has the option, on or prior to maturity, to convert all (but not less than all) of the amount due under the Note to into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $ 0.23
per share. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the issuance of the Note for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022, the principal and interest due under the Note totaled approximately $ 72,000 .    NOTE 5 – CAPITAL STOCK   The Company is authorized to issue
22,000,000
shares of Common stock, at no par value. At December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, there were
3,461,022
and
3,461,022
shares issued and outstanding, respectively.   NOTE 6 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   After the end date of this reporting period, the Company entered negotiations to acquire a general management and consulting company located in Los Angeles, California. In the coming quarter, Company will file amended and supplementary filings disclosing the transaction’s negotiations and closing events, and the Company plans to no longer continue filing under shell status.     10 Table of Contents   Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding the Company, its business prospects and its results of operations that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties posed by many factors and events that could cause the Company’s actual business, prospects and results of operations to differ materially from those that may be anticipated by such forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties may be summarized in other documents that the Company may file with the Securities Exchange Commission, such as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022. These forward-looking statements reflect our view only as of the date of this report. The Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievement. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update or correct any forward-looking statements.   ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION   The Company has limited operations and is actively seeking a merger, reverse merger, acquisition or business combination opportunities with an operating business or other financial transaction opportunities. Until a transaction is effectuated, the Company does not expect to have significant operations. Accordingly, during this period the Company does not expect to achieve sufficient income to offset the Company’s operating expenses, resulting in operating losses that may require the Company to use and thereby reduce the Company’s limited cash balance. Until the Company completes a merger, reverse merger or other financial transaction, and unless interest rates increase dramatically, the Company expects to continue to incur losses between approximately $15,000 to $20,000 per quarter. The Company does not have any arrangements with banks or financial institutions with respect to the availability of financing in the future.   The payment of any cash distributions is subject to the discretion of our board of directors. At this time, the Company has no plans to pay any additional cash distributions in the foreseeable future.   CURRENT BUSINESS   Since June 2003, the Company’s operations consist of a search for a merger, acquisition, reverse merger or a business transaction opportunity with an operating business or other financial transaction; however, there can be no assurance that this plan will be successfully implemented. Until a transaction is effectuated, the Company does not expect to have significant operations. At this time, the Company has no arrangements or understandings with respect to any potential merger, acquisition, reverse merger or business combination candidate pursuant to which the Company may become an operating company.   Opportunities may come to the Company’s attention from various sources, including our management, our stockholders, professional advisors, securities broker dealers, venture capitalists and private equity funds, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. At this time, the Company has no plans, understandings, agreements, or commitments with any individual or entity to act as a finder in regard to any business opportunities. While it is not currently anticipated that the Company will engage unaffiliated professional firms specializing in business acquisitions, reorganizations or other such transactions, such firms may be retained if such arrangements are deemed to be in the best interest of the Company. Compensation to a finder or business acquisition firm may take various forms, including one-time cash payments, payments involving issuance of securities (including those of the Company), or any combination of these or other compensation arrangements. Consequently, the Company is currently unable to predict the cost of utilizing such services.   The Company has not restricted its search to any particular business, industry, or geographical location. In evaluating a potential transaction, the Company analyzes all available factors and make a determination based on a composite of available facts, without reliance on any single factor.     11 Table of Contents    It is not possible at this time to predict the nature of a transaction in which the Company may participate. Specific business opportunities would be reviewed as well as the respective needs and desires of the Company and the legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable would be selected. In implementing a structure for a particular transaction, the Company may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, tender offer, joint venture, license, purchase and sale of assets, or purchase and sale of stock, or other arrangement the exact nature of which cannot now be predicted. Additionally, the Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other form of organization. Implementing such structure may require the merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with other business organizations and there is no assurance that the Company would be the surviving entity. In addition, our present management and stockholders may not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the Company following reorganization or other financial transaction. As part of such a transaction, some or all of the Company’s existing directors may resign and new directors may be appointed. The Company’s operations following the consummation of a transaction will be dependent on the nature of the transaction. There may also be various risks inherent in the transaction, the nature and magnitude of which cannot be predicted.   The Company may also be subject to increased governmental regulation following a transaction; however, it is not possible at this time to predict the nature or magnitude of such increased regulation, if any.   The Company expects to continue to incur moderate losses each quarter until a transaction considered appropriate by management is effectuated.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION   During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a loss from operations of approximately $19,000. The loss is attributable to the operational, administrative, auditing, tax return preparation, legal and interest expenses incurred during the quarter. During the quarter ended December 31, 2021, the loss from operations was approximately $66,000. No taxes were paid in the quarters ended December 31, 2022 or 2021.   During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a loss from operations of approximately $64,000. The loss is attributable to the operational, administrative, auditing, tax return preparation, legal and interest expenses incurred during the three-month period. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the loss from operations was approximately $173,000. No taxes were paid in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $0 in both nine-month periods.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Stockholders’ deficit as of December 31, 2022, was approximately $248,000, compared to $184,000 at March 31, 2022. The decrease is attributable to the net loss incurred during the nine months ended December 31, 2022.   Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $61,000 during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately $118,000 in the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The net cash from financing activities during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was a result of the payment of operating expenses.  Cash on hand at December 31, 2022 was approximately $150,000, compared to approximately $25,000 at March 31, 2022. The increase in cash on hand was primarily the net result of funds deposited by David He.   Convertible Promissory Note   On September 21, 2020, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Frederick L. Farrar, its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and a member of its board of directors, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to Mr. Farrar a Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $65,000 (the “Note”) in exchange for a loan of the same amount. The Note accrues interest at 5.0% per annum and is scheduled to mature and become payable on October 31, 2022. The Company’s payment obligations under the Note are unsecured and the Company can prepay the amount due in whole or in part at any time without penalty or premium. The holder of the Note has the option, on or prior to maturity, to convert all (but not less than all) of the amount due under the Note to into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.23 per share. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the issuance of the Note for general corporate purposes.   The Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements. There has been no material change in any contractual obligation as reported in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.     12 Table of Contents    Item 3.

Controls and Procedures.   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company’s management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022.   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
