NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION
AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
Network CN Inc. was originally incorporated on
September 10, 1993 in Delaware with headquarters in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China
(“PRC” or “China”).  Since August 2006, the Company has been principally engaged in the provision of
out-of-home advertising in China through the operation of a network of roadside LED digital video panels, mega-size LED digital video
billboards and light boxes in major cities.
Details of the Company’s principal subsidiaries
and variable interest entities as of September 30, 2022, are described in Note 3 – Subsidiaries and Variable Interest Entities.
COVID-19 Pandemic
In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 was
identified in China and was subsequently recognized as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (“WHO”) on March
11, 2020. Since that time, COVID-19 has spread around the world and throughout the United States, including in the regions and countries
in which we operate. Federal, state and local governments in the U.S and around the world have imposed restrictions on travel and business
operations and are advising or requiring individuals to limit or eliminate time outside of their homes. Temporary closures of businesses
have also been ordered in certain jurisdictions, and other businesses have temporarily closed voluntarily. These actions expanded significantly
in March and April of 2020 throughout the U.S. Consequently, the COVID-19 outbreak has severely restricted the level of economic activity
in the U.S. and around the world.
The outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing
numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as quarantines and shelter in place orders. These measures may remain in place for
a significant period of time and adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition as well as the business, operations
and financial conditions of our business partners. The spread of the virus has also caused us to modify our business practices (including
employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings) in ways that may be detrimental to our business (including
working remotely and its attendant cybersecurity risks). We may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that
we determine are in the best interests of our employees. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks
posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities.
There has been no material adverse impact on the
Company’s 2021 and 2022 results of operations to date. The effect of COVID-19 and related events, those not yet known or knowable,
could have a negative effect on the stock price, business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company, including
as a result of quarantines, market volatility, market downturns and business closures.
For the reasons discussed above, the Company cannot
reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact COVID-19 may have on the Company’s results of operations, financial
position, and liquidity. Notwithstanding any actions by national, state, and local governments to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 or by
the Company to address the adverse impacts of COVID-19, there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing activities will be successful
in mitigating or preventing significant adverse effects on the Company.
Recent development
Our Business in Ningbo
The Company explored new media project in Ningbo, China and decided
to restart its business and expects that will improve the Company’s future financial performance. In April 2022, the Company has
established a newly subsidiary, NCN (Ningbo) Culture Media Co., Ltd (“NCN Ningbo”), a wholly foreign-owned enterprise in Ningbo,
China. The Company owns 100% of the established subsidiary company, NCN Ningbo. In August 2022, NCN Ningbo started its operation and acquired
rights to operate advertising panels in Ningbo, China and sell advertising airtime to our customers directly.
Issuance of Convertible Promissory Note
On January 18, 2022, the Company entered into
a Subscription Agreement under which the Subscriber agreed to purchase the 1% Senior Unsecured Convertible Note Agreement from the Company
for an agreement purchase price of two million five hundred thousand US Dollars ($ 2,500,000 ). On the same date, the Company signed the
with 1% Senior Unsecured Convertible Note Agreement under which the Company may sell and issue to the Subscriber up to an aggregate maximum
amount of $ 2,500,000
in principal amount of Convertible Notes prior to January 19, 2027. The Convertible Promissory Notes issued to the
Investor are convertible at the holder’s option into shares of Company common stock at $ 1.25
per share.

Table of Contents
Exercise of conversion option
On October 28, 2021, Keywin Holdings Limited (“Keywin”)
exercised its option to purchase an aggregate of
11,764,756
shares of the Company’ common stock for an aggregate purchase price
of $ 2,000,000
which for setting off against the Company’s obligation to repay part of the short-term loan interest payable, there
was no cash proceeds from the exercise of Keywin option.
Private Placement
On May 3, 2021, the Company entered into Common
Stock Agreement with the foreign investor (the "New investor") that the Company will sell an aggregate of
200,000
shares of
the Company's common stock to the New investor. Pursuant to the terms of a Common Stock Agreement between the Company and the New investor,
the purchase price paid by the New investor for the shares were $3 per share for an aggregate sum of six hundred thousand U.S. dollars.
The Company received $ 459,077
cash proceeds from the investor and $ 140,923
was settled for the interest payable of short-term loans.
Increase of authorized capital
On April 28, 2020, the Board of Directors and
Majority of stockholders of the Company approved to increase the total number of authorized shares of Common Stock from
26,666,667
to
100,000,000,000 . On October 11, 2021, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary
of State to increase our authorized shares of common stock from 26,666,667 to 100,000,000,000 and the increase had approved by Delaware
secretary of state on April 5, 2022
Identification of New projects
On January 14, 2020, the Company entered into
a Letter of Intent with Earthasia Worldwide Holdings Limited (“EWHL”) that the Company will acquire
100 % of the EWHL’s
issued and outstanding stock owned by the shareholders of the EWHL and the EWHL will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
On July 23, 2020, the Company entered into Share
Exchange Agreement with Ease Global Limited (“Ease Global”), the shareholder of Trade More Global Limited (‘Trade More”)
that the Company will purchase,
One Thousand and One Hundred (1,100) currently issued shares of common stock of Trade More from Ease Global
and in exchange for Forty-nine Million (49,000,000) shares of newly-issued shares of common stock of the Company.
The closing of the Exchange
shall occur on other date as agreed by the parties of the Share Exchange Agreement. Upon
completion of the Exchange, 78% of issued shares
of common stock of the Company shall be held by the Ease Global while all of the shares of capital stock of Trade More shall be held by
the Company.
EWHL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Trade More.
The closing of Exchange was not completed on September
2, 2020 which was due to the progress of audit. Since Ease Global cannot fulfill the revenue target and complete the audit, the Company
considered the Share Exchange Agreement was lapsed.
Going Concern
The Company has experienced recurring net losses
$ 176,816
and $ 202,673
for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 respectively, and $ 636,578
and $ 599,737
for the nine months
ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 respectively. As of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company has stockholders’ deficit
of $ 6,384,070
and $ 6,171,255 , respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. The Company’s plans regarding those concerns are addressed in the following paragraph. The unaudited consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
In response to current financial conditions, the
Company has actively explored new prominent media projects in order to provide a wider range of media and advertising services and improve
our financial performance. If the project can start to operate, the Company expects that the project will improve the Company’s
future financial performance. The Company expects that the new project can generate positive cashflow.
9
Table of Contents
The existing cash and cash equivalents together
with highly liquid current assets are insufficient to fund the Company’s operations for the next twelve months. The Company will
need to rely upon some combination of cash generated from the Company’s operations, or proceeds from the issuance of the Company’s
equity and debt securities as well as the exercise of the conversion option by the Company’s note holders to convert the notes to
the Company’s common stock, in order to maintain the Company’s operations. Based on the Company’s best estimates, the
Company believes that there are sufficient financial resources to meet the cash requirements for the coming twelve months and the consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. However, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue
as a going concern. These uncertainties may result in adverse effects on continuation of the Company as a going concern. The accompany
consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
NOTE 2 SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(A) Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements of Network CN Inc., its subsidiaries and variable interest entities (collectively “NCN” or the “Company”
“we”, “our” or “us”) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States (“GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial
information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of our financial
position and results of operations.
The unaudited consolidated financial statements
for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were not audited. It is management’s opinion, however, that
all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments or a description of the nature and amount of any adjustments other
than normal recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair presentation of financial statements. The results for
the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year. The year-end consolidated balance
sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
December 23, 2022. The disclosures made in the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements generally do not repeat those in the
annual statements.
(B)
Principles of Consolidation
The unaudited consolidated financial statements
include the financial statements of Network CN Inc., its subsidiaries and its variable interest entities for which it is the primary beneficiary.
A variable interest entity is an entity in which the Company, through contractual arrangements, bears the risks and enjoys the rewards
normally associated with ownership of the entity. Upon making this determination, the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary
of the entity, which is then required to be consolidated for financial reporting purposes. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.
(C)
Use of Estimates
In preparing unaudited consolidated financial
statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Differences from those estimates
are reported in the period they become known and are disclosed to the extent they are material to the unaudited consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole.
(D)
Convertible Promissory Notes
New 1% Convertible Promissory Notes, due in 2025
On January 14, 2020, the Company issued 1% unsecured
senior convertible promissory notes to an individual with the principal amount of $ 645,000 . The 1% convertible promissory notes bore interest
at
1 % per annum, payable
semi-annually
in arrears, matured on
January 13, 2025 , and were convertible at any time into shares of the Company’s
common stock at a fixed conversion price of $ 1.00
per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.
10
Table of Contents
The Company determined the 1% convertible promissory
notes to be conventional convertible instruments under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Its embedded conversion option qualified
for equity classification. The 1% convertible promissory notes did not have any embedded conversion option which shall be bifurcated and
separately accounted for as a derivative under ASC 815, nor did they contain a cash conversion feature. The Company accounted for the
Notes in accordance with ASC 470, as a single debt instrument. No beneficial conversion feature (the “BCF”) was recognized
as the set conversion price for the Notes was greater than the fair value of the Company’s share price at date of issuance.
New 1% Convertible Promissory Notes, due in 2027
On January 18, 2022, the Company entered into
a Subscription Agreement under which the Subscriber agreed to purchase the 1% Senior Unsecured Convertible Note Agreement from the Company
for an agreement purchase price of two million five hundred thousand US Dollars ($ 2,500,000 ). On the same date, the Company signed the
with 1% Senior Unsecured Convertible Note Agreement under which the Company may sell and issue to the Subscriber up to an aggregate maximum
amount of $ 2,500,000
in principal amount of Convertible Notes prior to January 19, 2027. The Convertible Promissory Notes issued to the
Investor are convertible at the holder’s option into shares of Company common stock at $ 1.25
per share.
The Company evaluates the conversion feature to
determine whether it was beneficial as described in ASC 470-20. The intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible
note payable, which is not bifurcated and accounted for separately from the convertible notes payable and may not be settled in cash upon
conversion, is treated as a discount to the convertible notes payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the date of issuance
to the date the notes is due using the effective interest method. If the notes payable are retired prior to the end of their contractual
term, the unamortized discount is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general, the beneficial conversion feature
is measured by comparing the effective conversion price, after considering the relative fair value of detachable instruments included
in the financing transaction, if any, to the fair value of the shares of common stock at the commitment date to be received upon conversion.
(E)
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with ASC 606,
Revenue From Contracts
with Customers , an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects
the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements
that are within the scope of the standard, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer;
(ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price
to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with
customers. The standard also includes criteria for the capitalization and amortization of certain contract acquisition and fulfillment
costs.
The Company recognize revenue when a customer
obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive
in exchange for such services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps:
1) Identify the contract(s) with a customer -
A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party’s rights
regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to those goods or services, (ii) the contract
has commercial substance and, (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods or services that are transferred
is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. We apply judgment in determining the customer’s
ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer’s historical payment experience or,
in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer. The contract term for contracts
that provide a right to terminate a contract for convenience without significant penalty will reflect the term that each party has enforceable
rights under the contract (the period through the earliest termination date). If the termination right is only provided to the customer,
the unsatisfied performance obligations will be evaluated as customer options as discussed below.
2) Identify the performance obligations in the
contract - Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the
customer that are both (i) capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together
with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and (ii) are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby
the transfer of the goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If these criteria are not met the
promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Certain of our contracts (under which we deliver multiple
promised services) require us to perform integration activities where we bear risk with respect to integration activities. Therefore,
we must apply judgment to determine whether as a result of those integration activities and risks, the promised services are distinct
on the context of the contract.
11
Table of Contents
We typically do not include options that would
result in a material right. If options to purchase additional services or options to renew are included in customer contracts, we evaluate
the option in order to determine if our arrangement include promises that may represent a material right and needs to be accounted for
as a performance obligation in the contract with the customer.
3) Determine the transaction price - The transaction
price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer.
Our contract prices may include fixed amounts, variable amounts or a combination of both fixed and variable amounts. To the extent the
transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction
price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the nature of the variable consideration.
When determining if variable consideration should be constrained, management considers whether there are factors outside our control that
could result in a significant reversal of revenue. In making these assessments, we consider the likelihood and magnitude of a potential
reversal of revenue. These estimates are re-assessed each reporting period as required.
4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract - If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the
single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price
to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets
the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance
obligation. For most performance obligations, we determine standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation
is sold separately. Although uncommon, if the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone
selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to
the performance obligations.
5) Recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a
performance obligation: we satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point-in-time as discussed in further detail below.
Revenue is recognized when the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a
customer.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the
Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”). ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions
and enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance in ASC 740. ASU 2019-12 was effective January 1, 2021.
The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.
In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01,
“Investments—Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives
and Hedging (Topic 815),” an amendment clarifying the interaction between accounting standards related to equity securities, equity
method investments, and certain derivative instruments. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020.
The Company adopted ASU 2020-01 effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-01 did not have any impact on its consolidated financial
statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt
— Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity
(Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU
2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt by eliminating the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models.
Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, convertible debt proceeds, unless issued with a substantial premium or an embedded conversion feature that
is not clearly and closely related to the host contract, will no longer be allocated between debt and equity components. This modification
will reduce the issue discount and result in less non-cash interest expense in financial statements. ASU 2020-06 also updates the earnings
per share calculation and requires entities to assume share settlement when the convertible debt can be settled in cash or shares. For
contracts in an entity’s own equity, the type of contracts primarily affected by ASU 2020-06 are freestanding and embedded features
that are accounted for as derivatives under the current guidance due to a failure to meet the settlement assessment by removing the requirements
to (i) consider whether the contract would be settled in registered shares, (ii) consider whether collateral is required to be posted,
and (iii) assess shareholder rights. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted,
but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and only if adopted as of the beginning of such fiscal year. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
12
Table of Contents
In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-10,
“Codification Improvements,” this ASU affects a wide variety of Topics in the Codification. They apply to all reporting entities
within the scope of the affected accounting guidance. More specifically, this ASU, among other things, contains amendments that improve
the consistency of the Codification by including all disclosure guidance in the appropriate Disclosure Section (Section 50). Many of the
amendments arose because the FASB provided an option to give certain information either on the face of the financial statements or in
the notes to financial statements and that option only was included in the Other Presentation Matters Section (Section 45) of the Codification.
The option to disclose information in the notes to financial statements should have been codified in the Disclosure Section as well as
the Other Presentation Matters Section (or other Section of the Codification in which the option to disclose in the notes to financial
statements appears). Those amendments are not expected to change current practice. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. Early application of the amendments
is permitted for and varies based on the entity. The amendments should be applied retrospectively and at the beginning of the period that
includes the adoption date. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings
Per Share (Topic 260), Debt — Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic
718), and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s Accounting for Certain
Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options (“ASU 2021-04”). ASU 2021-04 provides guidance
as to how an issuer should account for a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written
call option (i.e., a warrant) that remains classified after modification or exchange as an exchange of the original instrument for a new
instrument. An issuer should measure the effect of a modification or exchange as the difference between the fair value of the modified
or exchanged warrant and the fair value of that warrant immediately before modification or exchange and then apply a recognition model
that comprises four categories of transactions and the corresponding accounting treatment for each category (equity issuance, debt origination,
debt modification, and modifications unrelated to equity issuance and debt origination or modification). ASU 2021-04 is effective for
all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should
apply the guidance provided in ASU 2021-04 prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date. Early
adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity elects to early adopt ASU 2021- 04 in an
interim period, the guidance should be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The adoption
of ASU 2021-04 is not expected to have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.

(a) At the time of issuance, the Company evaluated the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature
(“BCF”) associated with the conversion feature of the convertible promissory note. The BCF was recorded into additional paid-in
capital. Additionally, the convertible promissory note was considered to have an embedded BCF because the effective conversion price was
less than the fair value of the Company’s common stock on notes issuance date. The value of the BCF was recorded as a discount on
the convertible promissory note. Hence, in connection with the issuance of the convertible promissory note, the Company recorded a total
debt discount of $400,000 that will be amortized over the term of the Note using effective interest rate method.

The diluted net loss per common share is the same

including stock options and warrants are anti-dilutive and are therefore excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per common

that the realization of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable. These tax losses do not expire under current

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including
the following “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. Such statements include, among others, those concerning our expected financial performance and strategic and operational
plans, as well as all assumptions, expectations, predictions, intentions or beliefs about future events. You are cautioned that any such
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that a number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results
of the Company to differ materially from those anticipated, expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. The words “believe”,
“expect”, “anticipate”, “project”, “targets”, “optimistic”, “intend”,
“aim”, “will” or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. All statements other
than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include risks related to our potential inability to raise additional
capital; changes in domestic and foreign laws, regulations and taxes; uncertainties related to China’s legal system and economic,
political and social events in China; Securities and Exchange Commission regulations which affect trading in the securities of “penny
stocks”; changes in economic conditions, including a general economic downturn or a downturn in the securities markets; and any
of the factors and risks mentioned in the “Risk Factors” sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended
December 31, 2021 and in Part 2, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q. The Company assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any forward-looking
statements, except as required by law.
COVID-19 Pandemic
In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 was
identified in China and was subsequently recognized as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (“WHO”) on March
11, 2020. Since that time, COVID-19 has spread around the world and throughout the United States, including in the regions and countries
in which we operate. Federal, state and local governments in the U.S and around the world have imposed restrictions on travel and business
operations and are advising or requiring individuals to limit or eliminate time outside of their homes. Temporary closures of businesses
have also been ordered in certain jurisdictions, and other businesses have temporarily closed voluntarily. These actions expanded significantly
in March and April of 2020 throughout the U.S. Consequently, the COVID-19 outbreak has severely restricted the level of economic activity
in the U.S. and around the world.
The outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing
numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as quarantines and shelter in place orders. These measures may remain in place for
a significant period of time and adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition as well as the business, operations
and financial conditions of our business partners. The spread of the virus has also caused us to modify our business practices (including
employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings) in ways that may be detrimental to our business (including
working remotely and its attendant cybersecurity risks). We may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that
we determine are in the best interests of our employees. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks
posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities.
There has been no material adverse impact on the
Company’s 2021 and 2022 results of operations to date. The effect of COVID-19 and related events, those not yet known or knowable,
could have a negative effect on the stock price, business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company, including
as a result of quarantines, market volatility, market downturns and business closures.
For the reasons discussed above, the Company cannot
reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact COVID-19 may have on the Company’s results of operations, financial
position, and liquidity. Notwithstanding any actions by national, state, and local governments to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 or by
the Company to address the adverse impacts of COVID-19, there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing activities will be successful
in mitigating or preventing significant adverse effects on the Company.

Net cash used in operating activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $187,110, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities amounting to $320,335 for

assets and projected revenues from our existing project will not be sufficient to fund operations over the next twelve months. This raises
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We intend to rely on the issuance of additional equity and debt securities
as well as on our note holders’ exercise of their conversion option to convert our notes to our common stock, in order to fund our
operations. However, it may be difficult for us to raise funds in the current economic environment. We cannot give assurance that we will
be able to generate sufficient revenue or raise new funds, and our note holders will exercise their conversion option before the note
is due. In any such case, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.

including in the regions and communities in which we operate. Federal, state and local governments in the U.S and around the world have
imposed restrictions on travel and business operations and are advising or requiring individuals to limit or eliminate time outside of
their homes. Temporary closures of businesses have also been ordered in certain jurisdictions, and other businesses have temporarily closed
voluntarily. These actions expanded significantly in March and April of 2020 throughout the U.S. Consequently, the COVID-19 outbreak has
severely restricted the level of economic activity in the U.S. and around the world.
The outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing
numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as quarantines and shelter in place orders. The spread of the virus has caused us
to modify our business practices (including employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings) in ways that
may be detrimental to our business (including working remotely and its attendant cybersecurity risks). We may take further actions as
may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees. There is no certainty that
such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities.
Our existing cash together with highly liquid
current assets are insufficient to fund the Company’s operations for the next twelve months. The Company will need to rely upon
some combination of cash generated from the Company’s operations, the proceeds from the potential exercise of the outstanding option
held by Keywin Holdings Limited (“Keywin”) to purchase $2 million in shares of the Company’s common stock, or proceeds
from the issuance of the Company’s equity and debt securities as well as the exercise of the conversion option by the Company’s
note holders to convert the notes to the Company’s common stock, in order to maintain the Company’s operations. However, it
may be difficult for us to raise funds in the current economic environment. If adequate capital is not available to us, our operations
and financial condition could be adversely impacted.
The effect of COVID-19 and related events, including
those described above and those not yet known or knowable, could have a negative effect on our stock price, business prospects, financial
condition, and results of operations.
