Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements December 31, 2022   NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS   Xenous Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on May 20, 1980 as Dayne Weiss and Associates, Inc. under the laws of the State of Utah.   On December 19, 2014, the Company completed a change of domicile merger with Concept Holding Corp., a Nevada corporation, which became the surviving entity.   On July 21, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company elected to file Articles of Merger with the Nevada SOS whereby it would enter into a statutory merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary, M101 Corp., a Nevada corporation, pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.200, et seq. The effect of such merger is the Company is the surviving entity and changed its name to “M101 Corp.” The merger took effect on August 14, 2017.
On November 2, 2019, a majority of shareholders approved a resolution to change the name of the Company to Xenous Holdings, Inc. On November 19, 2019, the Company received notice that the Secretary of State of Nevada accepted the Company’s Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Xenous Holdings, Inc. The Company currently has no business operations.    On November 11, 2022, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Dadvance Agarwood Alpha Sdn Bhd (“Dadvance”), a company primarily engaged in the plantations, inoculations, cultivations, manufacturing, marketing, trading and conducting research and development of agricultural commodities in relation to Aquilaria trees and its related products with their headquarter based in Malaysia. The Company will be conducting full financial and legal due diligence of Dadvance and, if the due diligence is satisfactory, negotiate the definite acquisition agreement with Dadvance and its shareholders. The Board of Directors will not proceed with the acquisition unless an independent fairness opinion regarding fairness of the acquisition is obtained. The Company engaged YYC Advisors, a Malaysian accounting and financial advisory to conduct independent valuation on the targeted Malaysia plantation company. The Company engaged Eastnaga Capital Fund Ltd as an advisor and manager for corporate strategy.   NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation   The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending March 31, 2023. The notes to the unaudited financial statements are condensed, as disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for fiscal year 2022 have been omitted. This report should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the footnotes thereto for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 included in the Company’s Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29, 2022.   Use of Estimates   The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with “GAAP,” which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   ASC 820 “ Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ” establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.   These tiers include:   Level 1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3: defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.     7 Table of Contents   The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of accounts payable and debts. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due to the short-term maturities and approximate market interest rates of these instruments.   Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share
The Company has adopted ASC Topic 260,
”Earnings per Share,” (“EPS”) which requires presentation of basic EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation. In the accompanying financial statements, basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any potentially dilutive securities.
Related Parties   We follow ASC 850,
“Related Party Disclosures,”
for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions (see Note 4).   COVID-19   In early 2020, the World Health Organization declared the rapidly spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. This pandemic has resulted in governments worldwide enacting emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus. The Company considered the impact of COVID-19 on the assumptions and estimates used and determined that there were no material adverse impacts on the Company’s results of operations and financial position at December 31, 2022. The full extent of the future impacts of COVID-19 on the Company’s operations is uncertain. A prolonged outbreak could have a material adverse impact on financial results and business operations of the Company in the future. The Company is
not
aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of its assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form
10 -Q. These estimates
may
change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance will be effective for entities for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new standard effective April 1, 2021 and there was no material impact on the Company’s financial statements.   Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. The Company’s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.    NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN   The Company has not yet generated any revenue since its inception and has an operating loss and net loss of $ 39,209
for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has accumulated deficit of $ 1,067,711 , negative operating cash flow of $ 48,010
and negative working capital of $ 756,911 . The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to execute its operation plan to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its major shareholders or other sources, as may be required. There can be no assurance that the necessary debt or equity financing will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to the Company.
8 Table of Contents   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient revenues in the future and in our ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect.
NOTE 4 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   Due to Related Party   During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Smartex Investment Ltd., the majority shareholder of the Company which is holding
82 % of the Company’s common shares, advanced $ 48,010
and $ 16,811 , respectively, to the Company for operating expenses. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, total amount due to Smartex Investment Ltd. was $ 747,627
and $ 699,617
respectively. The loan is non-interest bearing and due on demand.   NOTE 5 – SHARE CAPITAL   Preferred Stock   The Company is authorized to issue
10,000,000
shares of preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.001
per share. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, no preferred shares have been issued.   Common Stock   The Company is authorized to issue
10,000,000,000
shares of common stock with a par value of $ 0.001
per share.   There were no stock issuances during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company had
760,250,000
shares of common stock issued and outstanding.   NOTE 6 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   The due diligence process related to the acquisition plan with Dadvance Agarwood Alpha Sdn Bhd (“Dadvance”) is still in progress as at the date of this filing, and upon satisfactory only, the Company shall execute a separate share purchase agreement based on the valuation report.   In accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to December 31, 2022 to the date these financial statements were issued and has determined that it does not have other material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.     9 Table of Contents   ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   When used in this Quarterly Report, the words “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “continue,” “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operations, business strategy, operating results, and financial position. Persons reviewing this Quarterly Report are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those included within the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Such factors are discussed further below and also include general economic factors and conditions that may directly or indirectly impact our financial condition or results of operations.   Plan of Operation   Our plan of operation for the next 12 months is to: (i) consider guidelines of industries in which we may have an interest; (ii) adopt a business plan regarding engaging in the business of any selected industry; and (iii) to commence such operations through funding and/or the acquisition of a “going concern” engaged in any industry selected.   During the next 12 months, our only foreseeable cash requirements will relate to maintaining our good standing or the payment of expenses associated with legal fees, accounting fees and reviewing or investigating any potential business venture, which may be advanced by management or principal stockholders as loans to us. Because we have not determined any business or industry in which our operations will be commenced, and we have not identified any prospective venture as of the date of this Annual Report, it is impossible to predict the amount of any such loan. Any such loan will be on terms no less favorable to us than would be available from a commercial lender in an arm’s length transaction. No advance or loan from any affiliate will be required to be repaid as a condition to any agreement with future acquisition partners.     10 Table of Contents   Results of Operations   Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021         Three Months     Three Months             Ended     Ended             December 31,     December 31,             2022     2021     Changes                       Operating Expenses   $ 13,582     $ 13,644     $ (62 ) Net Loss   $ (13,582 )   $ (13,644 )   $ 62     We had no operations during the three months ended December 31, 2022 or 2021, nor do we have operations as of the date of this filing. We had a net loss of $13,582 and $13,644 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in general and administrative expense incurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021       Nine Months     Nine Months             Ended     Ended             December 31,     December 31,             2022     2021     Changes                       Operating Expenses   $ 39,209     $ 45,408     $ (6,199 ) Net Loss   $ (39,209 )   $ (45,408 )   $ 6,199     We had no operations during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 or 2021, nor do we have operations as of the date of this filing. We had a net loss of $39,209 and $45,408 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in professional fees incurred during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. Professional fees were $38,990 and $44,830 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.   Liquidity and Capital Resources       As of     As of             December 31,     March 31,             2022     2022     Changes                       Current Asset   $ -     $ 72     $ (72 ) Current Liabilities   $ 756,911     $ 717,774     $ 39,137   Working Capital (Deficiency)   $ (756,911 )   $ (717,702 )   $ (39,209 )     11 Table of Contents   As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, we had no current asset.   As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, our total liabilities were $756,911 and $717,774, respectively, which were current liabilities comprised of accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and related party advances.   Stockholders’ deficit was at $756,911 as of December 31, 2022 compared to deficit of $717,702 as of March 31, 2022.   We had no cash on hand as of December 31, 2022 or March 31, 2022 to meet ongoing expenses and debts that may accumulate. Accumulated deficit was at $1,067,711 as of December 31, 2022, compared to accumulated deficit of $1,028,502 as of March 31, 2022.   As of December 31, 2022, we had a working capital deficit of $756,911 compared with a working capital deficit of $717,702 as of March 31, 2022. The increase in working capital deficit was attributed to an increase in amount due to related party for advancement from the Company’s majority shareholder paying off vendors on behalf of the Company.
Nine Months     Nine Months             Ended     Ended             December 31,     December 31,             2022     2021     Changes                       Net cash used in operating activities   $ (48,010 )   $ (16,811 )   $ (31,199 ) Net cash provided by financing activities   $ 48,010     $ 16,811     $ 31,199   Net changes in cash and cash equivalents   $ -     $ -     $ -     Cash Flow from Operating Activities   We have not generated any positive cash flow from operating activities.   For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net cash flows used in operating activities was $48,010. The net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was attributed to a net loss of $39,209, increased by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $8,873 and decreased by a decrease in prepaid expense.   For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, net cash flows used in operating activities was $16,811. The net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 was attributed to a net loss of $45,408, decreased by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $28,597.   Cash Flow from Investing Activities   During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no investing activities.   Cash Flow from Financing Activities   We have financed our operations primarily from advances and loans from Smartex Investment Ltd., majority shareholder of the Company.   For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net cash from financing activities was $48,010 and $ 16,811, respectively.     12 Table of Contents   Going Concern   Our independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph to their audit issued in connection with the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022, relative to our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company, which has not generated any revenues, has incurred net losses, has nominal assets and a stockholders’ deficit. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
