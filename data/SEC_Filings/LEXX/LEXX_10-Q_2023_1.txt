28   Table of Contents   LEXARIA BIOSCIENCE CORP. NOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS November 30, 2022 (Expressed in U.S. Dollars)     1. Nature of Business   Lexaria Bioscience Corp. (“Lexaria”, “we”, “our” or the “Company”) is a biotechnology company pursuing the enhancement of the bioavailability of a diverse and broad range of active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) using our proprietary DehydraTECH drug delivery technology.   Revenues are generated from licensing contracts for the Company’s patented DehydraTECH technology based on the terms of use and defined geographic and licensing arrangements. We derive income from our third party contracted manufacturing of B2B DehydraTECH enhanced products made to customer specifications that are sold online and in-store in the US and Canada. We also perform contract services in R&D for customer specific formulations that are used in comparison testing to customers’ existing products.   Going Concern Consideration   The Company’s consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”) applicable to a going concern which assumes the Company will have sufficient funds to pay it operational, research and development and capital expenditures for a period of at least 12 months from the date this Report.   Since inception, the Company has incurred significant operating and net losses. The losses attributable to shareholders were $ 7.4 m, $ 4.2 m and $ 4.1 m for the years ended August 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of November 30, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $ 40.9 m. We expect to continue to incur significant operational expenses and net losses in the upcoming 12 months. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, depending on the stage and complexity of our R&D studies and corporate expenditures, additional revenues received from the licensing of our technology, if any, and the receipt of payments under any current or future collaborations we may enter into. The recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.   As of November 30, 2022, the Company had cash of approximately $4.5m and carries no significant debt other than amounts payable in the short term.
Also, on August 12, 2022, we entered into a sales agreement with Maxim Group LLC, (“Maxim”), pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate offering price of up to $5,925,000 under the At-The-Market (“ATM”) Offering. The sales agreement provides that Maxim will be entitled to a sales commission equal to 3.0% of the gross sales price per share of all shares sold under the ATM Offering. As of January 17, 2023 we have not sold any shares under the ATM Offering.   Based on our existing working capital and access to an ATM offering, as disclosed above management believes the Company has sufficient working capital to satisfy the Company’s estimated liquidity needs for the next 12 months. Because of the above factors, the Company believes that this alleviates the substantial doubt in connection with the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. However, there is no assurance that management’s plans will be successful due to the current economic climate in the United States and globally.   Page  7

28   Table of Contents   Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic   The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 continues to present uncertainty and unforecastable new risks to the Company and its business plans. As of November 30, 2022, there has been no material impact on the Company’s financial position as a direct result of the pandemic. However, the Company has experienced some supply chain disruptions and shortages in the timely procurement of ingredients and supplies used in both our R&D activities and B2B production. Management views this situation as transitory but cannot predict the length of time it may take for these disruptions to dissipate or if there will be a significant economic effect on the Company’s operations. In the interim, it may cause delays in carrying out our research studies and in our production schedules.   There may be further actions we must take that alter our operations, including those that may be required by federal, state, provincial, or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and other third parties with which we do business. We do not know when it will become practical to relax or eliminate some or all these measures entirely. The economic effect of a prolonged pandemic is difficult to predict and could result in material financial impact in the Company’s future reporting periods.   2. Significant Accounting Policies   The significant accounting policies of the Company are consistent with those of our audited financial statements on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022.   3. Basis of Consolidation   These interim consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries; Lexaria CanPharm ULC, Lexaria CanPharm Holdings Corp., PoViva Corp., Lexaria Hemp Corp., Kelowna Management Services Corp., and Lexaria Pharmaceutical Corp., and our
83.33 3% owned subsidiary Lexaria Nicotine LLC with the remaining
16.66 7% owned by Altria Ventures Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.   4. Basis of Presentation   The Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year or any subsequent period.   These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated annual financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022.   Page

28   Table of Contents   5. Recent Accounting Guidance   Pronouncements Issued but Not Yet Adopted   In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The FASB subsequently issued amendments to ASU 2016-13, which have the same effective date and transition date of January 1, 2023. These standards require that credit losses be reported using an expected losses model rather than the incurred losses model that is currently used, and establishes additional disclosures related to credit risks. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, these standards now require allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. These standards limit the amount of credit losses to be recognized for available-for-sale debt securities to the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value and requires the reversal of previously recognized credit losses if fair value increases. The Company does not currently expect the adoption of these standards to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.   6. Estimates and Judgments   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Some of the Company’s accounting policies require us to make subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. These accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. Although we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used. Changes in the accounting estimates used by the Company are reasonably likely to occur from time to time, which may have a material effect on the presentation of financial condition and results of operations.   The Company reviews these estimates, judgments, and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary. Although we believe that these estimates are reasonable actual results could differ.   In preparing these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the Company’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2022.   Page  9

Further, management cannot assess the impact of each factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.   Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (“US$”) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US GAAP”). The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report.   In this quarterly report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in US$. All references to “C$” refer to Canadian dollars and all references to “common shares” and “shares” refer to the common shares in our capital stock, unless otherwise indicated. The terms “Lexaria” “we”, “us”, “our” and “Company” mean the Company and/or our subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated.   The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed financial statements and accompanying notes in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and our audited financial statements with notes in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022.    Overview   Lexaria’s patented DehydraTECH technology improves the delivery of bioactive compounds while promoting healthy ingestion methods, lowers overall dosing, and is highly effective in active molecule delivery available in a range of formats from oral ingestible to oral buccal/sublingual to topical products. DehydraTECH substantially improves the rapidity and quantity of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“API”) transport to the blood plasma and brain using the body’s natural process for distributing fatty acids via the oral route. This technology extends across many categories beyond the primary pharmaceutical focus of the Company from foods and beverages to cosmetic products and nutraceuticals.   Page  17

28   Table of Contents   Lexaria is advancing several R&D activities in both preclinical and future clinical programs. Our primary focus during the current year is on our investigations of CBD for the reduction of hypertension. In fiscal 2022 we completed three human studies on hypertension with the results of our fourth and largest hypertension study to date continuing to be released throughout fiscal 2023. Preliminary results announced in October 2022   The FDA provided us with a positive written response from our pre-IND meeting regarding DehydraTECH-CBD for the treatment of hypertension. The FDA confirmed that it has agreed with Lexaria’s proposal to pursue a 505(b)(2) new drug application (“NDA”) regulatory pathway for our program. We continue working toward our IND filing which is anticipated to be in late fiscal 2023 or early 2024. During the year ended August 31, 2022, we also completed studies in NSAIDS, THC, PDE5s and nicotine.   The Company continues to engage in small R&D projects and B2B formulation for third parties who are evaluating our technology for use in their product.    Patents   Our current patent portfolio includes patent family applications or grants pertaining to our method of improving bioavailability and taste, and the use of DehydraTECH as a delivery platform for a wide variety of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“APIs”) including, but not limited to, fat soluble vitamins; anti-viral drugs; phosphodiesterase inhibitors; human hormones; regulated cannabinoids, and nicotine and its analogs.   We continue to pursue patent protection in more than 40 countries around the world as vigorously as we are able, since the successful granting of more of those applications could lead to material increases in shareholder value. The Company currently has over 50 patent applications pending worldwide .   The Company has patents issued in the United States, Australia, Europe, India, Mexico, and Japan.  On December 29, 2022, Lexaria was granted its first patent in Canada, marking our 28 th

28   Table of Contents   Research & Development   Lexaria is advancing several R&D activities in both preclinical and clinical programs. Currently, our primary research program is the investigation of cannabidiol (CBD) for the reduction of hypertension. Other programs include nicotine for oral pouches and nicotine replacement therapy, hormones, diabetes, dementia and others. From time to time the Company will engage in contract R&D for third parties who are interested in evaluating DehydraTECH in their products.   The FDA has provided a written response from our pre-IND meeting regarding DehydraTECH-CBD for the treatment of hypertension and has agreed with Lexaria’s proposal to pursue a 505(b)(2) new drug application (“NDA”) regulatory pathway for our program. We continue working toward our IND filing which is anticipated to be in late fiscal 2023 or early 2024.   During the quarter ended November 30, 2022, Lexaria incurred $829,489 (Nov 2021- $458,709) in R&D expenditures. Specific R&D programs are in ongoing development and align to our financial ability to undertake each research phase for each API. Due to our expanding portfolio coverage, we continually examine accelerated timetable options for testing, research, and development of each API. Fiscal 2023 continues to highlight the direction of our research and development programs with confirmatory results from our ongoing programs. We continue to  devote an increasing proportion of our resources and focus towards pharmaceutical applications.   The first results of our hypertension study HYPER-H21-4 were announced on October 27, 2022, with the primary safety and efficacy objectives being met. The study showed, among other things, a sustained drop in blood pressure in normally active hypertensive patients following multiple weeks of oral cannabidiol ("CBD") therapy, using Lexaria's patented DehydraTECH-CBD capsule formulation.
On December 21, further results were released from our multi-week human clinical hypertension study HYPER-H21-4, indicating superior cannabidiol ("CBD") blood absorption levels from our patented DehydraTECH-CBD™ relative to those of published, pharmaceutical-grade CBD industry comparators.   On November 1, 2022, the Company announced that independent review board ("IRB") approval has now been received for human clinical nicotine study NIC-H22-1. The study is a 36-person human pharmacokinetic ("pk") randomized, double blinded, cross-over study conducted in current cigarette smokers, wherein each person will visit the laboratory to be dosed three times over a period of weeks. During each visit only one oral nicotine pouch will be administered and evaluated: either DehydraTECH-nicotine; On!™ brand manufactured by Altria™; or Zyn™ brand manufactured by Swedish Match™. The study had earlier faced certain time extensions due to manufacturing and logistics, those issues have since been resolved. Initial dosing began on December 20, 2022.   Page

28   Table of Contents   On November 8 and 10, 2022 commencement of animal study programs DIAB-A22-1 and DEM-A22-1 were announced, designed to determine whether DehydraTECH-CBD may offer therapeutic utility against diabetes and dementia respectively.
On November 29, 2022 results from our animal study EPIL-A21-1 were released.  Study EPIL-A21-1 was designed to determine whether DehydraTECH-CBD could provide similar seizure inhibiting efficacy, using an established, vehicle-controlled, acute animal seizure model induced by electrical stimulation, at lower doses than were required with Epidiolex®. The study successfully demonstrated performance enhancements compared to Epidiolex as one of the world's leading anti-seizure medications. Epidiolex is currently the world's only commercially approved, CBD-powered anti-seizure drug.   Impact of COVID-19   The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present uncertainty and unforecastable new risks to the Company and its’ business plan.  To date, we have not experienced a material impact on our financial statements, impairments of any of our assets or any major business disruptions, including with our vendors.   We have made modifications to our normal operations including requiring team members to work remotely on a staggered basis. To the extent possible, we are conducting business as usual, with necessary or advisable modifications to employee travel.  At this time, these measures will continue in force for the near term.
We will continue to actively monitor the rapidly evolving situation related to COVID-19 and may take further actions that alter our operations, including those that may be required by federal, state, provincial, or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and other third parties with whom we do business. We do not know when, or if, it will become practical to relax or eliminate some or all these measures entirely.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
Critical Accounting Estimates   Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with US GAAP. These accounting principles require management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses during the periods reported. Based on information available to management at the time, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are considered reasonable. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates, judgments and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financials.  For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, please read
Note 4. Estimates and Judgements
as found in the financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022.  There have been no material changes to the critical accounting estimates as previously disclosed in our 2022 10-K.   Page

28   Table of Contents   Capital Assets   Capital assets, consisting of property and equipment  are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated using the straight-line method over their useful lives or otherwise by units of production.
Patents   Capitalized patent costs represent legal costs incurred to establish US patents. All other patent costs are expensed as incurred. When US patents reach a mature stage, any associated legal costs are typically maintenance fees and therefore expensed as incurred. Capitalized patent costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the patent. In the period ended November 30, 2022, the Company recognized $2,255 in amortization attributable to capitalized patents.
Revenue Recognition   Licensing revenue from intellectual property   Our revenues from licenses that grant the right to access our intellectual property, which we consider symbolic licenses of IP, are recognized over time following the transfer and use of our patented infusion technology DehydraTECH . Royalty revenues are recognized in the period in which our licensees sell the related products, which in certain cases may require us to estimate our royalty revenue.   Usage fees from intellectual property   We recognize usage fees from B2B clients in the period in which the counterparty completes the manufacturing of products which incorporate DehydraTECH enabled APIs. We generally recognize revenue when we have satisfied all contractual obligations and are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable. We are often entitled to bill our customers and receive payment from our customers in advance of recognizing the revenue.   Product revenue   We generally recognize revenue when we have satisfied all contractual obligations and are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable. We are often entitled to bill our customers and receive payment from our customers in advance of recognizing the revenue.
Cost of sales   Cost of sales includes all expenditures incurred in bringing the goods to the point of sale This includes third-party manufacturing and handling costs, direct costs of the raw material, inbound freight charges, warehousing costs, and applicable overhead expenses.
Funding Requirements   We anticipate that our expenditures will increase in connection with our ongoing R&D program, specifically with respect to our animal and human clinical trials of our DehydraTECH formulations for the purposes of treating hypertension, dementia and diabetes.  As we move forward with our Investigational New Drug application with the FDA, we anticipate that our expenditures will further increase and accordingly, we expect to incur increased operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future.   Page  21
of
28   Table of Contents   Through November 30, 2022, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of our common stock.  The Company has consistently incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations, including net losses of $1,769,306 and $2,003,482 for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The continuation of Lexaria as a going concern depends on raising additional capital and/or attaining and maintaining profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recovery and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should our Company discontinue operations.  The recurring losses from operations and net negative cash flows from operation raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.. As of the issuance date of these consolidated interim financial statements, we expect our positive working capital of approximately $5.07m as at November 30, 2022 will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the forthcoming 12 months from the issuance date of this report.   On August 12, 2022, we entered into a sales agreement with Maxim Group LLC, (“Maxim”), pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate offering price of up to $5,925,000 under the At-The-Market (“ATM”) Offering. The sales agreement provides that Maxim will be entitled to a sales commission equal to 3.0% of the gross sales price per share of all shares sold under the ATM Offering. As of January 17, 2023 we have not sold any shares under the ATM Offering.
Based on our existing working capital and access to an ATM offering, as disclosed above, management’s plans to improve cash flows, as disclosed above management believes the Company has sufficient working capital to satisfy the Company’s estimated liquidity needs for the next 12 months. Because of the above factors, the Company believes that this alleviates the substantial doubt in connection with the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. However, there is no assurance that management’s plans will be successful due to the current economic climate in the United States and globally.   Results of Operations for our Period Ended November 30, 2022, and 2021   Our net loss and comprehensive loss for the three months ended and the changes between those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows:   Three Months Ended   November 30,     November 30,             2022     2021     Change       $     $     $   Revenue     101,476       13,880       87,596   Research and development     829,489       458,709       370,780   Consulting fees & salaries     321,074       738,111       (417,037 ) Legal and professional     94,482       141,607       (47,125 ) Other general and administrative

Previous year expenditures were higher due to increased patent and trademark filings, higher accounting fees and the utilization of additional advisory services.

This difference was largely due to decreased stock-based compensation ($69k vs $409k) unrealized losses on marketable securities ($78k vs $340k) and a reduction in prepaid expense balance in the quarter of $316k vs $82k in the prior year.

28   Table of Contents   Investing Activities   Net cash from investing activities decreased by $23k over 2022 due to decreased spending on acquisitions of equipment.    Financing Activities   The change in net cash provided from financing activities was immaterial.
Liquidity and Capital Resources   We have incurred net losses of approximately $7.4m and $4.2m respectively in the past two fiscal years. We expect to continue to incur significant operational expenses and net losses in the upcoming 12 months and beyond. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, depending on the stage and complexity of our R&D studies and related expenditures, the receipt of additional payments on the licencing of our technology, if any, and the receipt of payments under any current or future collaborations we may enter into.   As the Company continues with our IND application process and progresses into the clinical development of our initial product candidate, the need for substantial capital resources increases. Our existing cash will not be sufficient to complete the full development, testing and commercialization of an FDA approved product candidate. To achieve this objective, we will require substantial funding.
On August 12, 2022, we entered into a sales agreement with Maxim Group LLC, (“Maxim”), pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate offering price of up to $5,925,000 under the At-The-Market Offering (“ATM”). The sales agreement provides that Maxim will be entitled to a sales commission equal to 3.0% of the gross sales price per share of all shares sold under the ATM. As of January 17, 2022 no shares have been sold under the ATM.   We may also offer securities in response to market conditions or other circumstances if we believe such a plan of financing is required to advance the Company’s business plans. There is no certainty that future equity or debt financing will be available or that it will be at acceptable terms and the outcome of these matters is unpredictable. A lack of  adequate funding may force us to reduce spending, curtail or suspend planned programs or possibly liquidate assets.  Any of these actions could adversely and materially affect our business, cash flow, financial condition, results of operations, and potential prospects. The sale of additional equity may result in additional dilution to our stockholders. Entering into additional licencing agreements, collaborations, partnerships, alliances marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties to increase our capital resources is also possible. If we do so we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favourable to us.   The Company has evaluated whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. As of November 30, 2022, the Company had cash on hand of approximately $4.5m to settle $281k in current liabilities. The Company believes this and our access to an ATM offering are sufficient to fund our expected R&D and operating expenditures for twelve months following the date of filing this report. We do not anticipate making any material capital expenditures in the fiscal 2023 as we believe our current facilities and equipment are sufficient for the forthcoming twelve months following the date of filing this report.   Page  24

28   Table of Contents   Item 3. Controls and Procedures   Management’s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of November 30, 2022, the fiscal quarter covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of November 30, 2022.   Inherent limitations on Effectiveness of Controls   Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, regulations, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human error. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   During the quarter ended November 30, 2022, our controls and controls processes remained consistent with August 31, 2022. There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended November 30, 2022, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.   Our control processes are designed to include remote workers. The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our internal controls over financial reporting other than increasing requirements for social distancing and some additional remote working requirements for staff.
Change of Auditors   Davidson & Company LLP advised Lexaria Bioscience Corp. that it would not stand for re-election as the Registrant’s Certifying Accountant (Auditor) for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023. Subsequent to the year ended August 31, 2022 the company appointed MaloneBailey LLP as our new Auditors.
