Table of Contents ​ CYTODYN INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Note 1. Organization CytoDyn Inc. (together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, the “Company”) was originally incorporated under the laws of Colorado on May 2, 2002, under the name RexRay Corporation and, effective August 27, 2015, reincorporated under the laws of Delaware. The Company is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the clinical development of innovative treatments for multiple therapeutic indications based on its product candidate, leronlimab (PRO 140), a novel humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the CCR5 receptor. The Company has been engaged in studying leronlimab for use in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), and solid tumors in oncology.
The Company has been investigating leronlimab as a viral entry inhibitor for HIV, believed to competitively bind to the N-terminus and second extracellular loop of the CCR5 receptor. For immunology, the CCR5 receptor is believed to be implicated in immune-mediated illnesses such as NASH. The CCR5 receptor may also be present on cells that undergo malignant transformation and may also be present in the tumor microenvironment. Leronlimab is being studied in NASH, NASH-HIV, solid tumors in oncology, and other HIV indications where CCR5 is believed to play an integral role. ​ The Company is pursuing the regulatory approval of leronlimab in hopes that commercial sales will be obtained for one or more indications. The Company previously submitted a Biologic License Application (“BLA”) for leronlimab as a combination therapy with highly active antiretroviral therapy (“HAART”) for highly treatment-experienced HIV patients. In July 2020, the Company received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding its BLA submission. The FDA informed the Company that the BLA did not contain certain information and data needed to complete a substantive review and therefore, the FDA would not file the BLA. In November 2021, the Company resubmitted the non-clinical and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (“CMC”) sections of the BLA.
As previously reported and as described in Note 9,
Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings , the Company encountered difficulties in obtaining the clinical data from its trials in the detail and format requested by the FDA in discussions with the Company in connection with its efforts to resubmit the BLA. The Company is engaged in litigation with its former contract research organization (“CRO”), which was responsible for gathering the required data. In the context of the litigation, the Company obtained an order requiring the CRO to release the Company’s clinical data related to the BLA and other clinical trials, which the CRO had been withholding. Further, the order granted the Company the right to perform an audit of the CRO’s services, which has been completed.
Additionally, in March 2022, the FDA placed the Company’s HIV trials on a partial clinical hold. In October 2022, the Company voluntarily withdrew its BLA submission after concluding that a significant risk existed that the BLA would not receive FDA approval due to the CRO's inadequate process and performance around the monitoring and oversight of the clinical data.
​ The Company’s efforts are currently directed toward obtaining removal of the clinical hold.

The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire fiscal year or for any other future annual or interim period. Reclassifications Certain prior year and prior quarter amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Such reclassifications did not have material effect on the Company’s previously reported financial position, results of operations, stockholders’ deficit, or net cash provided by operating activities. During the quarter ended August 31, 2022, the Company reclassified amounts recorded as accumulated dividends for Series C and D preferred stockholders from accumulated deficit to additional paid-in capital. These reclassifications were made to reflect the proper presentation for accrued dividends when an entity has accumulated deficit.
Revision and Restatement of Financial Statements
During the preparation of the quarterly financial statements as of and for the period ended November 30, 2021, the Company identified an error in how non-cash inducement interest expense was calculated in previous reporting periods dating back to fiscal year 2018. The error resulted in an understatement of non-cash inducement interest expense and additional paid-in capital. For details, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revision of Financial Statements in the 2022 Form 10-K. Also, during the preparation and audit of the annual financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, the Company concluded that a material error was identified in how the Company was accounting for common stock issued to settle certain convertible note obligations dating back to fiscal year 2021. For details, refer to Note 14, Restatement in the 2022 Form 10-K. Neither of the errors had impact on operating loss, cash, net cash used in or provided by operating, financing, and investing activities, assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies, total stockholders’ deficit, number of shares issued and outstanding, basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, and number of shares available for future issuance for any period presented, and are reflected in the accompanying statement of operations, changes in stockholders’ deficit, and statement of cash flows. Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had losses for all periods presented. The Company incurred a net loss of approximately $ 47.5
million for the six months ended November 30, 2022 and has an accumulated deficit of approximately $ 809.4  million as of November 30, 2022. These factors, among several others, including the various legal matters discussed in Note 9,
Commitments and Contingencies – Legal Proceedings , raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
The Company’s continuance as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional operating capital, complete the development of its product candidate, leronlimab, obtain approval to commercialize leronlimab from regulatory agencies, continue to outsource manufacturing of leronlimab, and ultimately achieve revenues and attain profitability. The Company plans to continue to engage in research and development activities related to leronlimab for multiple indications and expects to incur significant research and development expenses in the future, primarily related to its regulatory compliance, including seeking the lifting of the FDA’s clinical hold with regard to the Company’s HIV program, performing additional clinical trials, and seeking regulatory approval for its product candidate for commercialization. These research and development activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. The Company intends to finance its future development activities and its working capital needs primarily from the sale of equity and debt securities, combined with additional funding from other sources. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these endeavors. 9
Table of Contents ​ Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information, such as the status of our analysis of the results of our clinical trials and/or discussions with the FDA which could have an impact on the Company’s significant accounting estimates and assumptions. The Company’s estimates are based on historical experience and on various market and other relevant, appropriate assumptions. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, those relating to capitalization of pre-launch inventories, charges for excess and obsolete inventories, research and development expenses, commitments and contingencies, stock-based compensation, and the assumptions used to value warrants and warrant modifications. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Pre-launch Inventories Pre-launch inventories were comprised of raw materials required to commercially produce leronlimab and substantially completed commercially produced leronlimab in anticipation of commercial sales of the product upon potential regulatory approval as a combination therapy for HIV patients in the United States. The Company’s pre-launch inventories consisted of (1) raw materials purchased for commercial production, (2) work-in-progress materials which consisted of bulk drug substance, which was the manufactured drug stored in bulk storage, and (3) drug product, which was the manufactured drug in unlabeled vials. The consumption of raw materials during production was classified as work-in-progress until saleable. Once it is determined to be in saleable condition, following regulatory approval, inventory is classified as finished goods.
The Company capitalizes inventories procured or produced in preparation for product launches. Typically, capitalization of such inventory begins when the results of clinical trials have reached a status sufficient to support regulatory approval, uncertainties regarding ultimate regulatory approval have been significantly reduced, and the Company has determined it is probable that these capitalized costs will provide future economic benefit in excess of capitalized costs. The material factors considered by the Company in evaluating these uncertainties include the receipt and analysis of positive Phase 3 clinical trial results for the underlying product candidate, results from meetings with the relevant regulatory authorities prior to the filing of regulatory applications, and status of the Company’s regulatory applications. The Company closely monitors the status of the product within the regulatory review and approval process, including all relevant communications with regulatory authorities. If the Company becomes aware of any specific material risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory review and approval process or if there are any specific issues identified relating to safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling, it may make a determination that the related inventory no longer qualifies for capitalization.
The Company determines whether raw materials purchased for commercial production are usable for production based on the manufacturer’s assigned expiration date. In evaluating whether raw materials included in the pre-launch inventories will be usable for production, the Company takes into account the shelf-life of raw materials at the time they are expected to be used in manufacturing. Any raw materials past expiration date at the time of the next manufacturing run are removed from inventory.
As one stage of the manufacturing process, the Company produces work-in-progress materials which consist of bulk drug substance, which is the manufactured drug stored in bulk storage. The initial shelf-life of bulk drug substance is established based on prior experience and periodically performed stability studies and is set at
four years
from the date of manufacturing. Bulk drug substance is subject to deep freeze storage, and stability studies are performed on a periodic basis in accordance with the established stability protocols. If drug substance meets suitability criteria beyond the initial shelf-life, its shelf-life may be extended based on prior experience and stability trend analysis, and during the extension period periodic stability testing is performed on the drug substance. Regardless of the number of stability studies performed, if drug substance continues to meet prespecified suitability parameters it may be used in manufacturing; if
10
Table of Contents drug substance fails to meet suitability criteria beyond its assigned shelf-life at that time, it may no longer be used and is considered to be expired.
The Company utilizes resins, a reusable raw material, in its bulk drug manufacturing process. Shelf-life of a resin used in commercial manufacturing of biologics is determined by the number of cycles for which it has been validated to be used in a manufacturing process before it is considered unusable. Unpacked and unused resins have a manufacturer’s expiration date by which resins are expected to start being used in the manufacturing process without loss of their properties. Prior to a new manufacturing campaign, and between manufacturing campaigns, the resins are removed from storage, and are treated and tested for suitability. Once resins are used in the manufacturing process, their shelf-life is measured by a validated predetermined number of manufacturing cycles they are usable for, conditional on appropriate storage solution under controlled environment between production campaigns, as well as by performing pre-production usability testing. Before a manufacturing campaign, each resin is tested for suitability. Regardless of the number of cycles, if a resin fails to meet prespecified suitability parameters it may not be used in manufacturing; likewise, even if the resin meets suitability criteria beyond the lifetime cycles, it may no longer be used. The cost of the resins used in a manufacturing campaign is allocated to the cost of the drug product in vials.
The Company values its inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the average cost method. Inventory is evaluated for recoverability by considering the likelihood that revenue will be obtained from the future sale of the related inventory considering the status of the product within the regulatory approval process. The Company evaluates its inventory levels on a quarterly basis and writes down inventory that became obsolete, has a cost in excess of its expected net realizable value, or is in quantities in excess of expected requirements. In assessing the lower of cost or net realizable value for pre-launch inventory, the Company relies on independent analyses provided by third parties knowledgeable about the range of likely commercial prices comparable to current comparable commercial product. Quarterly, the Company also evaluates whether certain raw materials held in its inventory are expected to reach the end of their estimated shelf-lives based on passage of time, the number of manufacturing cycles they are used in and results of pre-production testing prior to the expected production date, or when resins used in the manufacturing process fail suitability tests. If any of such events occur, the Company may make a determination to record a charge if it is expected that such inventories will become obsolete prior to the expected production date.
Anticipated future sales, shelf lives, and expected approval date are considered when evaluating realizability of capitalized inventory. The shelf-life of a product is determined as part of the regulatory approval process; however, in assessing whether to capitalize pre-launch inventories, the Company considers the product stability data for all of the pre-approval inventory procured or produced to date to determine whether there is adequate shelf-life. When the remaining shelf-life of drug product inventory is less than 12 months, it is likely that it will not be accepted by potential customers. However, as inventories approach their shelf-life expiration, the Company may perform additional stability testing to determine if the inventory is still viable, which can result in an extension of its shelf-life and revaluation of the need for and the amount of the previously recorded reserves. Further, in addition to performing additional stability testing, certain raw materials inventory may be sold in its then current condition prior to reaching expiration. If the Company determines that it is not likely that shelf-life may be extended or the inventory cannot be sold prior to expiration, the Company may record a charge to bring inventory to its net realizable value.
In October 2022, the Company voluntarily withdrew its BLA submission after concluding that a significant risk existed that the BLA would not receive FDA approval due to the inadequate process and performance by its former CRO around the monitoring and oversight of the clinical data from its trials.
Following this decision, none of the Company’s inventories now qualify for capitalization as pre-launch inventories.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
in the 2022 Form 10-K. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06,
Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)
and
Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) , which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments. The guidance removes certain accounting models that separate the embedded conversion features from the host contract for convertible instruments. Either a modified retrospective method of transition or a fully
11
Table of Contents retrospective method of transition is permissible for the adoption of this standard. Update No. 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU No. 2020-06 as of June 1, 2022, using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of ASU No. 2020-06 had no impact on the Company’s balance sheets, statements of operations, cash flows or financials statement disclosures. In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-04,
Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options . ASU 2021-04 addresses the accounting for certain modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (e.g., warrants). Entities should treat a modification of the terms or conditions, or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity-classified after modification or exchange, as an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument. Guidance should be applied prospectively after the date of initial application. ASU 2021-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
The Company adopted the new guidance prospectively as of June 1, 2022 and used the framework to record a modification to equity classified warrants during the six months ended November 30, 2022. The modification to equity instruments, consisting of a trigger of a down round provision was recorded as a deemed dividend in accordance with this guidance, resulting in an approximate $ 4.2
million charge to additional paid-in capital, induced warrant exercises recorded as $ 2.1
million issuance cost and $ 0.5
million deemed dividend, and the extension of warrant expiration dates recorded as a $ 0.5
million deemed dividend. The deemed dividends were included in the loss per share calculation; refer to Note 7 , Loss per Common Share . Refer to Note 6 , Equity Awards and Warrants

- ​ During the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company reviewed purchase commitments made by its manufacturing partner, Samsung BioLogics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”), under the master agreement between the Company and Samsung, and its vendors for specialized raw materials for which the Company made a prepayment in the amount of
12
Table of Contents $ 2.7
million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, which were recorded as prepaid expenses in the consolidated financial statements as of May 31, 2022.
As discussed in Note 9,
Commitments and Contingencies – Commitments with Samsung BioLogics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”) , t he Company and its manufacturing partner remain in ongoing discussions about, among other things, deferring the unfulfilled commitments. These additional specialized raw materials are estimated to have shelf-lives ranging from 2023 to 2026. The entire amount was charged-off as of August 31, 2022. In October 2022, the Company voluntarily withdrew its rolling BLA submission after concluding that a significant risk existed that the BLA would not receive FDA approval due to the inadequate process and performance by its former CRO around the monitoring and oversight of the clinical data from its trials.
Following this decision, none of the Company’s inventories now qualify for capitalization as pre-launch inventories.
For the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company charged-off the remaining raw material resin and work-in-progress bulk product inventories of approximately
$ 16.3

3,926 ​ Under the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), dividends on its outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B preferred stock”) may be paid in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock at the option of the Company. Dividends on outstanding shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series C preferred stock”) and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series D preferred stock”) are payable in cash or shares of common stock at the election of the
13
Table of Contents holder. The preferred stockholders have the right to dividends only when and if declared by the Company’s Board of Directors. Under Section 170 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Company is permitted to pay dividends only out of capital surplus or, if none, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared or net profits from the preceding fiscal year.
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock Each share of the Series B preferred stock is convertible into
ten
shares of the Company’s common stock. Dividends are cumulative and payable to the Series B preferred stockholders when and as declared by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). Dividends on the Series B preferred stock accumulate at the rate of $ 0.25
per share per annum, and may be paid, at the option of the Company at the time of conversion, either in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $ 0.50
per share. The Series B preferred stock has liquidation preferences over the common shares at $ 5.00
per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Except as provided by law, the Series B preferred stockholders have no voting rights. The Company does not accrue dividends on Series B preferred stock until such dividends are declared. Series C and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock The Series C and Series D Certificates of Designation provide, among other things, that holders of Series C and Series D preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board and out of any assets at the time legally available therefor, cumulative dividends at the rate of ten percent ( 10 %) per share per annum of the stated value of the Series C and Series D preferred stock, which is $ 1,000
per share (the “Stated Value”). Dividends on the Series C and Series D preferred stock are cumulative, and will accrue and be compounded annually, whether or not declared and whether or not there are any profits, surplus or other funds or assets of the Company legally available therefor. Dividends on the Series C and Series D preferred stock may be paid in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock at the option of the holder. Series C and Series D preferred stock does not have redemption rights. Each share of Series C and Series D preferred stock is convertible at the holder’s option into shares of common stock, with Series C stockholders having conversion price of $ 0.50
per share, and Series D stockholders having conversion price of $ 0.80
per share, together with accrued and unpaid dividends payable, at the option of the holder, in cash or shares of common stock based on the conversion price. Given the obligation to settle all dividends, including those in arrears, in cash at the election of the preferred stockholder upon conversion, whether or not declared by the Company, the Company accrues dividends on Series C and D preferred stock as a liability in its consolidated financial statements. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of Series D preferred stock will be entitled to receive, on a pari passu basis with the holders of the Series C preferred stock and in preference to any payment or distribution to holders of the Series B preferred stock and common stock, an amount per share equal to the Stated Value plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends. If, at any time while the Series C and Series D preferred stock is outstanding, the Company effects any reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company, sale of substantially all of its assets, or other specified transaction (each, as defined in the Series C and the Series D Certificates of Designation, a “Fundamental Transaction”), a holder of Series C and Series D preferred stock will have the right to receive any shares of the acquiring corporation or other consideration it would have been entitled to receive if it had been a holder of the number of shares of common stock then issuable upon conversion in full of the Series C and Series D preferred stock immediately prior to the Fundamental Transaction. Except as otherwise provided in the Series C and Series D Certificates of Designation or as otherwise required by law, the Series C and Series D preferred stock have no voting rights. ​ 14

45,210 ​ Long-term Convertible Note – April 2, 2021 Note On April 2, 2021, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company issued a secured convertible promissory note with a
two-year
term in the initial principal amount of $ 28.5
million (the “April 2, 2021 Note”). The Company received consideration of $ 25.0
million, reflecting an original issue discount of $ 3.4
million and issuance costs of $ 0.1
million. Interest accrues at an annual rate of
10 % on the outstanding balance, with the rate increasing to the lesser of
22 % per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law upon occurrence of an event of default. In addition, upon any event of default, the investor may accelerate the outstanding balance payable under the April 2, 2021 Note; upon such acceleration, the outstanding balance will increase automatically by
15 %,
10 % or
5 %, depending on the nature of the event of default. The events of default are listed in Section 4 of the April 2, 2021 Note filed as
Exhibit 4.1
to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 8, 2021. The April 2, 2021 Note is secured by all the assets of the Company, excluding the Company’s intellectual property.
Pursuant to the terms of the April 2, 2021 Note, the Company must obtain the investor’s consent before assuming additional debt with aggregate net proceeds to the Company of less than
$ 50.0
million. In the event of any such approval, the outstanding principal balance of the April 2, 2021 Note will increase automatically by
5 %
upon the issuance of such additional debt .
The investor may convert all or any part the outstanding balance of the April 2, 2021 note into shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of
$ 10.00
per share upon
five
trading days’ notice, subject to certain adjustments and volume and ownership limitations. In addition to standard anti-dilution adjustments, the conversion price of the April 2, 2021 Note is subject to full-ratchet anti-dilution protection, pursuant to which the conversion price will be automatically reduced to equal the effective price per share in any new offering by the Company of equity securities that have registration rights, are registered or become registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The April 2, 2021 Note provides for liquidated damages upon failure to deliver common stock within specified timeframes and requires the Company to maintain a share reservation of
6.0
million shares of common stock. The investor may redeem any portion of the note, at any time beginning
six months
after the issue date upon
three
trading days’ notice, subject to a maximum monthly redemption amount of
$ 3.5
million. The April 2, 2021 Note requires the Company to satisfy its redemption obligations in cash within
three
trading days of the Company’s receipt of such notice. The Company may prepay the outstanding balance of the note, in part or in full, plus a
15 %
premium, at any time upon
15
trading days’ notice.

Table of Contents Pursuant to the terms of the April 2, 2021 Note, the Company is obligated, at the discretion of the noteholder, to reduce the outstanding balance by $ 7.5
million per month for
five months . During fiscal year 2022, in partial satisfaction of debt reduction amounts, the Company and the April 2, 2021 Note holder entered into exchange agreements, pursuant to which the April 2, 2021 Note was partitioned into new notes (the “Partitioned Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of $ 18.7
million, which were exchanged concurrently with the issuance of approximately
25.3
million shares of common stock. The outstanding balance of the April 2, 2021 Note was reduced by the Partitioned Notes to a principal amount of $ 9.8
million. The Company accounted for the restructured partitioned notes and exchange settlements as induced conversion, and, accordingly, recorded an aggregate loss on convertible debt induced conversion of $ 18.8
million through May 31, 2022. During the three months ended November 30, 2022, in satisfaction of a redemption, the Company and the April 2, 2021 Note holder entered into an exchange agreement, pursuant to which the April 2, 2021 Note was partitioned into a new note (the “November Partitioned Note”) with a principal amount of $ 0.5
million, which was exchanged concurrently with the issuance of approximately
1.8
million shares of common stock. The outstanding balance of the April 2, 2021 Note was reduced by the November Partitioned Note to a principal amount of $ 9.3
million. The Company accounted for the November Partitioned Note and exchange settlement as an induced conversion, and, accordingly, recorded a non-cash loss on convertible debt induced conversion of $ 0.6
million for the three months ended November 30, 2022. For the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $ 0.6
million and $ 6.8
million, respectively, in loss on convertible debt induced conversion.
​ Long-term Convertible Note – April 23, 2021 Note On April 23, 2021, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company issued a secured convertible promissory note with a
two-year
term to an institutional accredited investor affiliated with the holder of the April 2, 2021 Note in the initial principal amount of $ 28.5
million (the “April 23, 2021 Note”). The Company received consideration of $ 25.0
million, reflecting an original issue discount of $ 3.4
million and issuance costs of $ 0.1
million. Interest accrues at an annual rate of
10 % on the outstanding balance of the April 23, 2021 Note, with the rate increasing to the lesser of
22 % per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law upon the occurrence of an event of default. In addition, upon any event of default, the investor may accelerate the outstanding balance payable under the April 23, 2021 Note; upon such acceleration, the outstanding balance will increase automatically by
15 %,
10 % or
5 %, depending on the nature of the event of default. The events of default are listed in Section 4 of the April 23, 2021 Note filed as
Exhibit 4.1
to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 29, 2021. The April 23, 2021 Note is secured by all the assets of the Company, excluding the Company’s intellectual property.
Pursuant to the terms of the April 23, 2021 Note, the Company must obtain the investor’s consent before assuming additional debt with aggregate net proceeds to the Company of less than $ 75.0
million. In the event of any such approval, the outstanding principal balance of the April 23, 2021 Note will increase automatically by
5 % upon the issuance of such additional debt. The investor may convert all or any part of the outstanding balance into shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of $ 10.00
per share upon
five
trading days’ notice, subject to certain adjustments and volume and ownership limitations specified in the April 23, 2021 Note. In addition to standard anti-dilution adjustments, the conversion price of the April 23, 2021 Note is subject to full-ratchet anti-dilution protection, pursuant to which the conversion price will be automatically reduced to equal the effective price per share in any new offering by the Company of equity securities that have registration rights, are registered or become registered under the Securities Act. The April 23, 2021 Note provides for liquidated damages upon failure to deliver common stock within specified timeframes and requires the Company to maintain a share reservation of
6.0
million shares of common stock. The investor may redeem any portion of the April 23, 2021 Note, at any time beginning
six months
after the issue date, upon
three
trading days’ notice, subject to a maximum monthly redemption amount of $ 7.0
million. The April 23, 2021 Note requires the Company to satisfy its redemption obligations in cash within
three
trading days of the Company’s receipt of such notice. The Company may prepay the outstanding balance of the April 23, 2021 Note, in part or in full, plus a
15 % premium, at any time upon
15
trading days’ notice. The holders of the April 2 and April 23 Notes waived provisions in the notes that could have triggered the imposition of a default interest rate, a downward adjustment of the conversion price, or specified other provisions relating to default, breach or imposition of a penalty. The related events included the grant of registration rights to
16
Table of Contents investors in specified private offerings, the issuance of warrants to purchase up to
45
million shares of common stock with registration rights to certain parties and potential incurrence of debt pursuant to a Surety Bond Backstop Agreement, and the grant of a security interest in the Company’s intellectual property to certain parties to the Surety Bond Backstop Agreement. Refer to Note 6,
Equity Awards and Warrants . ​ Note 6. Equity Awards and Warrants Approval of Increase in Authorized Common Stock On August 31, 2022, at a special stockholders’ meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved a proposal to increase the total number of authorized shares of common stock from
1.0
billion shares to
1.35
billion shares. Liability Classified Warrants ​ From June 24, 2022 through August 31, 2022, the Company had insufficient authorized common stock to reserve for the shares underlying the Surety Backstop warrants and warrants issued to a placement agent in connection with the June 2022 offering (Refer to
Private Placement of Warrants under Surety Bond Backstop Agreement
and
Private Placement of Common Stock and Warrants through Placement Agent
sections below.) After approval by the Company’s stockholders of an increase to the Company’s authorized common stock, on August 31, 2022, sufficient shares were authorized to cover the shares underlying the warrants. Given that the Company did not have a sufficient number of authorized shares for the instruments at the time they were issued, the Company accounted for such warrants issued from June 24, 2022 through August 2022 as liability classified warrants consistent with ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging.
In accordance with the prescribed accounting guidance, the Company measured fair value of liability classified warrants using fair value hierarchy which include: Level 1.
Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2.
Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions.
Level 3.
Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. These Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that the Company was unable to corroborate with observable market data.
As of August 31, 2022, in accordance with ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging,
the Company reclassified the warrants to equity upon the increase in the Company’s authorized common stock. The Company recorded a loss on derivatives of approximately $ 8.6
million in the quarter ended August 31, 2022 due to change in fair market value of the liability classified warrants between June 24 and August 31, 2022. The table below presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for liabilities measured at fair value as of May 31, 2022, and during the three months ended August 31, 2022: ​ ​ ​ ​ 17

— ​ The Company used a Black Scholes valuation model to estimate the value of the liability classified warrants using assumptions presented in the table below. The Black Scholes valuation model was used because management believes it reflects all the assumptions that market participants would likely consider in negotiating the transfer of the warrant. The Company’s derivative liability is classified within Level 3.

​ Equity Incentive Plan (“EIP”) ​ As of November 30, 2022, the Company had
one
active stock-based equity plan, the
CytoDyn Inc. Amended and Restated 2012 Equity Incentive Plan
(the “EIP”), and
one
stock-based equity plan that is no longer active, but under which certain prior awards remain outstanding. As of May 31, 2022, the EIP covered a total of
34.3  million shares of common stock. As of May 31, 2022, the Board had released from reservation under the EIP a total of
22.0
million shares of common stock to permit their use for general purposes, leaving approximately
3.9
million shares available for future stock-based awards under the EIP. The Board also made a determination on May 31, 2022, to waive the “evergreen provision” that would have automatically increased the number of shares of common stock subject to the EIP by an amount equal to
1 % of the total outstanding shares on that date. Following approval by the stockholders of the
350.0
million increase in authorized shares of common stock on August 31, 2022, the
22.0
million shares were restored for issuance under the EIP. The EIP provides for awards of stock options to purchase shares of common stock, restricted and unrestricted shares of common stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and performance share units (“PSUs”).  The Company recognizes the compensation cost of employee and director services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date estimated fair value of the awards. The Company estimates the fair value of RSUs and PSUs using the value of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. Share-based compensation cost is recognized over the period during which the employee or director is required to provide service in exchange for the award and, as forfeitures occur, the associated compensation cost recognized to date is reversed. For awards with performance-based payout conditions, the Company recognizes compensation cost based on the probability of achieving the performance conditions, with changes in expectations recognized as an adjustment to earnings in the period of change. Any recognized compensation cost is reversed if the conditions are ultimately not met.   Stock-based compensation for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 was $ 1.8
million and $ 2.1
million, respectively, and for the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 was $ 3.1
million and $ 4.7
million, respectively. Stock-based compensation is recorded as part of general and administrative costs. ​ Stock Options and Warrants ​ 18

for the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.   Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) and Performance Stock Units (“PSUs”)   The Company’s stock incentive plan provides for equity instruments, such as RSUs and PSUs, which grant the right to receive a specified number of shares over a specified period of time. RSUs and PSUs are service-based awards that vest according to the terms of the grant.

million PSUs. The vesting of these awards is subject to the achievement of specified performance-based conditions, and the actual number of common shares that will ultimately be issued will be determined by multiplying this number of PSUs by a payout percentage ranging from  0 %
to  100 % .   Based on the estimated level of achievement of the performance targets associated with the PSUs as of November 30, 2022, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Company’s RSUs and PSUs was
$ 0.6  million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of  2.6  years.   Issuance of Shares to Former and Current Executives During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, the employment of our CEO and General Counsel was terminated. Under the terms of their respective employment agreements, the Company was obligated to pay severance equal to
18 months
of salary to our former CEO and
12 months
of salary to our former General Counsel. As permitted by the
19
Table of Contents employment agreements, in March 2022, the Board authorized the severance payments to our former CEO and the remaining severance payments to our former General Counsel to be made through the issuance of shares of common stock.
During the six months ended November 30, 2022, the Company issued to our former General Counsel a total of
79,391
shares of common stock to satisfy in full its obligation under the terms of the employment agreement. During the same period, consistent with the terms of our former CEO’s employment agreement, the Company also issued
380,704
shares of common stock as severance. The numbers of shares issued were based on the closing price of the common stock on the applicable date. In order to preserve cash resources, in April 2022, the Board approved the issuance to then executive officers of shares of common stock with a value equal to
25
percent of salary in lieu of cash, net of payroll deductions and withholding taxes. During the six months ended November 30, 2022, a total of
522,382
shares of common stock were issued pursuant to this cash preservation program. The number of shares issued was based on the closing price of the common stock on each payroll date. Private Placement of Warrants under Surety Bond Backstop Agreement On February 14, 2022, the Company entered into a Surety Bond Backstop Agreement (as amended, the “Backstop Agreement”) with an accredited investor, Dr. David Welch, in his individual capacity and as trustee of a revocable trust, as well as certain other related parties (collectively, the “Indemnitors”). Pursuant to the original terms of the Backstop Agreement, the Indemnitors agreed to assist the Company in obtaining a surety bond (the “Surety Bond”) for posting in connection with the Company’s ongoing litigation with Amarex Clinical Research, LLC ("Amarex”) by, among other things, agreeing to indemnify the issuer of the Surety Bond (the “Surety”) with respect to the Company’s obligations under the Surety Bond through August 13, 2022. As consideration for the Indemnitors’ agreement to indemnify the Surety, the Company agreed (i) to issue to 4-Good Ventures LLC, an affiliate of the Indemnitors (“4-Good”), a warrant for the purchase of
15,000,000
shares of common stock as a backstop fee (the “Initial Warrant”), (ii) to issue to 4-Good a warrant for the purchase of an additional
15,000,000
shares, to be exercisable only if the Indemnitors were required to make any payment to the Surety (the “Make-Whole Warrant” and, together with the Initial Warrant, the “4-Good Warrants”), and (iii) if the Indemnitors are required to make a payment to the Surety, (A) within
90 days
of such payment, to reimburse the Indemnitors for any amount paid to the Surety and (B) to pay to the Indemnitors an indemnification fee in an amount equal to
1.5
times the amount paid by the Indemnitors to the Surety. The payment obligations of the Company to the Indemnitors will bear interest at
10 % per annum and are secured by substantially all of the patents held by the Company. The Company recognized a finance charge of approximately $ 6.6
million related to the warrant issuance for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022.
Pursuant to amendments to the Backstop Agreement executed in July and December of 2022 (the “Backstop Amendment”), among other matters: (i) each of the 4-Good Warrants has a
five-year
term from the date of issuance and a reduced exercise price of $ 0.10
per share; (ii) the Make-Whole Warrant became fully exercisable in July 2022;
(iii) the Indemnitors were issued, in December 2022, a fully exercisable warrant to purchase
7,500,000
shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$ 0.10
per share; (iv) the Indemnitors were issued a second warrant in December 2022 covering up to
7,500,000
shares of common stock with an exercise price of
$ 0.10
per share, with the ultimate number of shares to be covered by the second warrant to be calculated on or before February 14, 2023, based on a formula relating to how quickly the Company relieves the balance of cash collateral pledged by the Indemnitors; and (v)
the obligation of the Indemnitors to indemnify the Surety was extended to January 31, 2023;
provided that the Company will relieve the Indemnitors of a minimum of
$ 1,500,000
of cash collateral currently pledged by the Indemnitors in support of the Surety Bond by January 5, 2023, with the balance of the cash collateral
($ 5,000,000 )
to be relieved by January 31, 2023; and provided further that, if the balance of the cash collateral on January 31, 2023, has been reduced to
$ 1,000,000
or less, the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect to require the Indemnitors to accept shares of common stock or warrants to purchase shares of common stock in exchange for the remaining balance. In January 2023, the Indemnitors agreed to extend the relief of the
$ 1,500,000
of cash collateral to January 13, 2023.
See
Liability Classified Warrants
above for the accounting treatment of the July 2022 amendment to the Backstop Agreement. Except as described above, the terms of the additional warrants issued in December 2022 are similar to the warrants issued under the original Backstop Agreement, filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 17, 2022. The shares covered by the additional warrants are entitled to registration rights. 20
Table of Contents ​ Following the issuance of the additional warrants, Dr. Welch is deemed to beneficially own in excess of
five  percent of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock.
​ Private Placement of Common Stock and Warrants through Placement Agent In April 2022, the Company initiated a private placement of common stock and warrants, completed in June 2022, to accredited investors through a placement agent. Between April and June 2022, the Company sold a total of approximately
85.4
million shares of common stock for a total of approximately $ 18.9
million of proceeds, net of issuance costs. Of these, approximately $ 7.7
million of proceeds, net of issuance costs, relating to approximately
34.6
million shares were remitted to the Company by May 31, 2022. Each unit sold included a fixed combination of
one
share of common stock and three-quarters of
one
warrant to purchase
one
share of common stock for a purchase price of $ 0.255
per unit. The Company issued approximately
64.0
million warrants to investors with each such warrant having a
five-year
term and an exercise price of
120 % of the final unit price, or $ 0.306
per share, and are immediately exercisable. The Company paid the placement agent a total cash fee of approximately $ 2.8
million, equal to
13 % of the gross proceeds of the offering, as well as a one-time fee for expenses of $ 50,000 , and issued a total of approximately
19.4
million warrants with an exercise price of $ 0.255
per share and a
ten-year
term, representing
13 % of the total number of shares, including shares subject to warrants sold in the offering, to the placement agent and its designees. The issuance of the warrants to the placement agent was subject to the approval by the Company’s stockholders of an increase in authorized shares of common stock, which was approved on August 31, 2022.
Down Round Provision Issuance and Modification to Previous Private Offerings
During the three months ended August 31, 2022, common stock and warrants previously issued between February and April 2022 to accredited investors directly by the Company in a private placement became subject to a down round provision under the original purchase agreements requiring the Company to reduce the purchase price of common stock from the original price of $ 0.40
to $ 0.255
per share, to increase the percentage of the warrant coverage from
50 % to
75 % based on the revised amount of total shares issued, and to reduce the exercise price of the warrants from the original price of $ 0.40
to $ 0.306 , the terms in the financing conducted by the Company through the placement agent as described above. As a result, an approximate additional
4.6
million shares of common stock and
5.5
million warrants were issued. The incremental fair value of the warrants were measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model, resulting in an approximately $ 4.2
million charge to additional paid-in capital which was accounted for as a deemed dividend. Warrant Expiration Extension During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company extended the expiration dates of approximately
3.8
million warrants to January 31, 2023. The previous expiration dates for the warrants ranged from September 2022 to December 2022. The modification to these equity instruments resulted in an approximate $ 0.5
million deemed dividend recorded in equity as of November 30, 2022, and was included in the loss per share calculations for the three- and six-month periods ended November 30, 2022-refer to Note 7,
Loss per Common Share . Warrant Exercises
During the six months ended November 30, 2022, the Company issued approximately  0.5  million shares of common stock in connection with the exercise of an equal number of warrants. The stated exercise prices ranged from $ 0.45  to $ 0.75  per share, which resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $ 0.3  million. Additionally, during the six months ended November 30, 2022, the Company issued approximately  0.2  million shares of common stock in connection with the cashless exercise of approximately  0.3  million warrants with stated exercise prices ranging from $ 0.26  to $ 0.50
per share. Private Warrant Exchanges
During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company entered into various separate privately negotiated warrant exchange agreements with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which the investors exercised warrants with an original exercise price of $ 1.00
per share in exchange for the issuance of approximately
9.7
million shares of common
21
Table of Contents stock upon exercise of the warrants, including approximately
8.4
million shares issued as an inducement for the exercises. Gross and net aggregate proceeds from the private warrant exchange were approximately $ 2.1
million. In connection
with these transactions, the Company recognized approximately $ 2.1
million as issuance costs and $ 0.5
million as a deemed dividend.
​ Note 7. Loss per Common Share Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted for preferred stock dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share includes the weighted average common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive common stock equivalents. Because of the net losses for all periods presented, the basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding are the same since including the additional shares would have an anti-dilutive effect on loss per share. The reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net loss per share computations are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three months ended November 30, ​ Six months ended November 30, (in thousands, except per share amounts) ​ 2022      2021 ​ 2022 ​ 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (Restated)

The Company calculates its quarterly taxes under the effective tax rate method based on applying an anticipated annual effective rate to its year-to-date income, except for discrete items. Income taxes for discrete items are computed and recorded in the period that the specific transaction occurs. The Company’s net tax expense for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 was
zero . The Company does not consider it more likely than not that the benefits from the net deferred taxes will be realized; therefore the Company maintains a full valuation allowance as of November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, thus creating a difference between the effective tax rate of
0 % and the statutory rate of
21 %. ​ Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies Commitments with Samsung BioLogics Co., Ltd.

On January 6, 2022, Samsung provided written notice to the Company alleging that the Company had materially breached the parties’ Master Services and Project Specific Agreements for failure to pay $ 13.5
million due on December 31, 2021. An additional $ 22.8
million became due under the agreements on January 31, 2022. Under the agreements, Samsung may be entitled to terminate its services if the parties cannot agree on the past-due balance. Management continues to be in ongoing discussions with Samsung regarding potential approaches to resolve these issues, including proposals by both parties of a revised schedule of payments over an extended period, proposals by the Company of satisfaction of a portion of the Company’s payment obligations in equity securities, through future financing, and/or potential licensing opportunities of the Company, proposals to postpone the manufacturing of unfulfilled commitments until a future regulatory approval, and proposals offsetting the unfulfilled commitments with other future potential R&D drug development needs related to the longer-acting therapeutic the Company is currently studying. Samsung has paused manufacturing all unfulfilled commitments not needed by the Company starting in January of 2022. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any accruals associated with the unfulfilled commitments as of November 30, 2022. In the event negotiations are unsuccessful, the Company may have to accrue a liability related to the unfulfilled commitments. As of November 30, 2022, the Company had past due balances of approximately $ 35.0
million due to Samsung, which were included in accounts payable. As of November 30, 2022, the future commitments pursuant to these agreements were estimated as follows (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ Fiscal Year      Amount

Legal Proceedings As of November 30, 2022, the Company did not record any legal accruals related to the outcomes of the matters described below. It may not be possible to determine the outcome of these proceedings, including the defense and other litigation-related costs and expenses that may be incurred by the Company, as the outcomes of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain. Therefore, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of any proceeding, if in excess of a recognized accrual, if any, could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Securities Class Action Lawsuit On March 17, 2021, a stockholder filed a putative class-action lawsuit (the “March 17, 2021 lawsuit”) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against the Company and certain former officers. The complaint generally alleges the defendants made false and misleading statements regarding the viability of leronlimab as a potential treatment for COVID-19. On April 9, 2021, a second stockholder filed a similar putative class action lawsuit in the same court, which the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on July 23, 2021. On August 9, 2021, the court appointed lead plaintiffs for the March 17, 2021 lawsuit. On December 21, 2021, lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which is brought on behalf of an alleged class of those who purchased the Company’s common stock between March 27, 2020 and May 17, 2021.
The amended complaint generally alleges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and/or 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making purportedly false or misleading statements concerning, among other things, the safety and efficacy of leronlimab as a potential treatment for COVID-19, the Company’s CD10 and CD12 clinical trials, and its HIV BLA.
The amended complaint also alleges that the individual defendants violated Section 20A of the Exchange Act by selling shares of the Company’s common stock purportedly while in possession of material nonpublic information.
The amended complaint seeks, among other relief, a ruling that the case may proceed as a class action and unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. On February 25, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On June 24, 2022, lead plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint.
The second amended complaint is brought on behalf of an alleged class of those who purchased the Company’s common stock between March 27, 2020 and March 30, 2022, makes similar allegations, names the same defendants, and asserts the same claims as the prior complaint, adds a claim for alleged violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) promulgated thereunder, and seeks the same relief as the prior complaint. The Company and the individual defendants deny all allegations of wrongdoing in the complaint and intend to vigorously defend the matter. Since this case is in an early stage where the number of plaintiffs is not known, and the claims do not specify an amount of damages, the Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the lawsuit and cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss or range of loss the Company may incur.

Table of Contents 2021 Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits On June 4, 2021, a stockholder filed a purported derivative lawsuit against certain of the Company’s former officers and directors, and the Company as a nominal defendant, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. Two additional shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against the same defendants in the same court on June 25, 2021 and August 18, 2021, respectively. The court has consolidated these
three
lawsuits for all purposes (“Consolidated Derivative Suit”). On January 20, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. The consolidated complaint generally alleges that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties by allowing the Company to make false and misleading statements regarding, among other things, the safety and efficacy of leronlimab as a potential treatment for COVID-19, the Company’s CD10 and CD12 clinical trials, and its HIV BLA, and by failing to maintain an adequate system of oversight and controls. The consolidated complaint also asserts claims against one or more individual defendants for waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, contribution for alleged violations of the federal securities laws, and for breach of fiduciary duty arising from alleged insider trading. The consolidated complaint seeks declaratory and equitable relief, an unspecified amount of damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs. The Company and the individual defendants deny all allegations of wrongdoing in the complaints and intend to vigorously defend the litigation. In light of the fact that the Consolidated Derivative Suit is in an early stage and the claims do not specify an amount of damages, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the Consolidated Derivative Suit and cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss or range of loss the Company may incur. Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice Investigations The Company has received subpoenas from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) requesting documents and information concerning, among other matters, leronlimab, the Company’s public statements regarding the use of leronlimab as a potential treatment for COVID-19, HIV, and triple-negative breast cancer, related communications with the FDA, investors, and others, litigation involving former employees, the Company’s retention of investor relations consultants, and trading in the Company’s securities. Certain former Company executives and directors have received subpoenas concerning similar issues and have been interviewed by the DOJ and SEC, including the Company’s former CEO, Nader Z. Pourhassan.
On January 24, 2022, Mr. Pourhassan was terminated and removed from the Board of Directors and has had no role at the Company since. On December 20, 2022, the DOJ announced the unsealing of a criminal indictment charging both Mr. Pourhassan, and Kazem Kazempour, CEO of Amarex Clinical Research LLC, a subsidiary of NSF International, Inc.,
and which had formerly served as the Company’s
CRO. Mr. Pourhassan was charged with
one
count of conspiracy,
four
counts of securities fraud,
three
counts of wire fraud, and
three
counts of insider trading. Mr. Kazempour was charged with
one
count of conspiracy,
three
counts of securities fraud,
two
counts of wire fraud, and
one
count of making a false statement. That same day, the SEC announced charges against both Mr. Pourhassan and Mr. Kazempour for alleged violations of federal securities laws. ​ The Company is committed to cooperating fully with the DOJ and SEC investigations, which are ongoing, and which the Company’s counsel frequently engages with them on. Further, the Company has made voluminous productions of information and made witnesses available for voluntary interviews. The Company will continue to comply with the requests of the SEC and DOJ. The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the DOJ and SEC investigations or the case against Mr. Pourhassan, nor can it predict whether any other governmental authorities will initiate separate investigations or litigation. The investigations and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include a wide variety of outcomes, including the institution of administrative, civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving the Company and/or former executives and/or former directors in addition to Mr. Pourhassan, the imposition of fines and other penalties, remedies and/or sanctions, modifications to business practices and compliance programs and/or referral to other governmental agencies for other appropriate actions. It is not possible to accurately predict at this time when matters relating to the investigations will be completed, the final outcome of the investigations, what additional actions, if any, may be taken by the DOJ or SEC or by other governmental agencies, or the effect that such actions may have on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition, which could be material. ​ The DOJ and SEC investigations, including any matters identified in the investigations and indictments, could also result in (1) third-party claims against the Company, which may include the assertion of claims for monetary damages,
25
Table of Contents including but not limited to interest, fees, and expenses, (2) damage to the Company's business or reputation, (3) loss of, or adverse effect on, cash flow, assets, results of operations, business, prospects, profits or business value, including the possibility of certain of the Company's existing contracts being cancelled, (4) adverse consequences on the Company's ability to obtain or continue financing for current or future projects and/or (5) claims by directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, attorneys, agents, debt holders or other interest holders or constituents of the Company or its subsidiaries, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Further, to the extent that these investigations and any resulting third-party claims yield adverse results over time, such results could jeopardize the Company's operations and exhaust its cash reserves, and could cause stockholders to lose their entire investment . ​ Amarex Dispute On October 4, 2021, the Company filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief and a motion for a preliminary injunction against NSF International, Inc. and its subsidiary Amarex Clinical Research LLC (“Amarex”), the Company’s former CRO. Over the past eight years, Amarex provided clinical trial management services to the Company and managed numerous clinical studies of the Company’s drug product candidate, leronlimab. On December 16, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland issued a preliminary injunction requiring Amarex to provide the Company with access to all of its materials in the possession of Amarex.
The court also granted CytoDyn the right to conduct an audit of Amarex’s work for CytoDyn. That case has been administratively closed. The Company simultaneously filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration demand alleges that Amarex failed to perform services to an acceptable professional standard and failed to perform certain services required by the parties’ agreements. Further, the demand alleges that Amarex billed the Company for services it did not perform. The Company contends that, due to Amarex’s failures, it has suffered avoidable delays in obtaining regulatory approval of leronlimab and has paid for services not performed. Amarex has counterclaimed alleging that CytoDyn has failed to pay invoices due under the contract between the parties.
In light of the fact that this dispute is in an early stage, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the lawsuit and cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss or range of loss that the Company may incur. ​ Note 10. Subsequent Events During December 2022, in satisfaction of redemptions, the Company and the April 2, 2021 Note holder entered into exchange agreements, pursuant to which portions of the April 2, 2021 Note were partitioned into new notes (the “December Partitioned Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of $ 1.0
million, which were exchanged concurrently with the issuance of approximately
4.7
million shares of common stock. The outstanding balance of the April 2, 2021 Note was reduced by the December Partitioned Notes to a principal amount of $ 8.3
million. ​ During December 2022, the Company entered into various separate privately negotiated warrant exchange agreements with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which the investors exercised warrants with an original exercise price of $ 0.50
- $ 0.75
per share in exchange for the issuance of approximately
3.4
million shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants, including approximately
0.6
million shares issued as an inducement for the exercises. Gross and net aggregate proceeds from the private warrant exchange were approximately $ 0.7
million. As of November 30, 2022 the Company held $ 0.2
million in restricted cash related to these transactions. In January 2023, the Company commenced an offering of units seeking to raise up to
$ 15.0
million in gross proceeds, with each unit consisting of
one
share of common stock and
one
warrant to purchase
one
share of common stock. The offering is being conducted in a private placement through a placement agent in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC thereunder. The securities being offered will not be registered for resale under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. The intended use of proceeds is to fund operations and for general corporate purposes, including the reduction of indebtedness. ​ ​ ​ 26

Overview The Company is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the clinical development and potential commercialization of its product candidate, leronlimab, which is being studied for NASH, NASH-HIV, solid tumors in oncology, and other HIV indications. Our current business strategy is to seek the removal of the partial clinical hold imposed by the US FDA in March 2022. In October 2022, the Company voluntarily withdrew its Biologic License Application (“BLA”) submission, for leronlimab as a combination therapy for highly treatment experienced HIV
27
Table of Contents patients, due to management’s conclusion that a significant risk existed that the BLA would not receive FDA approval due to the inadequate process and performance around the monitoring and oversight of the clinical data from its clinical trials by its former contract research organization (“CRO”). As further discussed in Part I, Item 1, Note 2,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Inventories,
and Note 3,
Inventories, net,
the Company previously capitalized procured or produced pre-launch inventories in preparation for product launches. The Company has reserved for or written off $96.4 million in previously capitalized pre-launch inventories. Although these inventories have been written off from an accounting perspective, they may still have clinical use. Second Quarter Overview HIV BLA
In October 2022, the Company voluntarily withdrew its BLA submission after concluding that a significant risk existed that the BLA would not receive FDA approval due to its former CRO’s inadequate process and performance around the monitoring and oversight of the clinical data. The Company is engaged in litigation with its former CRO; the Company obtained an order requiring the CRO to release the Company’s clinical data related to the BLA and other clinical trials, which the CRO had been withholding, thereby preventing the Company from completing necessary clinical data submissions to the FDA. The order granted the Company access to the data and the right to perform an audit of the CRO’s services, which has been completed. Partial Clinical Hold on HIV Program
In March 2022, the FDA notified the Company that it had placed a partial clinical hold on the Company’s HIV program; the Company was not enrolling any new patients in the trials placed on hold. The partial clinical hold on the HIV program impacted patients enrolled in HIV extension trials who were transitioned to other available therapeutics. No clinical studies can be initiated or resumed until the partial clinical hold is resolved. The Company’s efforts are focused on activities that will allow us to resolve the partial clinical hold.
HIV Pre-Clinical Development In December 2022, researchers from Oregon Health and Sciences University, an academic research collaboration partner of the Company, presented at the HIV DART Conference and the HIV Persistence During Therapy Conference results from two pre-clinical studies performed on macaque monkeys for two different potential longer-acting therapeutics targeting the CCR5 receptor. The first longer-acting potential therapeutic is a modified monoclonal antibody designed to have a longer half-life, which could lead to the development of an HIV prophylactic for humans at high risk of contracting HIV. The second longer-acting potential therapeutic is a gene therapy that could lead to the development of a functional cure for humans living with HIV.
While both longer-acting therapeutics are still in the early stages of development, early data from the macaque monkey studies suggest that increased dosing intervals from once weekly to over three months are possible. Data from both potential therapeutics were also presented during the Company’s R&D Investor Update on December 7, 2022, which is available on the Company’s website. By making this and other references to the Company’s website, we do not intend to incorporate by reference into this report any information posted on our website. The website should not be considered part of this report. NASH Clinical Developments In November 2022, the Company presented two posters at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) meeting in Washington, DC. The data presented expanded on the efficacy data from the CDI-NASH-01 trial (NCT04521114), which was previously presented at the EASLD meeting in June 2022, and is discussed in more detail below. This data presented included the functional biomarker and supportive mechanism of action data for leronlimab in NASH.
28
Table of Contents During November and December 2022, the Company presented the same data presented at the EASLD and AASLD meetings, at the NASH and Obesity Drug Development Summit held in Boston and further raised the clinical development needs for addressing NASH in people living with HIV. Similar data was also presented during the Company’s R&D Investor Update on December 7, 2022, which is available on the Company’s website. NASH is a chronic liver disease characterized by the presence of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH are at significantly higher risk of liver‐ related mortality. There is currently no approved drug for NASH.
Liver disease is one of the leading causes of non-AIDS-related death in HIV patients. The Company is identifying the next steps in clinical development to continue the investigation of leronlimab in the NASH indication and HIV patients with NASH.
In NASH, liver homeostasis is impaired due to an accumulation of toxic lipids which can activate both Kupffer cells (KCs) and tissue-resident macrophages resulting in the production of fibrogenic cytokines and chemoattractant chemokines such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Not only do these cytokines/chemokines promote transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into myofibroblasts (the primary source for fibrillary collagens), but they also amplify the immune response by recruiting additional cells into the damaged area.
Recruitment of extra-hepatic inflammatory cells to the site of hepatic injury is typically mediated by interactions between cytokines/chemokines and their receptors.
It has also been shown that patients with NASH also have high levels of C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and the associated ligand, CCL5, thus demonstrating a potential role of CCR5 and its ligands in liver fibrosis.
The potential for leronlimab in the treatment of NASH was demonstrated in a pre-clinical model of fatty liver disease. Immunodeficient, NOD-SCID Gamma (NSG) mice were fed a high fat, NASH-inducing diet, transplanted with human stem cells to repopulate the deficient immune system, and treated with leronlimab.
Sixteen (16) male NOD.Cg- Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ , commonly known as the NOD
scid
IL-2 receptor gamma knockout mice (NSG), were first humanized by intravenous inoculation with normal human umbilical cord blood cells (105). After 5 weeks on normal mouse chow, mice were successfully humanized, demonstrating >25% human CD45 cells in peripheral blood. Mice were switched to high fat (52%) high cholesterol (1.25%) diet (FPC diet: fructose, palmitate, cholesterol, trans-fat; Envigo-Teklad TD.160785). Leronlimab and control antibody (normal human IgG, Sigma) were administered i.p. at a dose of 2mg i.p. twice weekly, n=8 mice/group. The results showed that leronlimab inhibited fatty liver development, a key characteristic of early-stage NASH, such that treatment of humanized NSG mice with leronlimab caused a three-fold reduction in hepatic steatosis compared to control in an animal model of high fructose, high palmitate, high cholesterol diet.
The Company has reported clinical data from patients with NASH from the CDI-NASH-01 trial which was designed as a multi-center Phase 2a study and was subsequently converted into an exploratory study to evaluate the dose, efficacy, and safety of leronlimab at 350 mg and 700 mg, versus placebo. The study also included an expansive biomarker program designed to inform future clinical trials and to more fully understand leronlimab’s mechanism of action within the NASH setting. CDI-NASH-01 was run in two parts. Part 1 of the study was to assess the efficacy of leronlimab 700 mg (n=22) in improving NAFLD/NASH measures in adult patients diagnosed with NASH compared to placebo (n=28).
Part 2 was subsequently added to assess leronlimab 350 mg in improving NAFLD/NASH measures in adult patients diagnosed with NASH (n=22).
In Part 1 of the study, eligible subjects were randomized 1:1 to one of the two study arms to receive either leronlimab 700mg (Group A), or placebo (Group B), given once per week (±1day) at the study site for up to 13 weeks during the treatment period (with up to 60 participants). In Part 2 of the study, eligible subjects enrolled to receive leronlimab 350 mg open-label given once per week (±1day) at the study site for up to 13 weeks during the treatment period (with up to 28 participants). The primary efficacy objective was percent change from baseline in hepatic fat fraction, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging-derived proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) at week 14. The secondary efficacy objective was absolute change from baseline in fibro-inflammatory activity in the liver as assessed by MRI-corrected T1 imaging (MRI-cT1) at week 14. MRI-cT1 is obtained by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the liver and is a quantitative metric for assessing a composite of liver inflammation and fibrosis, expressed in milliseconds (msec). MRI-PDFF is being studied as an imaging surrogate endpoint for the fat density in the liver. MRI-cT1 is being studied as an imaging surrogate endpoint for hepatic fibro-inflammation. This is a critical unmet need in the NASH space, as many agents have been unable to show reductions in fibro-inflammation despite reductions in hepatic steatosis.
29
Table of Contents All analyses performed are being treated as exploratory. Treatment with leronlimab was well tolerated in both Part 1 and Part 2 compared to placebo. In Part 1 of the study, leronlimab 700 mg did not reduce mean change in PDFF and cT1 from baseline to week 14 vs. placebo. In Part 2, leronlimab 350 mg reduced mean change in PDFF and cT1 from baseline to week 14 vs. the placebo group from Part 1, despite increased degree of baseline fibro-inflammation. In the combined group of patients with moderate (≥ 875 msec) and severe (≥ 950 msec) cT1 values at baseline, leronlimab 350 mg reduced cT1 from baseline to week 14 vs. placebo.
Based on post hoc CCR5 haplotype analysis of a small subgroup (n=5), we are considering further investigation of the 700mg dose of leronlimab for specific haplotypes. Cancer Clinical Developments The Company continues to identify the next steps in clinical development and is exploring potential business opportunities to continue the investigation of leronlimab for solid tumors in oncology based on data generated to date by the Company.
Summary of TNBC Data To assess the impact of leronlimab treatment on mTNBC patients, we pooled the data from 3 studies: CD07_TNBC Phase 1b/2, CD07_TNBC_Compassionate Use, and CD-09 Basket. The study population for pooled efficacy analysis was a total of 28 subjects (10 subjects from the Phase 1b/2 study, 16 subjects from the Compassionate Use Study, and 2 subjects from the Basket Study). To explore the impact of leronlimab in the mTNBC patients’ disease progression, investigator assessed Progression Free Survival (PFS) was analyzed in the 28 subjects. There was a total of 19 subjects dosed between 525 mg and 700 mg (4 subjects increased dose from 350 mg to 525 mg and were included in the higher dose cohort). The median PFS (mPFS) for the 525 mg – 700 mg cohort was 6.2 months (95% CI 2.6 months - 7.5 months). There were 9 subjects dosed at 350 mg, mPFS was 2.2 months (95% CI 0.7 months - 12+ months). There was a meaningful PFS advantage at the higher doses when compared with the lower, 350 mg dose cohort.
Furthermore, the preliminary results of the leronlimab studies also showed similarity in the PFS outcomes of mTNBC patients treated with leronlimab + carboplatin compared to overall leronlimab treated population. Of the 28 subjects enrolled, 13 subjects received leronlimab + carboplatin treatment. The mPFS for leronlimab + carboplatin population was 3.9 months (95% CI 2.3 months - 6.0 months).
The subgroup analysis of PFS based on the individual subjects in each study was also reviewed. The mPFS for Phase 1b/2 study was 3.9 months (95% CI 2.3 months – 6.2 months), mPFS for the Compassionate Use study was 3.3 months (95% CI 1.3 months – 7.5 months), and mPFS for the Basket Study was 2.8 months (95% CI N/A).
Combined, the overall mPFS for all 28 patients treated with leronlimab in the population of mTNBC patients regardless of dosage, conjunction therapy type, brain or bone metastases that have failed more than one line of previous therapy was 4.1 months (95% CI 2.5 months – 7.0 months). The mean PFS was 3.7 ± 2.93 standard deviation (SD). To explore the impact of leronlimab in the mTNBC patients’ disease progression, Overall Survival (OS) was analyzed in the same 28 subjects. The median OS (mOS) for leronlimab + carboplatin population was 12+ months (95% CI 5.4 months - 12+ months). The mOS for the 350 mg cohort was 4.6 months (95% CI 1.1 months -12+ months). The mOS for the 525-700 mg cohort was 12+ months (95% CI 5.5 months – 12+ months). The overall median OS for leronlimab treated population of mTNBC patients regardless of brain or bone metastases that have failed more than one line of previous therapy was 6.5 months (95% CI 5.0 months – 12+ months). The mean value for OS was 5.5 ±4.31 standard deviation (SD). 30

Results of Operations Fluctuations in Operating Results
The Company’s operating results may fluctuate significantly depending on the outcomes, number and timing of pre-clinical and clinical studies, patient enrollment and/or completion rates in the studies, and their related effect on research and development expenses, regulatory and compliance activities, activities related to seeking removal of the partial clinical hold and FDA approval of our drug product, general and administrative expenses, professional fees, and legal proceedings and related consequences. We require a significant amount of capital to continue to operate; therefore, we regularly conduct financing offerings to raise capital, which may result in various forms of non-cash interest expense or other expenses. Additionally, we periodically seek to negotiate settlement of debt payment obligations in exchange for equity securities of the Company and enter into warrant exchanges or modifications that may result in non-cash charges. Our ability to continue to fund operations will depend on our ability to raise additional funds. Refer to

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Revision and Restatement of Financial Statements . Product revenue, Cost of goods sold (“COGS”) and Gross margin
We had no revenue in the three- and six-months ended November 30, 2022 as compared to approximately $225.0 and $266.0 thousand in the three and six months ended November 30, 2021. Revenue was related to the fulfillment of orders under a Compassionate Special Permit (“CSP”) in the Philippines for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Sales were made under the April 2021 exclusive supply and distribution agreement granting Chiral the right to distribute and sell up to 200,000 vials of leronlimab through April 15, 2022. At the time of the sales, FDA approval had not yet been received for leronlimab and the product sold was previously expensed as research and development expense due to its being manufactured prior to the commencement of the manufacturing of commercial grade pre-launch inventories. Therefore, COGS consists only of the costs of packaging and shipping of the vials, including related customs and duties. 32

The decreases in legal fees were due to lowered legal fees related to the SEC and DOJ investigations, Pestell employment dispute, Amarex dispute, and the absence of legal fees related to the prior year proxy contest and related lawsuits, as well as, in the six-month period, the payment of certain legal fees by the Company’s insurance carriers. The decreases in other were the result of a reduction in expenses related to the prior year proxy contest, insurance premiums, and recruiting and contract services. The decreases in salaries, benefits, and other compensation were the result of decreased headcount and cash compensation, as well as a decrease in stock-based compensation expense due to fewer equity grants being outstanding during the six months ended November 30, 2022.

(96) % ​ The decreases in R&D expenses in the three- and six-month periods ended November 30, 2022, compared to the same periods in the prior year, were primarily the result of clinical trials related to COVID-19, oncology, NASH, and HIV extension studies being completed, paused, or closed that had been active in the same periods of the prior year and decreased activity related to the BLA resubmission, offset by increased costs related to activities focused on the potential lifting of the clinical hold. The credit balance in clinical expenses is related to credits received related to the Brazilian COVID-19 trials.
The decreases in
chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (“CMC”)
related expenses from the same period last year were the result of decreased activity related to CMC manufacturing. The future trend of our R&D expenses is dependent on the timing of FDA clearance of the clinical hold, our decision-making on which indications on which to focus our future efforts toward the clinical development and study of leronlimab, which may include the treatment of NASH, NASH-HIV, oncology, and additional HIV indications and the timing and outcomes of such efforts.
Amortization and depreciation expenses
The decreases in amortization and depreciation expenses for the three- and six-month periods ended November 30, 2022, compared to the same periods last year were attributable to the intangible write-off of a proprietary algorithm intangible asset during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 and the ProstaGene noncompete intangible asset becoming fully amortized as of November 30, 2021. ​ 33
Table of Contents Inventory charge The increase in the inventory charge for the three- and six-month periods ended November 30, 2022, compared to the same periods in the prior year was primary attributable to pre-launch inventories no longer qualifying for inventory capitalization due to the withdrawal of the BLA submission, in addition to expected expiration based on estimated shelf lives for the six-month period.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Revision and Restatement of Financial Statements . The decreases in interest and other expenses for the three-month period ended November 30, 2022, compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in non-cash loss on induced conversion and inducement interest expense. The decreased non-cash loss on induced conversions resulted from the Company settling less outstanding convertible debt with common stock during the current period as compared to the same period last year (refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 14,
Restatement
in the 2022 Form 10-K). The decrease in inducement interest expense is the result of this now being recorded in stockholders’ equity as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2021-04 (refer to Note 2,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements ).
For the six-month period ended November 30, 2022, the decrease was primarily due to decreases in loss on induced conversion and inducement interest expense as discussed above, as well as a decrease in legal settlement expenses, offset by an increase in loss on derivatives. The decrease in legal settlement expense resulted from there being no legal settlements during the six months ended November 30, 2022. The increase in loss on derivatives was attributable to the change in the fair value of liability classified warrants related to the Surety Bond Backstop Agreement and placement agent warrants issued in connection with a recent offering for which the related warrants subsequently became equity classified upon the stockholders’ approval of an increase in authorized shares on August 31, 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of November 30, 2022, we had a total of approximately $2.6 million in cash and restricted cash and approximately $122.7 million in short-term liabilities. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and require a significant amount of capital in the future as we continue to develop and seek approval to commercialize leronlimab. Despite the Company’s negative working capital position, vendor relations remain relatively accommodative, and we do not currently anticipate significant delays in our business initiatives schedule due to liquidity constraints. We cannot be certain, however, that future funding will be available to us when needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We sell securities and incur debt when the terms of such arrangements are deemed acceptable to both parties under then current circumstances and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs. 34
Table of Contents Since inception, the Company has financed its activities principally from the public and private sale of equity securities as well as with proceeds from issuance of convertible notes and related party notes payable. The Company intends to finance its future operating activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of equity and debt securities. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities to raise additional capital is likely to result in dilution to stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of common shares. If the Company raises funds through the issuance of additional preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt or equity financing, the related transaction documents could contain covenants restricting its operations.
During the fiscal year 2021, the Company entered into long-term convertible notes that are secured by all of our assets (excluding our intellectual property), and include certain restrictive provisions, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and future dilutive issuances of securities, any of which could impair our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms. In exchange for warrants, the Company entered into a Backstop Agreement with an accredited investor whereby the Company pledged its patents and the investor agreed to indemnify the issuer of the surety bond in the Amarex dispute with respect to the Company’s obligations under the surety bond. Future third-party funding arrangements may also require the Company to relinquish valuable rights. Additional capital, if available, may not be available on reasonable or non-dilutive terms. Cash The Company’s cash and restricted cash position of approximately $2.6 million as of November 30, 2022, decreased by approximately $1.6 million, when compared to the balance of $4.2 million as of May 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily the result of approximately $15.5 million in cash used in our operating activities offset by approximately $13.9 million in cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended November 30, 2022. Refer to Item 1, Note 2,

The decrease in the net amount of cash used was due primarily to a decrease in our net loss, attributable to decreased G&A, R&D, and non-cash interest and other expense, and working capital fluctuations, all of which are highly variable. Refer to
General and Administrative, Research and Development , and
Interest and Other Expense
sections for further discussion. ​ Cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended November 30, 2022 did not change significantly from the prior year period. Cash provided by financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $13.9 million, a decrease of approximately $21.7 million compared to the six months ended November  30, 2021.
The decrease in net amount of cash provided was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately $17.5 million of cash through the private placement of common stock and warrants, with the balance due to decreased cash received for warrant and option exercises.

Table of Contents ​ Pre-launch inventories
The Company previously capitalized pre-launch inventories and subsequently in October of 2022 charged-off for GAAP accounting purposes due to no longer qualifying for inventory capitalization as pre-launch inventories due to the withdrawal of the BLA submission. Work-in-progress and finished drug product inventories continue to be physically maintained, can be used for clinical trials, and can be commercially sold upon regulatory approval if the shelf-lives can be extended as a result of the performance of on-going stability tests. Raw material continued to be maintained so that they can be used in the future if needed. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company reviewed purchase commitments made by its manufacturing partner, Samsung BioLogics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”), under the master agreement between the Company and Samsung, and its vendors for specialized raw materials for which the Company made a prepayment in the amount of $2.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, which were recorded as prepaid expenses in the consolidated financial statements as of May 31, 2022.
As discussed in Note 9,
Commitments and Contingencies – Commitments with Samsung BioLogics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”) ,
the Company and Samsung remain in ongoing discussions about, among other things, deferring the unfulfilled commitments. These additional specialized raw materials are estimated to have shelf-lives ranging from 2023 to 2026. The entire amount was charged-off as of August 31, 2022. In October 2022, the Company voluntarily withdrew its rolling BLA submission after concluding that a significant risk existed that the BLA would not receive FDA approval due to the inadequate process and performance by its former CRO around the monitoring and oversight of the clinical data from its trials.
Following this decision, none of the Company’s inventories now qualify for capitalization as pre-launch inventories.
For the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company charged-off the remaining raw material resin and work-in-progress bulk product inventories of approximately $16.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 2,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Pre-launch Inventories
in this Form 10-Q, and to Note 3,
Inventories, net , in the 2022 Form 10-K. Convertible debt
April 2, 2021 Convertible Note On April 2, 2021, we issued a convertible note with a principal amount of $28.5 million resulting in net cash proceeds of $25.0 million, after $3.4 million of debt discount and $0.1 million of offering costs. The note accrues interest daily at a rate of 10% per annum, contains a stated conversion price of $10.00 per share, and matures in April 2023. The April 2, 2021 Note required monthly debt reduction payments of $7.5 million for the six months beginning in May 2021, which could also be satisfied by payments on other notes held by the noteholder or its affiliates. Beginning six months after the issuance date, the noteholder may request monthly redemptions of up to $3.5 million. As of November 30, 2022, the outstanding balance of the April 2, 2021 Note, including accrued interest, was approximately $12.4 million. April 23, 2021 Convertible Note On April 23, 2021, we issued a convertible note with a principal amount of $28.5 million resulting in net cash proceeds of $25.0 million, after $3.4 million of debt discount and $0.1 million of offering costs. The note accrues interest daily at a rate of 10% per annum, contains a stated conversion price of $10.00 per share, and matures in April 2023. Beginning six months after the issuance date, the noteholder may request monthly redemptions of up to $7.0 million. As of November 30, 2022, the outstanding balance of the April 23, 2021 Note, including accrued interest, was approximately $32.8 million.

Commitments and Contingencies – Legal Proceedings
of this Form 10-Q. We are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including the defense and other litigation-related costs and expenses that may be incurred by the Company, as the outcomes of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain. Therefore, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of any proceeding, if in excess of a recognized accrual, if any, could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As of November 30, 2022, the Company did not record any legal accruals related to the outcomes of the matters discussed in this Form 10-Q.
Regulatory Matters Voluntary Withdrawal of HIV BLA Submission In July 2020, the Company received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding its BLA submission for leronlimab as a combination therapy with HAART for highly treatment-experienced HIV patients. In November 2021, the Company resubmitted the non-clinical and CMC sections of the BLA. In October 2022, the Company voluntarily withdrew its BLA submission due to management’s conclusion that a severe risk of the BLA not receiving approval by the FDA existed due to the Company’s former CRO's inadequate process and performance around the monitoring and

Commitments and Contingencies – Legal Proceedings . FDA Warning Letter re COVID-19 Misbranding of Investigational Drug In January 2022, the Company received a Warning Letter from the FDA alleging that its former CEO had made references in a video interview to COVID-19 and leronlimab in a promotional context to the effect that leronlimab, an investigational new drug, is safe and effective for the purpose for which it is being investigated or otherwise promoted the drug. The FDA warned the Company that leronlimab has not been approved or authorized by the FDA, its safety and effectiveness have not yet been established, and that the related clinical trial data was mischaracterized in the video. The FDA further alleged the video misbranded leronlimab under section 502(f)(1) of said Act and in violation of section 301(a) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, as the claims in the video made representations in a promotional context regarding the safety and efficacy of an investigational new drug that has not been approved or authorized by the FDA. CytoDyn has completed all the corrective steps requested by the FDA. On September 26, 2022, CytoDyn sent a letter to the FDA informing the FDA that it had completed all corrective steps and requested that FDA issue a close-out letter. ​ FDA HIV Partial Clinical Hold and COVID-19 Full Clinical Hold Letters In March 2022, the United States FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Company’s HIV program and a full clinical hold on its COVID-19 program in the United States. The Company was not enrolling any new patients in the trials placed on hold in the United States. Under the full clinical hold on the COVID-19 program, no new clinical studies may be initiated until the clinical hold is resolved. The Company has made a business decision not to pursue the use of leronlimab in COVID-19 patients, has no plans for further trials under the COVID-19 indication and has withdrawn the IND for COVID-19. Should the opportunity arise, the Company may explore potential non-dilutive clinical development options. CytoDyn is working diligently with the FDA to resolve the partial clinical hold for HIV as soon as possible.
As of the date of this filing, the Company has submitted the updated Investigator Brochure, the Development Safety Update Report (DSUR), and the Safety Management and Pharmacovigilance Plan to the FDA in connection with resolving the clinical hold. The Company is in the process of completing additionally requested materials and will submit them as soon as possible. Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had losses for all periods presented. The Company incurred a net loss of approximately $47.5 million in the six months ended November 30, 2022 and has an accumulated deficit of approximately $809.4 million as of November 30, 2022. These factors, among several others, including the various legal matters discussed in Note 9,
Commitments and Contingencies – Legal Proceedings , raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
The Company’s continuance as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional operating capital, complete the development of its product candidate, leronlimab, obtain approval to commercialize leronlimab from regulatory agencies, continue to outsource manufacturing of leronlimab, and ultimately achieve revenues and attain profitability. The Company plans to continue to engage in research and development activities related to leronlimab for multiple indications and expects to incur significant research and development expenses in the future, primarily related to its regulatory compliance, including seeking the lifting of the FDA’s partial clinical hold with regard to the Company’s HIV program, performing additional clinical trials, and seeking regulatory approval of its product candidate for commercialization. These research and development activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. The Company intends to finance its future development activities and its working capital needs primarily from the sale of equity and debt securities, combined with additional funding from other sources. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these endeavors. 38

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recent Accounting Pronouncements
of this Form 10-Q.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Pre-launch inventories We capitalize inventories procured or produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. Typically, capitalization of such inventory begins when the results of clinical trials have reached a status sufficient to support regulatory approval, uncertainties regarding ultimate regulatory approval have been significantly reduced and we have determined that it is probable that these capitalized costs will provide some future economic benefit in excess of capitalized costs. The material factors considered by the Company in evaluating these uncertainties include the receipt and analysis of positive Phase 3 clinical trial results for the underlying product candidate, results from meetings with the relevant regulatory authorities prior to the filing of regulatory applications, and the compilation of the regulatory application. We closely monitor the status of the product within the regulatory review and approval process, including all relevant communication with regulatory authorities. If we are aware of any specific material risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory review and approval process or if there are any specific issues identified relating to safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory may no longer qualify for capitalization.
We value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the average cost method. Inventories currently consist of raw materials, bulk drug substance, and drug product in unlabeled vials to be used for commercialization of the Company’s biologic, leronlimab, which is in the regulatory approval process. Inventory purchased in preparation for product launches is evaluated for recoverability by considering the likelihood that revenue will be obtained from the future sale of the related inventory, in light of the status of the product within the regulatory approval process. The Company evaluates its inventory levels on a quarterly basis and writes down inventory that has become obsolete or has a cost in excess of its expected net realizable value, and inventory quantities in excess of expected requirements. In assessing the lower of cost or net realizable value to pre-launch inventory, the Company relies on independent analysis provided by third parties knowledgeable of the range of likely commercial prices comparable to current comparable commercial product.
For inventories capitalized prior to FDA marketing approval in preparation of product launch, anticipated future sales, shelf-lives, and expected approval date are considered when evaluating realizability of pre-launch inventories. The shelf-life of a product is determined as part of the regulatory approval process; however, in assessing whether to capitalize pre-launch inventory the Company considers the stability data of all inventories. As inventories approach their shelf-life expiration, the Company may perform additional stability testing to determine if the inventory is still viable, which can result in an extension of its shelf-life. Further, in addition to performing additional stability testing, certain raw materials inventory may be sold in its then current condition prior to reaching expiration. We also consider potential delays associated with regulatory approval in determining whether preapproval inventory remains salable. In determining whether pre-approval inventory remains salable, the Company considers a number of factors ranging from potential delays associated with regulatory approval, whether the introduction of a competing product could negatively impact the demand for our product and affect the realizability of our inventories, whether physicians would be willing to prescribe leronlimab to their patients, or if the target patient population would be willing to try leronlimab as a new therapy.
Although the Company may conclude that certain inventories no longer qualify for capitalization as pre-launch inventories due to expiration of shelf-life prior to expected commercial sales and the ability to obtain additional commercial product stability data until after shelf-life expiration, and are therefore written-off for accounting purposes, we may continue to physically maintain them and may use them for clinical trials, or may sell them if the shelf-lives can be extended as a result of the performance of on-going continued stability testing of drug product. In the event the shelf-lives of these written-off inventories are extended, and the inventories are sold commercially, the Company will not recognize any costs of goods sold on the previously expensed inventories. 39
Table of Contents In October 2022, the Company voluntarily withdrew its BLA submission after concluding that a significant risk existed that the BLA would not receive FDA approval due to the inadequate process and performance by its former CRO around the monitoring and oversight of the clinical data from its trials.
Following this decision, none of the Company’s inventories now qualify for capitalization as pre-launch inventories.
See Note 3.,
Inventories, net. Stock-based compensation
We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant utilizing certain assumptions that require judgments and estimates. These assumptions include estimates for stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates in determining the fair value of the stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the equity award. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock at monthly intervals. The computation of the expected option term is based on the “simplified method,” as the options issued by the Company are considered “plain vanilla” options. In accordance with ASC 718,
Compensation -
Stock Compensation , the Company has elected to recognize the effect of forfeitures as they are incurred, and as such does not estimate future unvested forfeitures for all periods presented. Quarterly expense is reduced during the period when grants are forfeited, such that the full expense is recorded at the time of grant and only reduced when the grant is forfeited.
We at times issue restricted common stock and/or restricted stock units to executives or third parties as compensation for services rendered. Such awards are valued at fair market value on the effective date of the Company’s obligation. From time to time, we also issue stock options and warrants to consultants as compensation for services. Costs for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more readily measurable.
Contingent liabilities
We have significant license and contingent milestone and royalty liabilities. We estimate the likelihood of paying these contingent liabilities periodically based on the progress of our clinical trials, BLA approval status, and status of commercialization. We are also party to various legal proceedings. We recognize accruals for such proceedings to the extent a loss is determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The best estimate of a loss within a possible range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is more probable than another, then the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If it is determined that a material loss is not probable but reasonably possible it is disclosed and if the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the possible loss is also disclosed. It is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, including the defense and other litigation-related costs and expenses that may be incurred by the Company, as the outcomes of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the outcomes could differ significantly from recognized accruals. Therefore, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of any proceeding, if in excess of a recognized accrual, if any, could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. We periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes. Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 9,
Commitments and Contingencies
of this Form 10-Q for additional information. ​ Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There have been no material changes from the information previously reported under Part II, Item 7A of the 2022 Form 10-K.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures During the quarter ended November 30, 2022, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of November 30, 2022 due to the unremediated material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below. 40
Table of Contents We maintain controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("the Exchange Act"), is accurately recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As previously disclosed in Item 9A of the 2022 Form 10-K, during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, the Company identified an error that resulted in revisions to additional paid-in capital and non-cash inducement interest expense beginning in fiscal year 2018 through the three months ended August 31, 2021. Additionally, the Company also identified a material error in how the Company accounted for common stock issued to settle certain convertible note obligations dating back to fiscal year 2021. The error resulted in an understatement of the previously reported non-cash loss on induced conversion and additional paid-in capital. Therefore, management reached the following conclusions as of May 31, 2022. ● Management concluded that the failure to identify errors related to evaluation of complex accounting issues for which alternative accounting treatments exist constitutes a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. This material weakness is deemed to be caused by lack of review of equity transactions to allow for consideration of alternative accounting treatments, and an insufficient number of finance reporting and accounting personnel with the knowledge, experience, or training appropriate in light of the Company’s financial reporting requirements. ● The Company failed to perform an adequate risk assessment, did not adequately design, and did not fully document information technology (IT) general controls in the areas of user access, program change management, operations over certain IT systems that support the Company’s financial reporting processes, including controls to respond to the Complementary User Entity Controls assumed in the design and implementation of third-party service organizations controls. We concluded that in the aggregate, these failures constitute a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
A “material weakness” is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statement will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Macias Gini & O’Connell LLP, who audited the consolidated financial statements included in the 2022 Form 10-K, issued an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
In connection with the identification of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we continue to evaluate, design and implement controls and procedures to address these weaknesses. We have entered into consulting arrangements for external resources and have hired additional personnel with accounting skills to strengthen internal control over financial reporting, specifically in the areas of technical accounting and financial reporting. We also plan to perform a risk assessment of our internal controls related to information technology systems, and plan to design and place in operation controls tailored to address risks that we deem to be relevant to our company. Further, we plan to document all of our control activities in this area, including controls to respond to the Complementary User Entity Controls assumed in the design and implementation of third-party service organizations. A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a matter that may require some period of time to correct.

Table of Contents ​ ​ ​ ​ PART II
– Other Information ​ Item 1. Legal Proceedings There have been no material changes from the information previously reported in the 2022 Form 10-K. ​ Item 1A. Risk Factors We are subject to various risks, including risk factors identified in our 2022 Form 10-K. You should carefully consider these risk factors in addition to the risk factor below and other information in this Form 10-Q. Our cash reserves are extremely low, requiring that we raise substantial additional financing to satisfy our current payment obligations and to fund our operations, which continues to be difficult in light of the low trading price of our common stock. As of November 30, 2022, we had a cash and reserved cash balance of approximately $2.6 million. We must continue to raise substantial additional funds in the near term to meet our payment obligations and fund our operations. Additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, despite the approval by our stockholders of an additional 350.0 million authorized shares of common stock on August 31, 2022, we had only approximately 249.1 million shares of common stock unreserved for other purposes and available for issuance in new financing transactions. We will need to use some of the additional authorized shares (or funds raised through the sale of such shares) to satisfy our outstanding accounts payable and accrued liabilities. If we are not able to raise additional funds on a timely basis, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our planned operating activities, including continuing to seek removal of the clinical hold placed on us by the FDA, analyzing clinical trial data for purposes of responding to FDA requirements and preparing additional regulatory submissions, developing additional clinical trials for indications we plan to pursue, regulatory and compliance activities, and legal defense activities. Any delay or inability to pursue our planned activities likely will adversely affect our business, financial condition, and stock price. The continued low trading price of our common stock (with a closing price of $0.23 per share on January 5, 2023) presents a significant challenge to our ability to raise additional funds.  If we deplete our cash reserves, we may have to discontinue our operations and liquidate our assets. We face risks and uncertainties related to litigation, regulatory actions and government investigations and inquiries. ​ We are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation, other claims, suits, regulatory actions and government investigations and inquiries. For example, the Company has received subpoenas from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) requesting documents and information concerning, among other matters, leronlimab, the Company’s public statements regarding the use of leronlimab as a potential treatment for COVID-19, HIV, and triple-negative breast cancer, related communications with the FDA, investors, and others, litigation involving former employees, the Company’s retention of investor relations consultants, and trading in the Company’s securities. Certain former Company executives and directors have received subpoenas concerning similar issues and have been interviewed by the DOJ and SEC, including the Company’s former CEO, Nader Z. Pourhassan.
On December 20, 2022, the DOJ announced the unsealing of a criminal indictment charging both Mr. Pourhassan and Kazem Kazempour, CEO of Amarex Clinical Research LLC, a subsidiary of NSF International, Inc., and which had formerly served as the Company’s CRO. Mr. Pourhassan was charged with one count of conspiracy, four counts of securities fraud, three counts of wire fraud, and three counts of insider trading. Mr. Kazempour was charged with one count of conspiracy, three counts of securities fraud, two counts of wire fraud, and one count of making a false statement. That same day, the SEC filed a complaint against Mr. Pourhassan and Mr. Kazempour, alleging violations of federal securities laws. 42
Table of Contents We have cooperated, and will continue to cooperate, with these and any other regulatory or governmental proceedings. We have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses as a result of the regulatory and legal matters. The total cost associated with these matters will depend on many factors, including their duration and any related findings. Additionally, two putative class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our former officers and directors, asserting violations of federal securities laws under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and alleging that the Company and certain former officers and directors made purportedly false or misleading statements concerning, among other things, the safety and efficacy of leronlimab as a potential treatment for COVID-19, the Company’s CD10 and CD12 clinical trials, and its HIV BLA. The amended complaint also alleges that the individual defendants violated Section 20A of the Exchange Act by selling shares of the Company’s common stock purportedly while in possession of material nonpublic information. Separately, three purported CytoDyn stockholder derivative actions were filed against certain former officers and former directors, and the Company was named as a nominal defendant. The complaint generally alleges that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties by allowing the Company to make false and misleading statements regarding, among other things, the safety and efficacy of leronlimab as a potential treatment for COVID-19, the Company’s CD10 and CD12 clinical trials, and its HIV BLA, and by failing to maintain an adequate system of oversight and controls. The consolidated complaint also asserts claims against one or more individual defendants for waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, contribution for alleged violations of the federal securities laws, and for breach of fiduciary duty arising from alleged insider trading. ​ In addition, from time to time, we may also be involved in legal proceedings and investigations arising in the ordinary course of business, including those relating to employment matters, relationships with partners, intellectual property disputes, and other business matters. Any such claims or investigations may be time-consuming, costly, divert management resources, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business or result of operations. ​ The results of litigation and other legal proceedings, including the other claims described under Note 9,
Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Note 10 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2022, are inherently uncertain and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. The litigation and other legal proceedings described under Note 9,  Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and to Note 10 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2022 are subject to future developments and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds During October and November 2022, the Company issued a total of approximately 0.2 million shares of common stock in satisfaction of a total of approximately $80.4 thousand in severance payments due in October and November 2022 to our former CEO. The numbers of shares issued were based on the closing price of the common stock on the applicable dates. The Company relied on the exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act in connection with the issuance of the shares. During November and December 2022, in satisfaction of a redemption, the Company and the April 2, 2021 Note holder entered into exchange agreements, pursuant to which the April 2, 2021 Note was partitioned into new notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 million, which were exchanged concurrently with the issuance of approximately 6.5 million shares of common stock. The Company relied on the exemption
afforded by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act for the exchange transactions described above . During October and December 2022, the Company entered into various separate privately negotiated warrant exchange agreements with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which the investors exercised warrants with an original exercise price between $0.50 and $0.75 per share in exchange for the issuance of approximately 3.6 million shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants, including approximately 0.6 million shares issued as an
43
Table of Contents inducement for the exercises. Gross and net aggregate proceeds from the private warrant exchange were both approximately $0.8 million. The Company relied on the exemption provided by Rule 506 of Regulation D and Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), for the sales of securities in the private warrant exchange. In August 2022, the Company issued a total of approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock upon the conversion of 568 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock. In September 2022, the Company issued approximately 0.3 million shares of common stock in satisfaction of accrued dividends on the converted shares of preferred stock. The Company relied on the exemption afforded by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act for the issuances.
​ During September 2022, the Company issued a total of approximately 22.7 thousand shares of common stock and approximately 0.1 million warrants as part of a make-whole transaction with previous investors. The Company relied on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 promulgated by the SEC thereunder. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 44
