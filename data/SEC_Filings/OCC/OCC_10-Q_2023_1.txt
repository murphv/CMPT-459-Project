Condensed Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Three Months Ended January 31, 2023
(Unaudited)
(1)
General
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Optical Cable Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “OCC®”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10‑Q and Regulation S‑X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2023 because the following items, among other things, may impact those results: changing macroeconomic conditions in various markets, direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic including (but not limited to) supply chain and labor constraints impacting production volumes, increased costs and COVID-19 related government and private industry mandates in the areas of the world in which we operate, changes in market conditions, seasonality, inflation and interest rates, changes in technology, competitive conditions, timing of certain projects and purchases by key customers, significant variations in sales resulting from high volatility and timing of large sales orders among a limited number of customers in certain markets, ability of management to execute its business plans, continued ability to maintain and/or secure future debt and/or equity financing to adequately finance ongoing operations; as well as other variables, uncertainties, contingencies and risks set forth as risks in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 (including those set forth in the “Forward-Looking Information” section), or as otherwise set forth in other filings by the Company as variables, contingencies and/or risks possibly affecting future results. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and condensed notes are presented as permitted by Form 10‑Q and do not contain certain information included in the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and notes. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.

as of January 31, 2023 related to the surrender of shares by participants to pay for withholding taxes on shares that vested on January 31, 2023.
As of January 31, 2023, the estimated amount of compensation cost related to unvested equity-based compensation awards in the form of service-based and operational performance-based shares that the Company will recognize over a

Leases
The Company has an operating lease agreement for approximately
34,000
square feet of office, manufacturing and warehouse space in Plano, Texas (near Dallas). The lease term expires on November 30, 2024.
The Company has an operating lease agreement for approximately
36,000
square feet of warehouse space in Roanoke, Virginia. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the lease term was extended for an additional three years. The new expiration date is April 30, 2026.
The Company also leases certain office equipment under operating leases with initial
60
month terms. The lease terms expire in February and April of 2025.
OCC leases printers that are used in the Roanoke, Virginia manufacturing facility. The lease term expires on August 22, 2026. The right-of-use asset is being amortized on a straight line basis over seven years. When the lease term ends, the remaining net book value of the right-of-use asset will be classified as property and equipment.
The Company’s lease contracts may include options to extend or terminate the leases. The Company exercises judgment to determine the term of those leases when such options are present and include such options in the calculation of the lease term when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options.
The Company includes contract lease components in its determination of lease payments, while non-lease components of the contracts, such as taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance, are expensed as incurred. At commencement, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are measured at the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the time of lease commencement to measure the present value of future payments.

Fair Value Measurements
The carrying amounts reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 for cash, trade accounts receivable, other receivables, current installments of long-term debt, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and accrued compensation and payroll taxes approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying values of the Company’s note payable, revolver – noncurrent, and long-term debt, excluding current installments, approximate fair value based on long-term debt issues available to the Company as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022. Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share
Basic net income (loss) per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the net income (loss) of the Company.
The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the net income (loss) per share computations for the periods presented:

Segment Information and Business and Credit Concentrations
The Company provides credit, in the normal course of business, to various commercial enterprises, governmental entities and not‑for‑profit organizations. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is normally limited due to the Company’s large number of customers. The Company also manages exposure to credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures. Management believes that credit risks as of January 31, 2023 have been adequately provided for in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company includes all entities under common ownership for the purpose of calculating business concentrations.
For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022,
14.8 % and
17.2 %, respectively, of consolidated net sales were attributable to
one
national distributor customer.
The Company has a single reportable segment for purposes of segment reporting.
(11)
Revenue Recognition
Revenues consist of product sales that are recognized at a specific point in time under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer.  The Company considers customer purchase orders, governed by master sales agreements or the Company’s standard terms and conditions, to be the contract with the customer.  For each contract, the promise to transfer the control of the products, each of which is individually distinct, is considered to be the identified performance obligation. The Company evaluates each customer’s credit risk when determining whether to accept a contract.
In determining transaction prices, the Company evaluates whether fixed order prices are subject to adjustment to determine the net consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. Contracts do not include financing components, as payment terms are generally due 30 to 90 days after shipment. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from the customer including, but not limited to, sales and use taxes and value-added taxes, are not included in the transaction price and are not included in net sales.
The Company recognizes revenue at the point in time when products are shipped or delivered from its manufacturing facility to its customer, in accordance with the agreed upon shipping terms.  Since the Company typically invoices the customer at the same time that performance obligations are satisfied, no contract assets are recognized. The Company’s contract liability represents advance consideration received from customers prior to transfer of the product.  This liability was $ 59,313
as of January 31, 2023 and $ 317,310
as of October 31, 2022.
Sales to certain customers are made pursuant to agreements that provide price adjustments and limited return rights with respect to the Company’s products.  The Company maintains a reserve for estimated future price adjustment claims, rebates and returns as a refund liability. The Company’s refund liability was $ 257,749
as of January 31, 2023 and $ 233,494
as of October 31, 2022.
The Company offers standard product warranty coverage which provides assurance that its products will conform to contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment. Separately-priced warranty coverage is not offered. The warranty claim is generally limited to a credit equal to the purchase price or a promise to repair or replace the product for a specified period of time at no additional charge.

The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as a cost to fulfill its promise to transfer control of the related product.  Shipping and handling costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company incurs sales commissions to acquire customer contracts that are directly attributable to the contracts.  The commissions are expensed as selling expenses during the period that the related products are transferred to customers.

Contingencies
From time to time, the Company is involved in various claims, legal actions and regulatory reviews arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
The Company believes continuing and lingering direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and certain macroeconomic trends as the COVID-19 pandemic has become more endemic-like in the U.S. have created challenges that have affected production volumes and sales. While improving, the Company has continued to experience certain challenges recruiting additional personnel (particularly, production personnel), as well as certain raw material supply chain challenges, which can impact sales, shipped product volumes, pricing and lead times for certain products. The Company believes it has taken steps to successfully mitigate (to a certain extent) the impacts of these challenges; however, at this time the Company believes these challenges may continue.
The extent to which any direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and certain related macroeconomic trends may continue to affect the Company in the future will depend on ongoing developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of any future outbreaks; the timing and extent of any imposition or easing of restrictions on businesses and individuals in various markets; any impact on product demand in certain of the Company’s markets; the potential for any resurgence of the virus (including its variant strains); any supply chain and labor constraints impacting production volumes and costs directly or indirectly resulting from the pandemic and after effects of the pandemic; as well as a variety of other unknowable factors.

Overview of COVID-19 Effects
As the COVID-19 pandemic has become more endemic-like in the U.S., we believe continuing and lingering direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and certain macroeconomic trends have created certain challenges that have affected production volumes and sales. While improving, we have continued to experience certain challenges recruiting additional personnel (particularly, production personnel), as well as certain raw material supply chain challenges, which can impact sales, shipped product volumes, pricing and lead times for certain products.

Results of Operations
We sell our products internationally and domestically to our customers which include major distributors, various regional and smaller distributors, original equipment manufacturers and value-added resellers. All of our sales to customers outside of the United States are denominated in U.S. dollars. We can experience fluctuations in the percentage of net sales to customers outside of the United States and in the United States from period to period based on the timing of large orders, coupled with the impact of increases and decreases in sales to customers in various regions of the world. Sales outside of the U.S. can also be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies.
Net sales
consist of gross sales of products by the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis less discounts, refunds and returns. Revenue is recognized at the time product is transferred to the customer (including distributors) at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for the product. Our customers generally do not have the right of return unless a product is defective or damaged and is within the parameters of the product warranty in effect for the sale.

Table of Contents
Cost of goods sold
consists of the cost of materials, product warranty costs and compensation costs, and overhead and other costs related to our manufacturing operations. The largest percentage of costs included in cost of goods sold is attributable to costs of materials.
Our gross profit margin percentages are heavily dependent upon product mix on a quarterly basis and may vary based on changes in product mix. To the extent not impacted by product mix, gross profit margins tend to be higher when we achieve higher net sales levels, as certain fixed manufacturing costs are spread over higher sales. Hybrid cables (containing fiber and copper) with higher copper content tend to have lower gross profit margins.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
(“SG&A expenses”) consist of the compensation costs for sales and marketing personnel, shipping costs, trade show expenses, customer support expenses, travel expenses, advertising, bad debt expense, the compensation costs for administration and management personnel, legal, accounting, advisory and professional fees, costs incurred to settle litigation or claims and other actions against us, and other costs associated with our operations.
Royalty income (expense), net
consists of royalty income earned on licenses associated with our patented products, net of royalty and related expenses.
Amortization of intangible assets
consists of the amortization of the costs, including legal fees, associated with internally developed patents that have been granted. Amortization of intangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets.
Other income (expense), net
consists of interest expense and other miscellaneous income and expense items not directly attributable to our operations.

Net Sales
Consolidated net sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 increased 26.6% to $18.3 million, compared to net sales of $14.4 million for the same period last year. We experienced an increase in net sales in both our enterprise and specialty markets, including the wireless carrier market, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, compared to the same period last year.
Net sales to customers in the United States increased 20.0% and net sales to customers outside of the United States increased 61.4% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, compared to the same period last year. We can experience fluctuations in sales from quarter to quarter in the various markets (both industries and geographies) in which we operate for various reasons.

Table of Contents
We believe the increase in net sales was positively impacted by increased product demand and increased production throughput during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, compared to the same period last year, as well as improved product pricing which began to take effect for new orders received during the latter half of fiscal year 2022. Our sales order backlog/forward load exceeded $11.0 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2023—continuing to be higher than typical levels while down from more than $12.0 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. We continued to see some positive indicators in our markets during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, and at this time we believe we will benefit from this trend during fiscal year 2023; however, such expectations could be negatively impacted by macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, and any further direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Gross Profit
Our gross profit was $6.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, an increase of 61.2% compared to gross profit of $4.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Gross profit margin, or gross profit as a percentage of net sales, increased to 35.7% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 compared to 28.0% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.
Our gross profit margins tend to be higher when we achieve higher net sales levels due to our operating leverage as certain fixed manufacturing costs are spread over higher sales. This operating leverage, which is beneficial at higher sales levels, positively impacted our gross profit margin during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 when compared to the same period last year. Our gross profit margin percentages are also heavily dependent upon product mix on a quarterly basis and may vary based on changes in product mix.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses
SG&A expenses increased to $5.5 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, compared to $4.8 million for the same period last year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 29.8% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, compared to 33.1% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.
The increase in SG&A expenses during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 compared to the same period last year was primarily the result of increases in employee and contracted sales personnel related costs totaling $461,000. Included in employee and contracted sales personnel related costs are employee incentives and commissions which increased due to increased net sales and the improved financial results during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.
Also contributing to the increase in SG&A expenses during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 were increases in shipping costs totaling $96,000 due to the increase in net sales and the increase in the costs charged by shippers, when compared to the same period last year.
Royalty Income (Expense), Net
We recognized royalty expense, net of royalty income, totaling $7,000 during the first quarter of fiscal years 2023 and 2022. Royalty expense and/or income may fluctuate based on sales of related licensed products and estimates of amounts for non-licensed product sales, if any.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
We recognized $13,000 of amortization expense, associated with intangible assets, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, compared to $12,000 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.
19
Table of Contents
Other Income (Expense), Net
We recognized other expense, net in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 of $203,000, compared to $170,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Other expense, net is comprised primarily of interest expense together with other miscellaneous items.
Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes
We reported income before income taxes of $842,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, compared to a loss before income taxes of $923,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. The improvement was primarily due to the increase in gross profit of $2.5 million, partially offset by the increase in SG&A expenses of $675,000.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
Income tax expense totaled $32,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, compared to $13,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Our effective tax rate was 3.9% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 and negative 1.4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.
Fluctuations in our effective tax rates are primarily due to permanent differences in U.S. GAAP and tax accounting for various tax deductions and benefits, but can also be significantly different from the statutory tax rate when income or loss before taxes is at a level such that permanent differences in U.S. GAAP and tax accounting treatment have a disproportional impact on the projected effective tax rate.
We previously established a valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets. As a result of establishing a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, if we generate sufficient taxable income in subsequent periods to realize a portion or all of our net deferred tax assets, our effective income tax rate could be unusually low due to the tax benefit attributable to the necessary decrease in our valuation allowance. Further, if we generate losses before taxes in subsequent periods, our effective income tax rate could also be unusually low as any increase in our net deferred tax asset from such a net operating loss for tax purposes would be offset by a corresponding increase to our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets.
If we generate sufficient income before taxes in subsequent periods such that U.S. GAAP would permit us to conclude that the removal of any valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset is appropriate, then during the period in which such determination is made, we will recognize the non-cash benefit of such removal of the valuation allowance in income tax expense on our consolidated statement of operations, which will increase net income and will also increase the net deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet. If we do not generate sufficient income before taxes in subsequent periods such that U.S. GAAP would permit us to conclude that the reduction or removal of any valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset is appropriate, then no such non-cash benefit would be realized. There can be no assurance regarding any future realization of the benefit by us of all or part of our net deferred tax assets. As of October 31, 2022, the valuation allowance against our total gross deferred tax assets totaled $4.4 million.
Net Income (Loss)
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 was $810,000 compared to a net loss of $936,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. This improvement was primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes of $1.8 million.

Financial Condition
Total assets increased $1.9 million, or 4.8%, to $42.5 million at January 31, 2023, from $40.6 million at October 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to a $2.8 million increase in inventories, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in trade accounts receivable, net. Inventories increased largely as the result of the timing of certain raw material purchases, increases in work in process levels related to pending shipments, and the increase in finished goods inventory resulting from higher replenishment rates of stock inventory. Trade accounts receivable, net decreased due primarily to the decrease in net sales in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022.
Total liabilities increased $1.1 million, or 6.0%, to $19.5 million at January 31, 2023, from $18.4 million at October 31, 2022. The increase in total liabilities was primarily due to net borrowings on our Revolver totaling $823,000 and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses totaling $204,000 primarily resulting from the timing of raw material purchases and certain vendor payments.
Total shareholders’ equity at January 31, 2023 increased $844,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. The increase resulted from net income of $810,000 and share-based compensation, net of $34,000.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary capital needs have been to fund working capital requirements through payments on our Revolver. Our primary source of capital for these purposes has been existing cash, cash provided by operations and borrowings under our Revolver (see “Credit Facilities” below).
Our cash totaled $186,000 as of January 31, 2023, a decrease of $30,000 compared to $216,000 as of October 31, 2022. The decrease in cash for the three months ended January 31, 2023 primarily resulted from net cash used in operating activities of $630,000 and capital expenditures totaling $105,000, partially offset by net cash provided by financing activities of $707,000.
On January 31, 2023, we had working capital of $25.4 million compared to $23.7 million on October 31, 2022. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities as of January 31, 2023 was 4.3 to 1.0 compared to 4.2 to 1.0 as of October 31, 2022. The increase in working capital and in the current ratio was primarily due to the increase in inventories of $2.8 million, partially offset by the $1.1 million decrease in trade accounts receivable, net.
As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, we had outstanding loan balances under our Revolver totaling $6.8 million and $6.0 million, respectively. As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, we had other outstanding bank loan balances, excluding our Revolver, totaling $4.4 million and $4.5 million, respectively.
Net Cash
Net cash used in operating activities was $630,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, compared to $1.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Net cash used in operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 primarily resulted from an increase in inventories totaling $2.8 million, partially offset by certain adjustments to reconcile net income of $810,000 to net cash used in operating activities including depreciation and amortization of $248,000 and share-based compensation expense of $135,000. Additionally, the cash flow impact of decreases in trade accounts receivable, net of $1.1 million and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $120,000 further contributed to offset net cash used in operating activities.
Net cash used in operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 primarily resulted from an increase in inventories totaling $1.6 million, partially offset by certain adjustments to reconcile a net loss of $936,000 to net cash used in operating activities including depreciation and amortization of $286,000 and share-based compensation expense of $124,000. Additionally, the cash flow impact of increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, including accrued compensation and payroll taxes, of $572,000 further contributed to offset net cash used in operating activities.

Table of Contents
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $106,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, compared to $81,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Net cash used in investing activities during the first quarter of fiscal years 2023 and 2022 resulted primarily from purchases of property and equipment and deposits for the purchase of property and equipment.
Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $707,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, compared to $2.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Net cash provided by financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 resulted primarily from net proceeds on our revolving line of credit totaling $823,000, partially offset by principal payments on long-term debt totaling $83,000. Net cash provided by financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 resulted primarily from net proceeds on our revolving line of credit totaling $2.1 million, partially offset by principal payments on long-term debt totaling $80,000.
Credit Facilities
We have credit facilities consisting of a real estate term loan, as amended and restated (the “Virginia Real Estate Loan”), a supplemental real estate term loan, as amended and restated (the “North Carolina Real Estate Loan”) and a Revolving Credit Master Promissory Note and related agreements (collectively, the “Revolver”).
Both the Virginia Real Estate Loan and the North Carolina Real Estate Loan are with Northeast Bank, have a fixed interest rate of 3.95% and are secured by a first lien deed of trust on the Company’s real property.
The Revolver with North Mill Capital LLC (doing business as SLR Business Credit, “SLR”) provides us with one or more advances in an amount up to: (a) 85% of the aggregate outstanding amount of eligible accounts (the “eligible accounts loan value”); plus (b) the lowest of (i) an amount up to 35% of the aggregate value of eligible inventory, (ii) $5.0 million, and (iii) an amount not to exceed 100% of the then outstanding eligible accounts loan value; minus (c) $1.15 million.
The maximum aggregate principal amount subject to the Revolver is $18.0 million. Interest accrues on the daily balance at the per annum rate of 1.5% above the Prime Rate in effect from time to time, but not less than 4.75% (the “Applicable Rate”). In the event of a default, interest may become 6.0% above the Applicable Rate. As of January 31, 2023, the Revolver accrued interest at the prime lending rate plus 1.5% (resulting in a 9.0% rate at January 31, 2023). The termination date of the Revolver is July 24, 2025 and the loan may be extended in one year periods subject to the agreement of SLR.
The Revolver is secured by all of the following assets: properties, rights and interests in property of the Company whether now owned or existing, or hereafter acquired or arising, and wherever located; all accounts, equipment, commercial tort claims, general intangibles, chattel paper, inventory, negotiable collateral, investment property, financial assets, letter-of-credit rights, supporting obligations, deposit accounts, money or assets of the Company, which hereafter come into the possession, custody, or control of SLR; all proceeds and products, whether tangible or intangible, of any of the foregoing, including proceeds of insurance covering any or all of the foregoing; any and all tangible or intangible property resulting from the sale, lease, license or other disposition of any of the foregoing, or any portion thereof or interest therein, and all proceeds thereof; and any other assets of the Company which may be subject to a lien in favor of SLR as security for the obligations under the Loan Agreement.
As of January 31, 2023, we had $6.8 million of outstanding borrowings on our Revolver and $4.8 million in available credit.

Capital Expenditures
We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of January 31, 2023. During our 2023 fiscal year budgeting process, we included an estimate for capital expenditures of $1.0 million for the fiscal year. We anticipate these expenditures, to the extent made, will be funded out of our working capital, cash provided by operations or borrowings under our Revolver, as appropriate. Capital expenditures are reviewed and approved based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, current cash flow considerations, the expected return on investment, project priorities, impact on current or future product offerings, availability of personnel necessary to implement and begin using acquired equipment, and economic conditions in general. Additionally, total capital expenditures exceeding $1.0 million per fiscal year would require approval from our lender.
Corporate acquisitions and other strategic investments, if any, are considered outside of our annual capital expenditure budgeting process.
Future Cash Flow Considerations
We believe that our future cash flow from operations, our cash on hand and our existing credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.
From time to time, we are involved in various claims, legal actions and regulatory reviews arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Seasonality
We typically expect net sales to be relatively lower in the first half of each fiscal year and relatively higher in the second half of each fiscal year, and excluding other volatility, we would normally expect 48% of total net sales to occur during the first half of a fiscal year and 52% of total net sales to occur during the second half of a fiscal year. We believe this historical seasonality pattern is generally indicative of an overall trend and reflective of the buying patterns and budgetary cycles of our customers. However, this pattern may be altered during any quarter or year by the quarterly and annual volatility of orders received for the wireless carrier market, the timing of larger projects, timing of orders from larger customers, other economic factors impacting our industry or impacting the industries of our customers and end-users, and macroeconomic conditions. While we believe seasonality may be a factor that impacts our quarterly net sales results, particularly when excluding the volatility of sales in the wireless carrier market, we are not able to reliably predict net sales based on seasonality because these other factors can also, and often do, substantially impact our net sales patterns during the year.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying condensed notes that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10‑Q and Regulation S‑X. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022 provides a summary of our significant accounting policies. Those significant accounting policies detailed in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K did not change during the period from November 1, 2022 through January 31, 2023.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed and summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2023. Based on this evaluation process, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2023, and that there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Item 5. Other Information
At the end of December 2022, an office building and its contents at the Company’s Asheville facilities sustained water damage resulting from a burst pipe in the sprinkler system, likely due to extreme low temperatures in the area during the days leading up to the event. This office building is separate from the Company’s manufacturing building which houses its manufacturing operations and certain offices located at the same location. The Company has insurance coverage for the office building, its contents and certain business expenses to cover the losses incurred. There was no significant impact to the Company’s operations, and the overall impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows is not expected to be material since the proceeds of the insurance are expected to approximate the expenses incurred to repair or replace the assets damaged or destroyed. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded a loss on property and equipment totaling $8,000 and incurred expenses for building stabilization and cleaning, removal of damaged items, and other miscellaneous and related activities totaling $81,000. An offsetting amount of insurance proceeds receivable totaling $76,000, net of applicable deductibles, was recorded as of January 31, 2023.
