NORTH EUROPEAN OIL
ROYALTY TRUST
NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
(1)  Summary of significant accounting
policies:
Basis of accounting -
The accompanying financial
statements of North European Oil Royalty Trust (the "Trust") are prepared
in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
SEC.
Financial statement balances and financial results are
presented on a modified cash basis of accounting, which is a
comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP basis").
In the opinion
of management, all adjustments that are considered necessary for a fair
presentation of these financial statements, including adjustments of a
normal, recurring nature, have been included.
On a modified cash basis,
revenue is earned when cash is received and expenses are incurred
when cash is paid.
GAAP basis financial statements
disclose revenue as earned and expenses as incurred, without regard to
receipts or payments.
The modified cash basis of accounting is utilized
to permit the accrual for distributions to be paid to unit owners (those
distributions approved by the Trustees for the Trust).
The Trust's
distributable income represents royalty income received by the Trust
during the period plus interest income less any expenses incurred by the
Trust, all on a cash basis.
In the opinion of the Trustees, the use of
the modified cash basis of accounting provides a more meaningful
presentation to unit owners of the results of operations of the
Trust.
The results of any interim
period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for
the fiscal year.
These financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the financial statements that were included in the
Trust's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022
(the "2022 Form 10-K").
The Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Trust
Corpus included herein contain information from the Trust's 2022 Form
10-K.
Producing gas and oil royalty
rights -
The rights to certain gas and
oil royalties in Germany were transferred to the Trust at their net book
value by North European Oil Company (the "Company") (see Note 2). The
net book value of the royalty rights has been reduced to one dollar ($1)
in view of the fact that the remaining net book value of royalty
rights is de minimis relative to annual royalties received and
distributed by the Trust and does not bear any meaningful relationship
to the fair value of such rights or the actual amount of proved
producing reserves.
Federal and state
income taxes -
The Trust, as a grantor trust,
is exempt from federal income taxes under a private letter ruling
issued by the Internal Revenue Service.
The Trust has no state income
tax obligations.
Cash and cash equivalents -
Cash and cash equivalents are
defined as amounts deposited in bank accounts and amounts invested in
certificates of deposit and U. S. Treasury bills with original maturities
generally of three months or less from the date of purchase.
The
investment options available to the Trust are limited in accordance with
specific provisions of the Trust Agreement.
As of January 31, 2023, the
uninsured amount held in the Trust's U.S. bank accounts was $9,667,793.
In addition, the Trust held Euros 9,800, the equivalent of $10,641, in
its German bank account at January 31, 2023.
Net income per unit -
Net income per unit is based
upon the number of units outstanding at the end of the period.
As of both
January 31, 2023 and 2022, there were 9,190,590 units of beneficial interest
outstanding.
New accounting
pronouncements -
The Trust is not aware of any
recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards that would
be expected to have a significant impact on the Trust's financial position
or results of operations.
(2)  Formation of the Trust:
The Trust was formed on
September 10, 1975.
As of September 30, 1975, the Company was
liquidated and the remaining assets and liabilities of the
Company, including its royalty rights, were transferred to the Trust.
The
Trust, on behalf of the owners of beneficial interest in the Trust, holds
overriding royalty rights covering gas and oil production in certain
concessions or leases in the Federal Republic of Germany.
These rights
are held under contracts with local German exploration and development
subsidiaries of ExxonMobil Corporation and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of
Companies.
Under these contracts, the Trust receives various percentage
royalties on the proceeds of the sales of certain products from the
areas involved.
At the present time, royalties are received for sales
of gas well gas, oil well gas, crude oil, condensate and sulfur.
(3)  Related party transactions:
John R. Van Kirk, the Managing
Director of the Trust, is reimbursed by the Trust for office expenses at
cost.
For such office expenses, the Trust reimbursed the Managing
Director $1,603 and $1,926 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022,
respectively.
(4)  Employee benefit plan:
The Trust has established a
savings incentive match plan for employees (SIMPLE IRA) that is
available to both employees of the Trust, one of whom is the Managing
Director.
The Trustees have authorized the Trust to make contributions
to the accounts of the employees, on a matching basis, of up to 3% of
cash compensation paid to each employee for the 2023 and 2022
calendar years.
Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.
Executive Summary
The Trust is a passive fixed
investment trust which holds overriding royalty rights, receives income
under those rights from certain operating companies, pays its
expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unit owners.
As mandated by the Trust Agreement, distributions of income are made on
a quarterly basis.
These distributions, as determined by the Trustees,
constitute substantially all of the funds available after provision is
made for anticipated Trust expenses.
The Trust does not engage
in any business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas over
which it holds royalty rights and is precluded from engaging in such
activities by the Trust Agreement.
There are no requirements,
therefore, for capital resources with which to make capital
expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of royalty
revenues by the Trust.
The properties of the Trust,
which the Trust and Trustees hold pursuant to the Trust Agreement on
behalf of the unit owners, are overriding royalty rights on sales of gas,
sulfur and oil under a concession or leases in the Federal Republic of
Germany.
The actual concession or leases are held either by Mobil
Erdgas-Erdol GmbH ("Mobil Erdgas"), a German operating subsidiary of the
ExxonMobil Corporation ("ExxonMobil"), or by Oldenburgische
Erdolgesellschaft ("OEG").
As a result of direct and indirect ownership,
ExxonMobil owns two-thirds of OEG and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of
Companies owns one-third of OEG.
BEB Erdgas und Erdol GmbH ("BEB"), a
joint venture in which ExxonMobil and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group each
own 50%, administers the concession held by OEG.
The Oldenburg
concession is the primary area from which the natural gas, sulfur and
oil are extracted and currently provides 100% of all the royalties
received by the Trust.
The Oldenburg concession, at approximately
1,386,000 acres, covers virtually the entire former Grand Duchy of
Oldenburg and is located in the German federal state of Lower Saxony.
None of the leases are active or productive.
In 2002, Mobil Erdgas and
BEB Erdgas und Erdol GmbH ("BEB"), a joint venture of ExxonMobil and
the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies, formed a company, ExxonMobil
Production Deutschland GmbH ("EMPG"), to carry out all exploration,
drilling and production activities.
All sales activities are still
handled by the operating companies, either Mobil Erdgas or BEB.
The operating companies
pay monthly royalties to the Trust based on their sales of natural
gas, sulfur and oil. Of these three products, natural gas provided
approximately 99.10% of the cumulative royalty income received in
fiscal 2023.
The amount of royalties paid to the
Trust is primarily based on four factors: the amount of gas sold,
the price of that gas, the area from which the gas is sold and the
exchange rate.
On or about the 25th of
the months of January, April, July and October of each year, the
operating companies determine the amount of royalties that were
payable to the Trust based on applicable sales during the relevant
period.
This amount is paid out to the Trust in three monthly
installments as royalty payments (payable on or about the 15th of
each month) during its upcoming fiscal quarter.
In addition, the
operating companies review the actual amount of royalties that
were paid to the Trust for that period and calculate the difference
between the amounts paid and the amounts payable.
Any additional
amounts payable by the operating companies would be paid
immediately and any overpayment would be deducted from the payment
for the first month of the following fiscal quarter.
In September
of each year, the operating companies make the final determination
of any necessary underpayment or overpayment of royalties for the
prior calendar year.
The Trust's independent accountants based in
Germany review the royalty calculations on a biennial basis and
are scheduled to begin their examination for 2021 and 2022 in
November 2023.
There are two types of
natural gas found within the Oldenburg concession, sweet gas and
sour gas.
Sweet gas has little or no contaminants and needs very
minor treatment before it can be sold.
Sour gas, in comparison,
must be processed at the Grossenkneten desulfurization plant before
it can be sold.
The desulfurization process removes hydrogen
sulfide and other contaminants.
The hydrogen sulfide in gaseous
form is converted to sulfur in a solid form and sold separately.
With full operation of the plant, raw gas input capacity stands at
approximately 400 million cubic feet.
As needed, EMPG conducts
maintenance on the plant generally during the summer months when
demand is lower.
EMPG has indicated to the Trust's consultant in
Germany that it intends to shut down one of the remaining two units
in June 2023.
The retirement of this unit is planned by EMPG
because otherwise state authorities would mandate a full and costly
recertification of its vessels and pipes which will have reached
their required expiration date.
Since the units are roughly equal
in size, full operation of the remaining unit would be
approximately 200 MMcf per day following the shutdown.
It is
expected that the single unit will be sufficient to handle sour
gas production through-put from the concession.
It is also
expected that operating expenses in the future will be somewhat
reduced by this measure.
Since sour gas accounts for 75% of
overall gas sales and 98% of western gas sales, any future shutdown
could significantly impact royalty income. The Trust has
insufficient data to predict whether, when and to what extent any
future shutdown may occur.
Under one set of rights
covering the western part of the Oldenburg concession (approximately
662,000 acres), the Trust receives a royalty payment of 4% on gross
receipts from sales by Mobil Erdgas of gas well gas, oil well gas,
crude oil and condensate (the "Mobil Agreement").
Under the Mobil
Agreement, there is no deduction of costs prior to the calculation
of royalties from gas well gas and oil well gas, which together
accounted for 99.57% of the cumulative royalty income
received under this agreement in fiscal 2023.
Historically, the Trust has received significantly greater royalty
payments under the Mobil Agreement, as compared to the OEG Agreement
described below, due to the higher royalty rate specified by that
agreement.
The Trust is also entitled
under the Mobil Sulfur Agreement to receive a 2% royalty on gross
receipts of sales of sulfur obtained as a by-product of sour gas
produced from the western part of Oldenburg.
The payment of the
sulfur royalty is conditioned upon sales of sulfur by Mobil Erdgas
at a selling price above an agreed upon base price.
This base price
is adjusted annually by an inflation index.
In the first fiscal quarter of 2023, the Trust received no royalties under this agreement because prices were below the adjusted base price.
In the first quarter of
fiscal 2022, the Trust received $59,517 in sulfur royalties under
this agreement.
Under another set of
rights covering the entire Oldenburg concession and pursuant to
the agreement with OEG, the Trust receives royalties at the rate
of 0.6667% on gross receipts from sales by BEB of gas well gas,
oil well gas, crude oil, condensate and sulfur (removed during
the processing of sour gas) less a certain allowed deduction of
costs (the "OEG Agreement").
Under the OEG Agreement, 50% of the
field handling and treatment costs, as reported for state royalty
purposes, are deducted from the gross sales receipts prior to the
calculation of the royalty to be paid to the Trust.
In 2016, the Mobil and
OEG Agreements were amended, establishing a new base for the
determination of gas prices upon which the Trust's royalties are
calculated.
This change reflects a shift to the prices calculated
for the German Border Import gas Price ("GBIP").
The average GBIP
used under the Mobil and OEG Royalty Agreements has been and will
continue to be increased by 1% and 3%, respectively, for the royalty
calculations.
This change was intended to reduce the scope and cost
of the accounting examination, eliminate ongoing disputes with OEG
and Mobil regarding sales to related parties, and reduce prior year
adjustments to the normally scheduled year-end reconciliation.
The
pricing basis has eliminated certain costs (transportation and plant
gas storage), that were previously deductible prior to the royalty
calculation under the OEG Agreement.
For unit owners, changes
in the currency exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro
have an immediate impact. This impact occurs at the time the
royalties, which are paid to the Trust in Euros, are converted
into U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate and promptly
transferred from Germany to the Trust's bank account in the United
States.
In relation to the U.S. Dollar, a stronger Euro would
yield more U.S. Dollars and a weaker Euro would yield less U.S.
Dollars.
The Trust's consultant
in Germany provides general information to the Trust on the German
and European economies and energy markets as well as monitoring the
continuing impact of the war in Ukraine and ongoing efforts by the
European governments to respond to the economic impacts of the war.
This information provides a context in which to evaluate the
actions of the operating companies.
The Trust's consultant
receives reports from EMPG with respect to current and planned
drilling and exploration efforts.
For the time being, EMPG has not
scheduled any new gas well drilling through 2023.
EMPG and the
operating companies continue to limit the information flow to that
which is required by German law, and the Trust is not able to
confirm the accuracy of any of the information supplied by EMPG or
the operating companies.
The Trust had previously
disclosed that to the best of its knowledge the Farm-In Agreement
between Vermilion Energy Inc. ("Vermilion") and Mobil Erdgas and
BEB had expired due to Vermilion's failure to meet its drilling
commitments within the Oldenburg Concession.
Due to the efforts of
the Trust's consultant in Germany, the Trust was informed by EMPG
that Vermilion's drilling obligation in the Oldenburg area has been
halted for the time being due to difficulties obtaining the required
permits, and that Vermilion may or may not mature other prospects in
the central and northern parts of the Oldenburg Concession in the
future.
Results:
First Quarter of Fiscal 2023 versus
First Quarter of Fiscal 2022
Total royalty income
received during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was derived from
sales of gas, sulfur and oil from the Trust's overriding royalty
areas in Germany during the fourth calendar quarter of 2022.
The
distribution of $1.00 per unit was paid on February 28, 2023 to
owners of record as of February 17, 2023.
Comparisons of total
royalty income and net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2023
and 2022 are shown below.

Despite the lingering economic
effects caused by COVID-19 and the ongoing political and economic
consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the German energy market
was able, in the short-term, to address the energy shortfall caused by
the severe reduction in Russian exports to Germany.
This reduction in
supply resulted in an increased demand for gas from other sources in
order to provide sufficient gas supplies to get through the winter period
of peak demand.
The steps taken by Germany to stockpile sufficient gas
supplies resulted in the increase in gas prices for the August-October
2022 period used in this quarter's royalty calculation and led to the
increase in total royalty income between the first quarter of fiscal
2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
Total royalty income often
includes positive and negative adjustments that the operators made during
the quarter based upon their corrected royalty calculations for the prior
periods, as well as Mobil sulfur royalties.
In the first quarter of
fiscal 2023, total royalty income was not affected because there were no
prior period adjustments and there were no Mobil sulfur royalties.
In
the first quarter of fiscal 2022, total royalty income also was not
affected because there were no prior period adjustments but was
increased by Mobil sulfur royalties of $59,517.
The Trust's monthly royalty
payments are paid prospectively based on the amount of royalties payable
to the Trust in the prior quarter.
End of quarter royalty adjustments
result from the need to align prospective royalty payments from the
operating companies with actual royalties that should have been paid.
When actual prices and volumes are reported, there will be a positive
reconciliation in the current quarter or a negative reconciliation in the
subsequent quarter.
Primarily as a result of the recent decline in gas
prices, it is now anticipated that royalty payments to the Trust will be
subject to a negative adjustment in the third fiscal quarter
(May-July 2023). This will likely substantially reduce quarter-over-quarter
cash distributions to the unit owners for at least the third quarter.
The table below is intended to
illustrate trends based on actual gas sales in each quarter.
Gas royalties
shown in the table below are determined based on the actual physical gas
sales that occurred during the fourth calendar quarters of 2022 and 2021
and the average German Border Import gas Price for the periods of August
through October 2022 and 2021. No adjustments for prior periods are
reflected in the gas royalties.

Excluding the effects of
differences in prices and average exchange rates, the combination of
royalty rates on gas sold from western Oldenburg results in an effective
royalty rate approximately seven times higher than the royalty rate on
gas sold from eastern Oldenburg.
This is of particular significance to
the Trust since gas sold from western Oldenburg provides the bulk of
royalties paid to the Trust.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, gas
sales from western Oldenburg accounted for only 27.32% of all gas sales
from the Oldenburg concession.
However, royalties on these gas sales
provided approximately 73.11% or $7,075,967 out of a total of $9,677,986
in Oldenburg royalties attributable to gas.
Trust expenses for the first
quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 29.67%, or $57,835, to $252,792 from
$194,957 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
The increase in expenses
reflects increased Trustee fees as specified by the Trust Agreement,
increased fees associated with the Trust's petroleum consultant, and the
preparation and mailing of the annual meeting materials.
The current Statements of Assets,
Liabilities and Trust Corpus of the Trust at January 31, 2023, compared to
that at fiscal year-end (October 31, 2022), shows an increase in assets due
to higher royalty receipts during the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
This report on Form 10-Q may
contain forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe
harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995.
Such statements address future expectations and
events or conditions concerning the Trust.
Many of these statements
are based on information provided to the Trust by the operating
companies or by consultants using public information sources.
These
statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in
any forward-looking statements.
These include:
- risks and uncertainties concerning
levels of gas production and gas sale prices,   general economic
conditions and currency exchange rates;
- the ability or willingness of the
operating companies to perform under their   contractual
obligations with the Trust;
- potential disputes with the operating
companies and the resolution thereof; and
- political and economic uncertainty arising from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
All such factors are difficult
to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual
results, and are generally beyond the control of the Trust.
New factors
emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the Trust to predict
all such factors or to assess the impact of each such factor on the
Trust.
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on
which such statement is made, and the Trust does not undertake any
obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events
or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made.
Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk.
The Trust is a smaller
reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, and is not required to provide the information
required under this item.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.
The Trust maintains disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Trust is recorded, processed,
summarized, accumulated, and communicated to its management, which
consists of the Managing Director, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure, and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
forms.
The Managing Director has
performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures as of
January 31, 2023
based on the criteria for effective internal
control over financial reporting described in the standards
promulgated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and
the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on that evaluation, the Managing Director concluded that the
Trust's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
January 31, 2023.
There have been no changes in
the Trust's internal control over financial reporting identified in
connection with the evaluation described above that occurred during the
first quarter of fiscal 2023 that have materially affected or are
reasonably likely to materially affect the Trust's internal control
over financial reporting.
We are continually monitoring and assessing
the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact
on their design and operating effectiveness.
