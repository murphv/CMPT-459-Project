Nature and Continuance of Operations
Body and Mind Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on 5 November 1998 in the State of Delaware, USA, under the name Concept Development Group, Inc. In May 2004, the Company acquired  100 % of Vocalscape, Inc. and changed its name to Vocalscape, Inc. On October 28, 2005, the Company changed its name to Nevstar Precious Metals Inc. On October 23, 2008, the Company changed its name to Deploy Technologies Inc. (“Deploy Tech”) and, on September 15, 2010, the Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Deploy Acquisition Corp. (“Deploy”) under the laws of the State of Nevada, USA. On September 17, 2010, the Company merged with and into Deploy under the laws of the State of Nevada. Deploy, as the surviving corporation of the merger, assumed all the assets, obligations and commitments of Deploy Tech, and we were effectively re-domiciled in the State of Nevada. Upon the completion of the merger, Deploy assumed the name “Deploy Technologies Inc.”, and all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Deploy Tech was automatically converted into and became Deploy’s issued and outstanding common stock.   On 14 November 2017, the Company acquired Nevada Medical Group, LLC (“NMG”) and changed its name to Body and Mind Inc. The Company is now a supplier and grower of medical and recreational cannabis in the state of Nevada, and has retail operations in California, Ohio, Michigan and Arkansas.   Principles of Consolidation   These consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as follows:   Name   Jurisdiction   Ownership   Date of acquisition or formation DEP Nevada Inc.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13,
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after 15 December 2022. The Company does not anticipate this amendment to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.   The Company does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the consolidated financial position, statements of operations and cash flows.     7 Table of Contents   3.
Significant Accounting Policies   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.   Reclassification   Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of current period financial statements. These reclassifications had no effect on the previously reported net loss.   Basis of presentation   These condensed consolidated interim financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company’s fiscal year end is 31 July.   In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Company’s fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on 17 January 2023.   Accounts receivable   Amounts receivable represents amounts owed from customers for sale of medical and recreational cannabis and sales tax recoverable. Amounts are presented net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, which represents the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and current economic conditions. The Company reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis. As of 31 January 2023 and 31 July 2022, the Company has no allowance for doubtful accounts.   Revenue recognition   The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when our customers obtain control of our products. This determination is based on the customer specific terms of the arrangement for wholesale operations. Upon transfer of control, the Company has no further performance obligations. All retail sales are considered cash on delivery.   Due to the nature of the Company’s revenue from contracts with customers, the Company does not have material contract assets or liabilities that fall under the scope of ASC 606.   The Company’s revenues accounted for under ASC 606, generally, do not require significant estimates or judgments based on the nature of the Company’s revenue streams. The sales prices are generally fixed and all consideration from contracts is included in the transaction price. The Company’s contracts do not include multiple performance obligations or material variable consideration.   See Note 15 for revenue disaggregation table.     8 Table of Contents   Inventory and cost of goods sold   Inventory consists of work in progress (live plants and plants in the drying process), finished goods, and consumables. The Company values its finished goods and consumables at the lower of the actual costs or its current estimated market value less costs to sell. The Company values its work in progress at cost using the average cost method.   Costs incurred during the growing and production process are capitalized as incurred to the extent that cost is less than net realizable value. These costs include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead used in the growing and production processes. The Company capitalizes pre-harvest costs.   The Company periodically reviews its inventory for obsolete and potentially impaired items.  Any identified slow moving and obsolete items are written down to its net realizable value through a charge to cost of goods sold.  As of 31 January 2023 and 31 July 2022, the Company has no allowance for inventory obsolescence.   Cost of goods sold includes the costs directly attributable to product sales and includes amounts paid for finished goods, such as flower, edibles and concentrates, packaging and other supplies, fees for services and processing, and allocated overhead, such as allocations of rent, administrative salaries, utilities and related costs.   Loans receivable   The Company carries its loans receivable at cost and are reviewed for indicators of impairment at least annually.   Property and equipment   Property and equipment are stated at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis as follows:   Office equipment
7
years Cultivation equipment 7
years Production equipment 7
years Kitchen equipment 7
years Vehicles 7
years Vault equipment 7
years Leasehold improvements shorter of useful life or the term of the lease              Intangible assets   Intangible assets acquired from third parties are measured initially at fair value and either classified as indefinite life or finite life depending on their characteristics. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for indicators of impairment at least annually. The Company’s brands and licenses acquired from NMG have indefinite lives; therefore, no amortization is recognized. The Company’s brands and licenses acquired by NMG SD have a finite life of  10  years, brands and licenses acquired by NMG LB and NMG OH 1 have a finite life of  10  years, customer relationships acquired by NMG OH 1 have a finite life of five years, licenses acquired by Canopy have a finite life of  10  years and are amortized over these estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.  Brands acquired by Canopy have indefinite lives.     9 Table of Contents   Goodwill   Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in our business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations. The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, additional impairment testing is not required. The Company tests for goodwill impairment annually during its fourth quarter on 31 July.   Impairment of long-lived assets   The Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment and definite life intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the sum of projected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group.   Income taxes   Deferred income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the consolidated financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes”, which requires the use of the asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company provides for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards when realization is more likely than not.   The Company recognizes uncertain income tax positions at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Recognition or measurement is reflected in the period in which the likelihood changes. Any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax liabilities are presented within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.   Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share   The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share”. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excluded all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of 31 January 2023, potential common shares are comprised of
7,553,000
outstanding options,
33,215,284
outstanding warrants and
3,200,000
warrants held in escrow as described in Note 12 and Note 14 have been excluded from Diluted EPS.     10 Table of Contents   Comprehensive loss   ASC 220, “Comprehensive Income”, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income/loss and its components in the consolidated financial statements. As of 31 January 2023 and 31 July 2022, the Company reported foreign currency translation adjustments as other comprehensive income or loss and included a schedule of comprehensive income/loss in the consolidated financial statements.   Foreign currency translation   The Company’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar and its reporting currency is in U.S. dollars. The Company’s subsidiaries have a functional currency in U.S. dollars. The consolidated financial statements of the Company are translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830, “Foreign Currency Matters”. Exchange gains and losses on inter-company balances that form part of the net investment in foreign operations are included in other comprehensive income. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. The exchange rates used to translate Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar was
0.7491
for monetary assets and liabilities and
0.7470
as an average rate for transactions occurred during the period ended 31 January 2023. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of net loss.   Stock-based compensation   The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. The fair value determined represents the cost for the award and is recognized over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. The Company’s accounting policy is to recognize forfeitures as they occur.   Fair value measurements   The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:     · Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.         · Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies.         · Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in other private entities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.
The Company measures equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.
The convertible loan receivable was valued using Level 3 inputs.   Other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.     11 Table of Contents   Use of estimates and assumptions   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.   Lease accounting   Under ASC 842, leases are separated into two classifications: operating leases and financial leases. Lease classification under ASC 842 is relatively similar to ASC 840. For a lease to be classified as a finance lease, it must meet one of the five finance lease criteria: (1) transference of title/ownership to the lessee, (2) purchase option, (3) lease term for major part of the remaining economic life of the asset, (4) present value represents substantially all of the fair value of the asset, and (5) asset specialization. Any lease that does not meet these criteria is classified as an operating lease. ASC 842 requires all leases to be recognized on the Company’s balance sheet. Specifically, for operating leases, the Company recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability upon lease commitment.   Non-controlling Interest   Non-controlling interests (“NCI”) represent equity interests owned by outside parties. NCI may be initially measured at fair value or at the NCI’s proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. The Company has elected to measure each NCI at its proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The share of net assets attributable to NCI are presented as a component of equity. NCI's share of net income or loss is recognized directly in equity. Total income or loss of subsidiaries is attributed to the shareholders of the Company and to the NCI, even if this results in the NCI having a deficit balance.   4. Financial Instruments   The following table represents the Company’s assets that are measured at fair value as of 31 January 2023 and 31 July 2022:       As of 31 January
2023     As of 31 July  2022   Financial assets at fair value             Cash   $ 3,157,753     $ 1,854,277   Convertible loan receivable     1,250,000       1,250,000                     Total financial assets at fair value   $ 4,407,753     $ 3,104,277     Management of financial risks   The financial risk arising from the Company’s operations include credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk. These risks arise from the normal course of operations and all transactions undertaken are to support the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The risks associated with these financial instruments and the policies on how to mitigate these risks are set out below. Management manages and monitors these exposures to ensure appropriate measures are implemented on a timely and effective manner.   Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Company reduces its exposure to credit risk by maintaining its cash with major financial institutions. Credit risk associated with the convertible loans receivable arises from the possibility that the principal and/or interest due may become uncollectible. The Company mitigates this risk by managing and monitoring the underlying business relationship.     12 Table of Contents   Liquidity risk   Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company ensures, as far as reasonably possible, that it will have sufficient capital in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and the Company’s holdings of cash. The Company had working capital deficit of $ 368,804
at 31 January 2023 and the Company required additional financing to meet all current and future financial obligations which caused substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. The Company anticipates that cash on hand and working capital will ensure coverage for all expenses associated with current operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of these financial statements.  Management believes that the Company has access to capital resources through potential public or private issuances of debt or equity securities to further contribute to the growth.   Interest rate risk   Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company is not exposed to interest rate risk as it does not hold financial instruments that will fluctuate in value due to changes in interest rates.   Currency risk   Currency risk is the risk that the fair values of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because they are denominated in currencies that differ from the respective functional currency. The Company is exposed to currency risk by incurring expenditures and holding assets denominated in currencies other than its functional currency.   5 .

Convertible loan receivable   Effective March 15, 2019, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, DEP Nevada and NMG, entered into a convertible loan agreement and a management agreement with Comprehensive Care Group LLC (“CCG”), an Arkansas limited liability company, with respect to the development of a medical cannabis dispensary facility in West Memphis, Arkansas. The convertible loan agreement can be extended by either party and the current agreement has a maturity date of 30 March 2023. Under no circumstances the maturity date of the convertible loan agreement shall extend beyond the expiration of the management agreement as described below.    Pursuant to the management agreement, NMG will provide operations and management services, including management, staffing, operations, administration, oversight, and other related services. Under the management agreement, NMG will be required to obtain approval from CCG for any key decisions as defined in the agreement and accordingly the Company does not control CCG. NMG will be paid a monthly management fee equal to  66.67 % of the monthly net profits of CCG, subject to conversion of the convertible loan as discussed below upon which the monthly management fee shall be $ 6,000  per month, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. The management agreement has an expiration of
15 March 2024
and can be mutually extendable.   The convertible loan agreement is for an amount up to $ 1,250,000  from DEP to CCG with proceeds to be used to fund construction of a facility, working capital and initial operating expenses. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of $ 6,000  per month until the parties mutually agree to increase the interest. Upon the latter of one year of granting of a medical cannabis dispensary license by the appropriate authorities or one year after entering into the convertible loan agreement, DEP may elect to convert the loan into preferred units of CCG equal to  40 % of all outstanding preferred units of CCG that carry
66.7 % voting interest, subject to approval of the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission.     13 Table of Contents   The Company had advanced $ 1,250,000  (31 July 2022 - $ 1,250,000 ) at 31 January 2023, and accrued interest income of $ 18,000
(2022 - $ 18,000 ) and $ 36,000
(2022 - $ 36,000 ) for the three and six months ended 31 January 2023, respectively. As of 31 January 2023, total interest receivable was $ 258,000  (31 July 2022 - $ 222,000 ).   The Company evaluated the convertible loan receivable’s settlement provisions and elected the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825 “Financial Instruments”, to value this instrument. Under such election, the loan receivable is measured initially and subsequently at fair value, with any changes in the fair value of the instrument being recorded in the consolidated financial statements as a change in fair value of the financial instruments. The Company estimates the fair value of this instrument by first estimating the fair value of the straight debt portion, excluding the embedded conversion option, using a discounted cash flow model. The Company then estimates the fair value of the embedded conversion option using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.
The discounted cash flow model for the straight debt portion uses four different scenarios as follows:  The Company discounts the principal amount of $ 1,250,000 , monthly interest payment of $ 6,000
using these
four different maturity dates: (1) March 30, 2024, (2) March 30, 2025, (3) March 30, 2026 and (4) March 30, 2027, whereby each scenario is given 25% probability of occurring since the actual conversion date is uncertain .  The discount rate used is
22.92 %.   The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model for the conversion option are as follows: (i) equity price of $ 30,168
per unit calculated as BAM’s portion of the future projected profits, on a per unit basis, discounted using Weighted Average Cost of Capital of
15 %; (ii) exercise price of $ 31,250
per unit as there are 40 units in total, (iii) volatility of
88 % using BAM as benchmark, (iv) expected life of
2.70
years and (v) risk-free rate of
4.10 %.   The sum of these two valuation models resulted in an estimated fair value of the loan receivable balance of $1,250,000 as of 31 January 2023.   7 . Loan receivable   In addition to the convertible loan receivable (Note 6), the Company provides operating loans to CCG that are non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on demand. During the six months ended 31 January 2023, the Company advanced $ 645,092
(2022 - $ 655,969 ) to CCG and received repayments totaling $ 1,194,025
(2022 - $ 450,000 ) for a net decrease in loan receivable of
548,933
(2022 – net increase of $ 205,969 ). At 31 January 2023, the amount receivable from CCG was $ 241,051
(31 July 2022 - $ 789,984 ).     14 Table of Contents   8. Property and Equipment

Acquisitions   Canopy Monterey Bay, LLC   On 30 November 2021, the Company entered into two definitive agreements with Canopy Monterey Bay, LLC (“Canopy”) and the membership interest owners (the “Sellers”) of Canopy to acquire an aggregate of  100 % of Canopy, which owns a retail dispensary in the limited license jurisdiction of Seaside, California, to expand our retail operations.   The first purchase agreement (“PA #1”) between DEP and Canopy and all of the Sellers provides for the assignment of 80% of the membership interests of Canopy to DEP in exchange for a purchase price of $ 4,800,000
comprised of $ 2,500,000  in cash (the “Cash Purchase Price”) and a secured promissory note in the amount of $ 2,300,000  bearing interest at a rate of 10% per annum compounded annually and having a maturity date of five years from the effective date of PA #1. Interest is payable for the first 6 months with the principal and accrued interest due at maturity. There are no prepayment penalties. The Cash Purchase Price is to be paid into escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement between the parties to PA #1 and Secured Trust Escrow, which Cash Purchase Price is to be released to the Sellers upon the receipt of city and state approval and completion of the audited annual financial statements (the “Financial Statements”) of Canopy, or returned to DEP in the event of the denial of city or state approval or failure to complete the Financial Statements and the agreement is terminated, in which case the  80 % membership interests will be transferred back to the Sellers and the promissory note will automatically be terminated.   The second purchase agreement (“PA #2”) between DEP and the one continuing Seller provides for the assignment of the remaining  20 % of the membership interests of Canopy to DEP following the receipt of the city and state approval and completion of the Financial Statements under PA #1 in exchange for $ 1,000,000  to be paid in either shares of common stock of the Company (the “Consideration Shares”) or in cash at DEP’s sole option if such payment takes place within six (6) months following the execution of PA #1. If DEP elects to pay the purchase price in Consideration Shares, the amount of Consideration Shares shall be determined based on the 10 day volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) ending on 30 November 2021, which is US$ 0.3665  per share for a total of  2,728,156  shares (issued) (Note 14). In the event that six (6) months following the execution of PA #1, the value of the Consideration Shares have decreased such that total value of the Consideration Shares is less than ninety percent (90%) of its value, DEP agrees to cause the Company to issue an additional $ 100,000  worth of shares of common stock of the Company (the “Additional Shares”) to be issued to the one continuing Seller based on the ten day VWAP calculated as of six (6) months following the closing of PA #1. This was included as contingent consideration in the purchase price and $100,000 was recorded in accounts payable at 31 July 2022. PA #2 contains a working capital adjustment provision, which provides that if there is a working capital deficiency as of the closing date of PA #1, then the purchase price under PA #2 shall be reduced by the amount of the deficiency, and if there is a working capital surplus as of the closing date of PA #1, then the purchase price under PA #2 shall be increased by the amount of the surplus.   On or around 1 December 2021, 80% of the membership interests of Canopy were transferred to DEP for purposes of applying for city and state approvals of the change in ownership of Canopy, however, the purchase price consideration of (i) $2.5 million in cash, and (ii) a promissory note in the amount of $2.3 million to be paid by DEP, were placed in escrow and not to be released to the sellers of the 80% membership interests in Canopy until the city and state approvals have been received and the Financial Statements of Canopy are completed. If the city or state approvals are not received, or the Financial Statements of Canopy are not completed, then the Buyer may terminate the membership interest purchase agreement requiring the membership interests in Canopy to be transferred back to the sellers and the escrow agent to deliver back to DEP the cash consideration and the promissory note shall automatically be terminated.     16 Table of Contents   On 17 June 2022, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, DEP Nevada, Inc., entered into the first amendment to PA #1 and PA #2 (the “First Amendment”) whereby the cash purchase price under PA #1 will be reduced from $2.5 million to $1.25 million and the Company will issue $1.25 million in shares of common stock of the Company to the Sellers based on the 10 day volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) for the ten (10) consecutive trading days prior to the effective date of the
First Amendment (the “Effective Date”) and subject to compliance with the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”), which equates to 9,328,358 shares of common stock. The Company will also issue additional shares to Cary Stiebel equal to the difference between the amount of the shares of common stock of the Company that were issued by the Company to Mr. Stiebel on December 3, 2021 (the “PA #2 Shares”) and the amount of shares that Mr. Stiebel would have received had the VWAP for the PA #2 Shares been calculated as of the Effective Date (the “Additional PA #2 Shares”) which equates to 4,734,530 shares of common stock. Additionally, on the date that is eighteen (18) months (548 days) following the Effective Date of this First Amendment (the “Additional Share Issuance Date”) the Company will issue $100,000 worth of shares to the Sellers based on the ten (10) day VWAP and subject to compliance with the policies of the CSE, calculated as of the Additional Share Issuance Date. This $100,000 was recorded as consulting fees for the year ended 31 July 2022. Furthermore, DEP shall cause the Company to issue to Mr. Stiebel $300,000 worth of shares of common stock of the Company within six (3) days following the Effective Date of this First Amendment, and subject to compliance with the policies of the CSE (the “Additional True up Shares”) which equates to 2,238,806 shares of common stock .

In the event Schedule D to the First Amendment is not completed, executed and delivered to DEP prior to the conclusion of the calculation of the actual working capital, DEP shall have no obligation to retitle the shares and all Sellers hereby waive any claims against DEP and the Company in connection with such issuance made in accordance with Section 2(b)(v) of the First Amendment. Upon conclusion of the calculation of the actual working capital in accordance with PA #1 and PA #2, the parties agree as follows:   (a) If the actual working capital is less than the target working capital of $nil, the Purchase Price (as defined in PA #2) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the target working capital and the actual working capital and all of the Additional True-up Shares shall be forfeited and retuned to Company for cancellation;   (b) If the actual working capital is greater than the target working capital of $nil and the Additional True-up Shares are sufficient to cover the difference between the actual working capital and the target working capital (the “DEP Deficit”), the parties agree that all or a portion of the Additional True-up Shares (valued at the ten (10) day VWAP calculated as of the Effective Date of the First Amendment and subject to compliance with the policies of the CSE) shall be issued to Sellers to satisfy the DEP Deficit owed by DEP to the Sellers in accordance with Section 2.02(b) of PA #2;   (c) If the actual working capital is greater than the target working capital and the Additional True-up Shares are insufficient to cover the DEP Deficit, all of the Additional True-up Shares shall be issued to Sellers and the parties agree that any additional amounts owed to the Sellers shall be paid by DEP to the Sellers via additional shares of common stock of the Company.   In addition to the terms of the First Amendment, the parties have agreed that the release of any Additional True-up Shares hereunder shall be subject to the Sellers providing written direction to DEP for the release of the Additional True-up Shares payable under the First Amendment.   On December 7, 2022, pursuant to the previously announced (i) membership interest purchase agreement (“MIPA #1”), dated November 30, 2021, as amended on June 17, 2022, entered into between the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, DEP Nevada, Inc.

per share.  2,238,806 of the 16,301,694 shares are being held in escrow pending the results of a working capital adjustment in accordance with MIPA #1 and MIPA #2.   The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. For accounting purposes, the acquisition date is the date that the Company obtained full control over the operations, although not all conditions for closing the acquisition had occurred as of 1 December 2021. The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, which were recorded as of the acquisition date, as well as the aggregate consideration for the acquisition of Canopy made by the Company:   Purchase consideration

(“DEP”), BaM Body and Mind Dispensary NJ Inc., a New Jersey corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of DEP (the “Merger Sub”), CraftedPlants NJ Corp., a New Jersey corporation (the “Surviving Entity”) and those certain shareholders of the Surviving Entity (the “Sellers”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) whereby the Merger Sub merged with and into the Surviving Entity, and following the consummation of the merger, which occurred on December 21, 2022, the Surviving Entity became a wholly owned subsidiary of DEP and changed its name to BaM Body and Mind Dispensary NJ, Inc. (the “Merged Entity”).
CraftedPlants NJ Corp. had a lease in Lawrenceville, New Jersey that was already zoned for cannabis retail store.  There is no operational history for CraftedPlants NJ Corp. and is essentially comprised of one operating lease asset.  The lease agreement does not include any provision that would revoke the approval for a cannabis retail store in a change of ownership of CraftedPlants NJ.  Management is not aware of any laws and regulations that would revoke the zoning approval upon change of ownership. The purpose of the merger is expansion into the New Jersey adult use market through merging with an entity with a lease in New Jersey with local preapproval for an adult use cannabis location.  The compensation for merger is contingent on success milestones including granting of pending license approval from the State of New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission and opening of the business as a recreational cannabis dispensary.
The Company also entered into a three-year strategic advisory services agreement with Bengal Impact Partners, LLC (“Bengal Capital”) dated 5 January 2023 (“Bengal Advisory Agreement”). The Company shall pay Bengal Capital $240,000 on each anniversary, of which $60,000 is to be paid in cash and $180,000 is to be paid in cash, common stock, or warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, in such proportions as are determined by the Company. In addition, if the Company successfully obtains a cultivation license in New Jersey during the term of the Bengal Advisory Agreement, the Company will owe a fee of $1,000,000, which will be payable in the form of the Company’s common stock or a warrant to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, in either case as requested by Bengal Capital .   Bengal Catalyst Funds and CraftedPlants NJ Corp were both owned or managed by the principals of the Bengal Capital Group and Bengal Catalyst Fund also participated in the 19 December 2022 convertible debenture financings (Note 12). Joshua Rosen is a managing principal of the Bengal Capital Group and he was involved in both transactions of the convertible note investment and the merger acquisition of Crafted Plants NJ Corp. Joshua Rosen was appointed as a director of the Company effective 1 February 2023.   Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on the closing DEP delivered a cash payment of $ 50,000
to the Sellers, with a delayed payment of approximately $ 120,000
to be paid to the Sellers upon funding of the project buildout which is anticipated to occur after receipt of the New Jersey state license and local construction approvals.   Further, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on December 21, 2022, the Company issued to the Sellers an aggregate of
16,666,667
shares of its common stock (the “Merger Consideration Shares”).  The Merger Consideration Shares will be held in escrow and will not be released to the Sellers until the Surviving Entity achieves certain milestones, however, the Sellers will still maintain the voting and participation rights with respect to the Merger Consideration Shares while being held in escrow.  The post-closing milestones are as follows:   1. If, within two (2) years of the closing date, the Surviving Entity’s application is approved and is granted pending license approval from the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission (the “CRC”), 70% of the Merger Consideration Shares will be release from escrow.     2. If, within three (3) years of the closing date, the Surviving Entity opens for business as a recreational cannabis dispensary, 30% of the Merger Consideration Shares will be released from escrow.
19 Table of Contents   If either or both of the milestones are not achieved within the time periods after the closing date (the “Milestone Dates”), the Company shall have the option to cancel the Merger Consideration Shares attributable to the failed milestone by delivering written notice to Sellers and in the event of such cancellation, the portion of the Merger Consideration Shares attributable to the failed milestone shall be surrendered and cancelled without any further action required by the parties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either or both of the milestones are not achieved (or if it becomes obvious that they will not be achieved) by their respective Milestone Dates because of delays that are not caused by the Sellers, the Sellers may, before the applicable Milestone Dates, provide notice to the Company, and the applicable Milestone Date will be extended to such date as is reasonably necessary for the milestone to be achieved.  The parties will work together in mutual good faith to determine the dates by when the milestones can be reasonably achieved. If the Company fails to diligently pursue issuance of the state recreational licenses at any time prior to the second anniversary, and the Company fails to cure such failures in accordance with the Merger Agreement, the Company will owe to Sellers a termination fee equal to 25% of the Merger Consideration Shares.
The likelihood of achieving both milestones is uncertain at this time and, as such, the Company recorded the Merger Consideration Shares at par value.   The acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition since the Surviving Entity did not meet the definition of a business in accordance with ASC 805, as it had no outputs and did not have a substantive process that could significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.  In accordance with ASC 805-50 and measurement of share-based payment in ASC 718, the acquisition should be measured on the date on which the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree. The date on which the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree generally is the date on which the acquirer legally transfers the consideration, acquires the assets, and assumes the liabilities of the acquiree.   The Company obtained
100 % ownership and control over the Merged Entity and the lease asset on 21 December 2022.  The purchase price, as measured on 21 December 2022, was $ 175,000
which was included in the lease liability and right-of-use assets calculation for the lease acquired in the State of New Jersey (see Note 13).

Focus Growth loan   On 19 July 2021, the Company entered into and closed a loan agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with FG Agency Lending LLC (the “Agent”) and Bomind Holdings LLC (the “Lender”). Upon entering into the Loan Agreement, the Lender provided the initial term loan (the “Initial Term Loan”) in the face amount of $ 6,666,667
of which $ 6,000,000
was advanced to the Company with the
10 % representing an origination discount as consideration for the use or forbearance of money.
The Company may draw upon the remaining face amount of $4,444,444 (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan”) upon providing a 30-day request to the Agent by 1 December 2021, whereby $4,000,000 will be advanced to the Company after applying the 10% origination discount . The Initial Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Term Loan mature on 19 July 2025 and bear interest at a rate of
13 % per annum payable on the first day of each month hereafter.   Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Company issued an aggregate of
8,000,000
common stock purchase warrants (each, a “Warrant”) to the Agent of which (i)
4,800,000
Warrants will entitle the holder to acquire shares of common stock (each, a “Warrant Share”) at an exercise price of $ 0.40
per Warrant Share until July 19, 2025, and (ii)
3,200,000
Warrants will be held in escrow by us and released to the Agent at the time the Company draws on the Delayed Draw Term Loan, or cancelled if we do not draw on the Delayed Draw Term Loan, which will entitle the holder to acquire a Warrant Share at an exercise price of $ 0.45
per Warrant Share until
July 19, 2025 .   The Company also paid agent fees, legal fees and other fees in the amount of $ 175,758 . The
4,800,000
Warrants had a relative fair value of $ 1,037,146
and when combined with the $ 175,758
in fees and the $666,667 origination discount, resulted in a debt discount of $ 1,883,901 .   The Initial Term Loan is secured by certain of the Company’s assets, equity interest in subsidiaries and various agreements, under the Security Agreement, the Pledge Agreement and the Omnibus Collateral Assignment.
On 15 June 2022,
the Company entered into a second amendment to the Loan Agreement (“Amendment No. 2 to Loan Agreement”) to extend the maturity date by one year to 19 July 2026. Additionally, Amendment No. 2 to Loan Agreement allows the outside date for the Company to draw on the delayed draw term loan of US$4.44 million to be extended from June 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023, whereby US$4 million in funds will be advanced to the Company. The ability of the Company to draw on the delayed draw term loan is subject to compliance with certain provisions in Loan Agreement including provision of a satisfactory budget approved at the sole discretion of the Lender. The Amendment No. 2 to Loan Agreement increases the interest rate on the advanced funds from 13% to 15% per annum, which additional 2% interest may be paid in kind, with the interest being payable on the first day of each month. Amendment No. 2 to Loan Agreement provides for an exit fee equal to 1.5% of the principal balance, which is due and payable upon any payment, in part or in full, of the initial term loan and the delayed draw term loan . As partial consideration for Amendment No. 2 to Loan Agreement, the Company has issued  1,000,000  common stock purchase warrants (each, a “Warrant”) to the Lender. Each Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one share of common stock (each, a “Warrant Share”) at an exercise price of US$ 0.16  per Warrant Share until June 14, 2027.     22 Table of Contents   The Amendment No. 2 to Loan Agreement was accounted for as a modification consistent with ASC 470-50,
Debt Modification, where the lender fees, including 1,000,000 additional common stock purchase warrants valued at $79,585 and the exit fee of $100,000, are capitalized as additional debt discount and amortized as par to the effective yield .
On December 12, 2022, the Company, the Guarantors (collectively, the “Loan Parties”) the Agent and the Lender entered into a Limited Waiver and Amendment to Loan Agreement (the “Limited Waiver and Amendment to Loan Agreement”) to deal with certain events of default that occurred under the Loan Agreement, as amended, with respect to (i) the Company’s failure to deliver to Agent the audited annual financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, on or before ninety (90) days after the end of such fiscal year in accordance with Section 7.2(c) of the Loan Agreement (the “First Specified Default”) and (ii) the Agent being informed that the Company anticipates that it will fail to deliver the quarterly financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2022, in form and substance acceptable to Agent, on or before forty-five (45) days after the end of such fiscal quarter, in accordance with Section 7.2(b) (the “Second Specified Default”, and together with the First Specified Default, the “Specified Defaults”).    Pursuant to the Limited Waiver and Amendment to Loan Agreement, the Agent and the Lender each waive the Specified Defaults on a limited one-time basis subject to the terms and conditions thereof until (i) with respect to the First Specified Default, 5:00 PM EST on December 30, 2022, and (ii) with respect to the Second Specified Default, 5:00 PM EST on January 13, 2023 (the “Waiver Period”); provided that if the Loan Parties do not deliver each of the Amended Deliverables (as defined below) on or before expiration of their respective Waiver Period; the waiver shall no longer be of any effect, and the Lender shall be entitled to enforce all remedies set forth in the Loan Agreement as of the date each Specified Default first occurred.   Subsequent to entering into the Limited Waiver and Amendment to Loan Agreement, the parties verbally agreed and confirmed via email on December 20, 2022, that Waiver Period for the First Specified Default shall be extended from December 30, 2022 to January 17, 2023, and the Waiver Period for the Second Specified Default shall be extended from January 13, 2023 to January 27, 2023; and that the corresponding amendments shall be made to sections 7.2(b) and 7.2(c) of the Loan Agreement as set forth in the Limited Waiver and Amendment to Loan Agreement.   During the six months ended 31 January 2023, the Company recorded $ 248,423

Our platform approach to expansion focuses on limited license states and jurisdictions, entering new markets through lower cost license applications and opportunistic/targeted acquisitions.   We have developed the marquis lifestyle “Body and Mind” brand in Nevada with strong penetration into dispensaries and have recently expanded our brand and products to dispensaries in California. The Body and Mind brand appeals to a wide range of cannabis consumers with products including flower, oils, extracts (wax, live resin, ambrosia) and edibles.   We have a track record of producing award-winning cannabis products and we have success with winning licenses in new states and jurisdictions.
We are a Nevada corporation that, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Nevada Medical Group, LLC (“ NMG ”), are engaged in the cultivation and production of medical and adult-use recreational marijuana products. NMG produces cannabis flower, oil extracts and edibles under license in the state of Nevada, which are available for sale under the brand name “Body and Mind” in dispensaries in Nevada.    In April 2020, we closed the San Diego ShowGrow dispensary transaction, which is owned 60% by our wholly-owned subsidiary, NMG San Diego, LLC (“ NMG SD ”), and has received all licenses, permits and authorizations required to conduct medical and adult-use commercial cannabis retail operations. The San Diego ShowGrow dispensary opened in early July 2020. We, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NMG Long Beach, LLC (“ NMG LB ”), have been managing the Long Beach dispensary operations, received all approvals and final license transfer for the dispensary, which was transferred to NMG LB at the end of August 2020 and is expected to close in the near future.
35 Table of Contents   On July 11, 2021, we announced receipt of local approval for a cannabis manufacturing facility in Cathedral City, California and execution of a lease for the facility. We have applications in process with the California Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) for a type “N” manufacturing license, and with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) for a distribution license, which is anticipated to allow us to manufacture and distribute our BaM branded flower products, extracts, oils and edibles. The Company has received state and local approvals to advance the manufacturing facility and is evaluating the expansion opportunity.   On November 30, 2021, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, DEP Nevada, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“ DEP ”) entered into two membership interest purchase agreements with Canopy Monterey Bay, LLC (“ Canopy ”) and the membership interest owners of Canopy to acquire an aggregate of 100% of Canopy, which owns a retail dispensary in the limited license jurisdiction of Seaside, California, called “The Reef.” The Company through DEP completed the acquisition of all of the membership interests of Canopy on December 7, 2022.   In Ohio, we, through NMG, were managing the fully operational The Clubhouse dispensary located in Elyria, Ohio, which was owned by NMG Ohio LLC, of which we owned 30% through our subsidiary NMG, and had an agreement to acquire the remaining 70% of NMG Ohio LLC. We received all approvals and final license and name transfer from the Ohio Department of Pharmacy in early September 2020 and transferred the dispensary license and all assets and liabilities associated with such dispensary from NMG Ohio LLC to a 100% owned subsidiary of Body and Mind; however, the transfer of the remaining 70% interest in NMG Ohio LLC to NMG did not occur until NMG Ohio LLC received a production license. On September 17, 2021, the final award of the production license was transferred to our wholly owned subsidiary, NMG OH P1 LLC, and the transaction closed resulting in NMG now owning 100% of NMG Ohio.   In Arkansas, we, through NMG, manage the “Body and Mind” branded medical marijuana dispensary including cultivation in West Memphis, Arkansas. The dispensary opened on April 27, 2020 and the cultivation commenced operations on April 6, 2021. On October 28, 2020, the dispensary was awarded best dispensary in Arkansas by Ark420.com.   In Michigan we, through NMG MI 1, Inc. opened a retail location in Muskegon Michigan on February 2, 2022 and operate the dispensary as a Body and Mind branded dispensary. On September 21, 2021 we announced the Company has leased a commercial building in Manistee, MI with the intent of developing a cultivation facility with 50,000 square feet of canopy as well as a production facility. On April 7, 2022 the Company announced it would pause development of the cultivation and production developments. The Company continues to evaluate the projects.
On December 21, 2022, the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary, DEP, BaM Body and Mind Dispensary NJ Inc., a New Jersey corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of DEP (the “ Merger Sub ”), CraftedPlants NJ Corp., a New Jersey corporation ( “ CraftedPlants ”) and certain shareholders of the CraftedPlants entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger whereby Merger Sub merged with and into CraftedPlants, and following the consummation of the merger, which occurred on December 21, 2022, CraftedPlants, as the surviving entity of the merger, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of DEP and changed its name to BaM Body and Mind Dispensary NJ, Inc. BaM Body and Mind Dispensary NJ, Inc. leases a New Jersey retail location with local cannabis-use approval, and is currently working on attaining final state licensure in New Jersey.   Our common stock is listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the symbol “BAMM” and our common stock is posted for trading on the OTCQB Venture Market under the symbol “BMMJ.”

Business Operations   Development of Our Business   Incorporation and Early Corporate History   We were incorporated on November 5, 1998 in the State of Delaware under the name Concept Development Group, Inc. In May 2004, we acquired 100% of Kaleidoscope Venture Capital, Inc. (formerly Vocalscape Networks, Inc.) and changed our name to Vocalscape, Inc. In November 2005, we changed our name to Nevstar Precious Metals Inc. In September 2008, we changed our name to Deploy Technologies Inc. (“ Deploy Tech ”) and effective November 14, 2017, we changed our name to Body and Mind, Inc. (“ Body and Mind ”).   On September 15, 2010, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Deploy Acquisition Corp. (“ Deploy ”) under the laws of the State of Nevada, USA. On September 17, 2010, Deploy completed a merger with Deploy Tech, its former parent company, pursuant to which Deploy was the surviving corporation and assumed all the assets, obligations and commitments of Deploy Tech. Upon the completion of the merger Deploy assumed the name “Deploy Technologies Inc.” and all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Deploy Tech was automatically converted into and became Deploy’s – that is, our Company’s issued and outstanding common stock.     37 Table of Contents   On May 10, 2011, we registered as an extra-provincial company in British Columbia, and on September 30, 2011, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to designate 2,900,000 shares of our authorized capital stock as Class A Preferred Shares (the “ Preferred Shares ”). On September 2, 2014, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State increasing the authorized Preferred Shares from 2,900,000 shares to 20,000,000 shares.   On November 11, 2014, we filed a certificate of change with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby we reverse split our authorized as well as the issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “ Common Shares ”) on the basis of one (1) new share for ten (10) old shares. This resulted in a reduction of our authorized capital from 100,000,000 Common Shares to 10,000,000 Common Shares, and a reduction of our issued and outstanding Common Shares from 23,130,209 Common Shares to approximately 2,313,021 Common Shares. On April 11, 2017, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to increase the authorized capital from 10,000,000 Common Shares to 900,000,000 Common Shares.   Acquisition of Nevada Medical Group, LLC   On September 14, 2017, we, with DEP, entered into a definitive agreement (the “ Share Exchange Agreement ”) with Nevada Medical Group, LLC (“ NMG ”), whereby DEP acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of NMG in exchange for (a) 16,000,000 post reverse-split Common Shares, (b) $2,000,000 cash, and (b) promissory notes (the “ Promissory Notes ”) in the aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000, to the NMG securityholders on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective ownership interest in NMG. The Promissory Notes were secured by a senior priority security interest in all of our assets, and were due to be repaid at the earlier of fifteen (15) months from the closing date of the Share Exchange Agreement, or, if an equity or debt financing subsequent to the Concurrent Financing (as defined below) were to be closed in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000, then within 30 days of the closing date of such subsequent financing. The Share Exchange Agreement closed on November 14, 2017.   Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we changed our name to “Body and Mind, Inc.”, effective on November 14, 2017, by filing a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State; at the same time, we cancelled our entire authorized class of Preferred Shares. In addition, on November 14, 2017, we filed a certificate of change with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby we reverse split our issued and outstanding Common Shares on the basis of one (1) new share for three (3) old shares (the “ Consolidation ”) which resulted in there being 28,239,876 Common Shares issued and outstanding post-Consolidation. Subsequent to completion of the Share Exchange Agreement, we filed articles of exchange with the Nevada Secretary of State.   Concurrent with the Share Exchange Agreement, we completed an equity financing to raise aggregate gross proceeds of CAD$6,007,430 through the issuance of subscription receipts (the “ Subscription Receipts ”), at a pre-Consolidation price of CAD$0.22 per Subscription Receipt (the “ Concurrent Financing ”). On November 14, 2017, each Subscription Receipt was exchanged in accordance with its terms, for no additional consideration, for one pre-Consolidation Common Share and one common share purchase warrant (each a “ Warrant ”) of the Company. Each Warrant was exercisable by the holder at a price of CAD$0.90 for a period of 24 months from the date of issuance.   On completion of the Share Exchange Agreement, we assumed the business of NMG, being the cultivation and production of medical marijuana products.     38 Table of Contents   Convertible Loan and Management Agreements with Comprehensive Care Group LLC   On March 19, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries DEP and NMG, entered into a convertible loan agreement (the “ Convertible Loan Agreement ”) and a management agreement (the “ Management Agreement ”), respectively, with Comprehensive Care Group LLC (“ CCG ”), an Arkansas limited liability company, with respect to the development of a medical marijuana dispensary including a 50 flowering plant cultivation facility in West Memphis, Arkansas which agreements were effective as of March 15, 2019.   Pursuant to the Convertible Loan Agreement, DEP agreed to make loan advances to CCG from time to time in the aggregate principal amount of up to $1,250,000 and as of July 31, 2020, DEP has loaned $1,353,373 to CCG. The loan proceeds were used to fund the construction of the medical marijuana dispensary facility, and to provide working capital to cover initial operating expenses. The construction was completed and all permits and licenses were received for the dispensary in late April 2020, which opened for operations on April 27, 2020.   The interest on the outstanding principal amount is currently set at $6,000 per month, payable monthly in arrears on or before the first calendar day of each month. CCG is not obligated to repay any principal outstanding under the loan until March 30, 2021. Either CCG or DEP may unilaterally extend the maturity date by one year, and may thereafter continue to extend the maturity date on a yearly basis by increments of one year (each, an “ Extension Option ”) by providing written notice of the exercise of the Extension Option by the party seeking an extension to the other party; provided, however, that under no circumstances shall any extended maturity date extend beyond the expiration of the term of the Management Agreement entered into between NMG and CCG. The Company extended the loan maturity date by one year resulting in a new maturity date of March 30, 2023. The Management Agreement has an expiration of March 15, 2024 and can be mutually extendable.   Upon the latter of: (a) one year after granting of a medical marijuana dispensary license by the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission to CCG, or (b) one year after entering into the Convertible Loan Agreement, DEP may, in its sole discretion, subject to DEP providing all reasonable assistance to obtain all necessary approvals from the applicable government authorities to engage in the medical marijuana dispensary business, elect to convert all of the outstanding indebtedness into preferred units of CCG equal to 40% of the overall member units of CCG, subject to approval of the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission, with the following preferred rights: (i) the right to an allocative share of 66.67% of the net profits of CCG (as defined in the Convertible Loan Agreement) and the right to distributions equal to 66.67% of the net profits on a monthly basis; (ii) the right to a 66.67% share of CCG’s assets upon dissolution of CCG; and (iii) the right to 66.67% of all voting rights of members of CCG. DEP is waiting for regulatory clearance from the State regulators before proceeding with the conversion   Pursuant to the Management Agreement, NMG provides operations and management services to CCG (including management, staffing, operations administration, oversight and other related services) for the medical marijuana dispensary. In consideration for such services CCG pays NMG a monthly management fee in the amount equal to 66.67% of the Monthly Net Profits (as defined below) of CCG for the immediately-preceding month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that DEP exercises its conversion right under the Convertible Loan Agreement, then NMG’s monthly management fee shall be fixed at $6,000 per month, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. For purposes of the Management Agreement, “Monthly Net Profits” means, for each calendar month, an amount equal to CCG’s gross revenue for such calendar month less CCG’s operating expenses (including cost of goods sold, interest, and tax for said month), as reasonably determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Acquisition of NMG Ohio LLC   We, through NMG, currently own NMG Ohio, LLC (“ NMG Ohio ”), which had a cannabis dispensary carrying on business as “The Clubhouse” in Elyria, Loraine County, Ohio. On January 31, 2019, we, through NMG, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 70% interest in NMG Ohio. The consideration for the remaining 70% interest in NMG Ohio consists of cash payments totaling $1,575,000 and 3,173,864 common shares of the Company. As at the date hereof, we have issued 3,173,864 common shares, with a fair value of $1,188,168, and paid $1,575,000. All share and cash payments for the transactions have been paid in full and closing of the acquisition was subject to receipt of regulatory approval, which all approvals and final license and name transfer approvals from the Ohio Department of Pharmacy were received in early September 2020 but the remaining 70% was not closed as of July 31, 2021. As such, the dispensary license for The Clubhouse dispensary, as well as the assets and liabilities associated with the dispensary, were transferred to the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, NMG OH 1 LLC. On September 17, 2021, the final award of the production license was transferred to our wholly owned subsidiary, NMG OH P1 LLC, and the transaction closed resulting in NMG now owning 100% of NMG Ohio.     39 Table of Contents   Transaction and Settlement with Green Light District Holdings Inc. – ShowGrow Long Beach and San Diego   Prior Agreement with Green Light District Holdings Inc.   On November 28, 2018, we entered into an interim agreement (the “ Prior GLDH Agreement ”) with Green Light District Holdings Inc. (“ GLDH ”), a private company incorporated under the laws of Delaware, and David Barakett, whereby our Company agreed to acquire up to 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of GLDH. We concurrently made a strategic investment in a senior secured convertible note issued by GLDH in the principal amount of $5,200,000 (the “ Prior GLDH Note ”), bearing interest at the rate of 20% per annum and maturing on November 28, 2020.
At the time, GLDH was the owner of the ShowGrow dispensary brand, and owner of:
(a) the ShowGrow Long Beach dispensary,         (b) 43% of the equity interest and 60% of the voting rights in the ShowGrow San Diego dispensary, and         (c) 30% of the equity interest in the ShowGrow Las Vegas dispensary.
GLDH is also the owner of the ShowGrow app. The dispensaries were in various stages of licensing.
In order to fund our original investment in GLDH, Australis advanced a $4,000,000 loan which was evidenced by a senior secured note dated November 28, 2018, bearing an interest rate of 15% per annum and maturing in two years. The terms required semi-annual interest payments unless we elected to accrue the interest by adding it to the principal amount of the debt facility. We may prepay the loan at any time, in any amount, subject to a 5% prepayment penalty on any amount repaid within the first year of the loan. Additionally, Australis exercised $1.2 million in warrants they held in our Company at an exercise price of CAD$0.50, which equated to 3,206,160 common shares.
We paid a financing fee to Australis in the approximate amount of CAD$795,660, by issuing 1,105,083 Common Shares at a deemed price of CAD$0.72 per share.   Original Settlement and Release Agreement   On June 19, 2019, our Company, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary NMG LB, and our 60% owned subsidiary NMG SD, entered into a settlement agreement (the “ Original GLDH Settlement Agreement ”) with GLDH, The Airport Collective, Inc.

the Company issuing to Mr. Barakett or his designee up to 1,340,502 Common Shares at a deemed price of CAD$0.7439 per share, subject to NMG SD receiving all licenses, permits, and authorizations required for NMG SD to conduct medical commercial cannabis retail operations at the San Diego Location (the “ SD Medical Licenses ”) (issued);         B.
the Company issuing to Mr. Barakett or his designee up to 1,340,502 Common Shares at a deemed price of CAD$0.7439 per share, subject to NMG SD receiving all licenses, permits, and authorizations required for NMG SD to conduct adult-use commercial cannabis retail operations at the San Diego Location (the “ SD Adult-use Licenses ”) (issued); and         C. the Company paying certain legal and consulting expenses incurred by GLDH, Airport Collective and Barakett in an aggregate amount of US$90,500 (paid); and
ii. SGSD agreed to assign its lease for the San Diego Location to NMG SD, and to release our Company, NMG LB and NMG SD from any and all claims, in consideration of the payment by us of a total of USD$500,000 to SGSD’s members, to be paid and satisfied by the issuance of Common Shares to them at the maximum discount allowed by the CSE (issued).   NMG SD is owned 60% by our subsidiary, DEP, and 40% by SJJR, LLC (“ SJJR ”). Mr. Barakett agreed to cover SJJR’s portion of all start-up costs associated with NMG SD establishing commercial cannabis operations at the San Diego Location, inclusive of: (i) the costs associated with becoming a tenant at the San Diego Location; and (ii) all construction costs associated with building out the San Diego Location for NMG SD’s operations. The share consideration payable to Mr. Barakett under the Amended GLDH Settlement Agreement is subject to reduction if Mr. Barakett fails to meet this obligation on a timely basis.   NMG SD, which has assumed the lease on the ShowGrow San Diego premises, has been awarded its own medical commercial cannabis retail license and adult-use commercial retail license and commenced operations on April 15, 2020. In consideration for the landlord, Green Road, LLC, agreeing to consent to the assignment of the original lease with SGSD to NGM SD, we agreed to provide the following consideration to the landlord:     i.
$700,000 in Common Shares of the Company calculated upon execution of the assignment and first amendment to commercial lease (the “ Assignment and First Amendment ”), dated June 13, 2019, at the maximum discount allowed by the CSE to be issued to the landlord immediately following execution of the Assignment and First Amendment (1,031,725 shares issued on August 12, 2019);         ii. $783,765 in cash to be paid to the landlord via bank draft within five (5) business days of execution of the Assignment and First Amendment (paid); and         iii. $750,000 in cash, plus interest at the rate of five percent (5%) simple per annum accruing from the effective date to be paid no later than five (5) business days of the landlord’s receipt from the City of San Diego of a Conditional Use Permit allowing adult-use commercial cannabis storefront retail operations at the San Diego Location (paid).
Pursuant to the Assignment and First Amendment, the parties agreed to amend the original lease to permit NMG SD to have three (3) five (5) year renewal options as opposed to two (2) renewal options. In addition, the parties agreed to reduce the amount of the sale bonus provision in the original lease to $1,000,000 from $2,000,000, which shall only be payable in connection with the first two assignments triggering this obligation, and thereafter, assignments will not require payment of a sale bonus. Furthermore, the parties also amended certain provisions of the original lease to ensure that any change in members representing less than fifty percent (50%) of the existing membership interests of NMG SD shall be an excluded transaction and not trigger the sale bonus or be deemed an assignment requiring consent of the landlord.     41 Table of Contents   Amended and Restated Convertible Note and General Security Agreement   As contemplated by the Original GLDH Settlement Agreement, we entered into a loan agreement with GLDH dated June 19, 2019 (the “ 2019 GLDH Loan Agreement ”), pursuant to which the Prior GLDH Note has been superseded and replaced with an amended and restated senior secured convertible note payable to us by GLDH in the principal amount of $5,200,000 (the “ Amended and Restated GLDH Note ”). The Amended and Restated GLDH Note bears interest at the rate of 20% per annum, compounded annually, and was repayable on June 19, 2022 (see Asset Purchase Agreement below). GLDH’s obligations under 2019 GLDH Loan Agreement and the Amended and Restated GLDH Note have been guaranteed by Airport Collective, and are secured under a security agreement dated June 19, 2019 by all of GLDH’s and Airport Collective’s personal property, including but not limited to equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, cash or cash equivalents, and rights under contracts.   Asset Purchase Agreement   Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, NMG Long Beach has agreed to purchase all of GLDH’s and Airport Collective’s assets (the “ Purchased Assets ”) utilized in the retail cannabis business at the Long Beach Location for $6,700,000. Upon closing of the transaction, the outstanding principal amount under the Amended and Restated GLDH Note was applied to the purchase price, and Airport Collective will be released from its obligations as a guarantor of the GLDH’s obligations under the Amended and Restated GLDH Note.
We will pay the balance of the purchase price for the Purchased Assets by issuing up to 2,681,006 Common shares at a deemed price of CAD$0.7439 per share (issued in escrow on August 12, 2019); the number of shares required to pay and satisfy the balance of the purchase price for the Purchased Assets in the amount of $1,500,000 was determined with reference to the Agreed Foreign Exchange Rate of CAD$1.3296:USD$1.00. NMG LB received all approvals and license transfer from local and state authorities to conduct medical and adult-use commercial cannabis retail operation at the Long Beach Location, which were transferred to NMG LB at the end of August 2020 and is expected to close in the near future. The purchase price is fixed and the share consideration remains subject to reduction with reference to the liabilities of the business that will be outstanding on the closing date, which is expected to occur in the near future. Any final settlement that is different than currently estimated will be allocated to other income or expense.   Contemporaneous Loan   We entered into a contemporaneous loan (the “ Contemporaneous Loan ”) with GLDH in the amount of $726,720 to fund certain business improvements and expansion needs of GLDH’s business operations. We and NMG LB agreed to forgive the Contemporaneous Loan on the date of closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement.   Management Assignment and Assumption Agreement   On or around August 1, 2019, NMG LB began managing the ShowGrow Long Beach business pursuant to the management assignment and assumption agreement dated June 19, 2019, among NMG LB, GLDH and Airport Collective. Under the agreement, NMG LB is entitled to manage the business and recognize the profits from the business until NMG LB receives all approval and license transfer for operations at the Long Beach Location, which were received and transferred at the end of August 2020, and the Asset Purchase Agreement is expected to close in the near future.     42 Table of Contents   Acquisition of Canopy   Membership Interest Purchase Agreement #1   On November 30, 2021, DEP entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (the “ MIPA #1 ”) to purchase eighty percent (80%) of the issued and outstanding membership interests (the “ Purchased Interests ”) of Canopy from Cary Stiebel (the “ Continuing Owner ”), Jana Stiebel, Jayme Rivard, Adrian Dermicek, and Laurie Johnson (collectively, the “ Sellers ”).   As consideration for DEP’s purchase of the Purchased Interests, DEP will pay to Sellers a total purchase price of $4,800,000 comprised of: (i) $2,500,000 to be paid in cash (the “ Cash Purchase Price ”); and (ii) $2,300,000 of debt to be evidenced by a secured promissory note (the “ Promissory Note ”).   Pursuant to MIPA #1, DEP is obligated to transfer the Cash Purchase Price in escrow to Secured Trust Escrow, Inc. (the “ Escrow Agent ”) and, following such transfer, the Sellers are to assign the Purchased Interests to DEP on either the first or the sixteenth day of the first calendar month following DEP’s transfer of the Cash Purchase Price to the Escrow Agent. As a closing condition, DEP is also required to deliver the Promissory Note to the Sellers. MIPA #1 specifically states that the Cash Purchase Price is not to be released from escrow by the Escrow Agent to the Sellers until receipt by DEP of approval of the transaction from the local and state regulators, and the completion of any required audited annual financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements of Canopy prepared in accordance with US GAAP.   As described below, contemporaneous with the execution of MIPA #1, DEP also entered into a second membership interest purchase agreement to purchase, subject to all approvals required by applicable laws and regulations, the remaining twenty percent (20%) of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Canopy from the Continuing Owner (“ MIPA #2 ”). In MIPA #1, the parties have agreed that the target working capital for Canopy on the date that DEP is assigned the Purchased Interests shall be Zero Dollars ($0.00). The Sellers are obligated to deliver a statement of financial position for Canopy that provides, among other things, Canopy’s current working capital. DEP has up to one (1) year from the delivery of such statement to provide an adjusted statement based on DEP’s further financial due diligence. The Sellers will then have an opportunity to dispute and if no agreement is reached, a neutral third-party will determine the actual working capital of Canopy as of the date the Purchased Interests are assigned to DEP. The purchase price in MIPA #2 is subject to adjustments based on the actual working capital as determined by the calculations made pursuant to MIPA #1.   The foregoing description of MIPA #1 does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the MIPA #1, which is filed as Exhibit 10.63 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on January 17, 2023 and is incorporated by reference herein.   Secured Promissory Note   DEP issued the Promissory Note payable to the Sellers in the principal amount of $2,300,000 on November 30, 2021. The Promissory Note was delivered as partial consideration for DEP’s agreement to purchase the Purchased Interests (80% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Canopy) from the Sellers.   The Promissory Note does not become effective by its terms unless and until the state regulators and local regulators approve DEP as the owner of the Purchased Interests (the date such approval is received being the “ Effective Date ”). In the event the MIPA #1 for DEP to purchase the Purchased Interests is terminated for any reason, the Promissory Note will terminate automatically.   Pursuant to the Promissory Note, interest will accrue on the principal amount from the Effective Date at the rate of ten percent (10%) compounded annually. DEP will be obligated to make monthly interest-only payments for the initial six (6) months following the Effective Date. Following the initial six (6) months, no payments shall be due until the maturity date, which is the date that is five (5) years following the Effective Date.   Following the transfer of the Purchased Interests to DEP, Canopy will sign a joinder to the Promissory Note and further enter into a security agreement granting a security interest to the Sellers in all of Canopy’s assets to secure DEP’s fulfillment of its obligations under the Promissory Note.   The foregoing description of the Secured Promissory Note does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Secured Promissory Note, which is filed as Exhibit 10.64 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on January 17, 2023 and is incorporated by reference herein.     43 Table of Contents   Security Agreement   On November 30, 2021, Canopy entered into a security agreement, as grantor (in such capacity, the “ Grantor ”), granting a security interest in all of Grantor’s personal property, general intangibles, accounts receivable, real property, insurance proceeds, deposits and documents, investment property, instruments and letter of credit rights, proceeds and products, permits, licenses and entitlements. The secured interest granted pursuant to the security agreement is for the purposes of securing the payment obligations of DEP under the Promissory Note.   The foregoing description of the Security Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Security Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.65 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on January 17, 2023 and is incorporated by reference herein.   Escrow Agreement   On November 30, 2021, DEP, Canopy, the Sellers and the Escrow Agent entered into the Holding Escrow Instructions (the “ Escrow Agreement ”) in order to facilitate the sale of the Purchased Interests in Canopy by the Sellers to DEP. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Cash Purchase Price in the amount of $2,490,000 is to be deposited by DEP with the Escrow Agent, in escrow. The Escrow Agent shall disburse the funds as directed by the parties pursuant to written instructions. Escrow Agent shall receive specific instructions as to the release of funds, including but not limited to the amount of the funds to be released and detailed recipient information. Upon receipt of such request to release funds, the Escrow Agent shall prepare an amendment and/or authorization to release funds to be signed by the parties. The Escrow Agent shall only release funds when such amendment and/or authorization to release funds is executed by the parties.   The Escrow Agent shall receive, as compensation for services a fee in the amount of $6,000. Escrow fees shall be deducted out of the initial deposit into escrow and pre-paid by DEP. At closing, the escrow fees shall be split equally between DEP and the Sellers. In the event of cancellation of the escrow, DEP shall pay a $3,000 escrow fee and all other escrow funds shall be distributed as instructed to the Escrow Agent and under the terms of the Escrow Agreement.   The foregoing description of the Escrow Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Escrow Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.66 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on January 17, 2023 and is incorporated by reference herein.   Membership Interest Purchase Agreement #2   On November 30, 2021, DEP entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (“ MIPA #2 ”) to purchase the remaining 20% of the issued and outstanding membership interests (the “ Remaining Purchased Interests ”) of Canopy from the Continuing Owner.   As consideration for DEP’s purchase of the Remaining Purchased Interests, DEP will pay to the Continuing Owner a total purchase price of $1,000,000 (the “ Purchase Price ”) to be paid via either: (i) shares of the Company’s common stock (the “ Consideration Shares ”); or (ii) in cash at DEP’s sole option if such payment takes place within six months following the date of MIPA #1 pursuant to which DEP acquired 80% of the issued and outstanding membership interest of Canopy. In the event DEP elects or is required to pay the Purchase Price via Consideration Shares, the amount of Consideration Shares shall be determined based on the 10-day volume weighted average price (“ VWAP ”) on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “ CSE ”) as of the date of execution of MIPA #1. In the event that, six months following the execution date of MIPA #1, the value of the Consideration Shares have decreased such that total value of the Consideration Shares is less than 90% of its value, DEP agrees to cause the Company to issue an additional $100,000 worth of shares of the Company’s common stock (the “ Additional Shares ”) to the Continuing Owner based on the VWAP calculated as of six (6) months following the closing of MIPA #1.   The Purchase Price is to be adjusted based on the actual working capital of Canopy as of the closing of MIPA #1.     44 Table of Contents   Within seven business days from the date that DEP receives notification from the city and state regulators that it is approved as the sole owner of Canopy and all adjustment calculations for determining the working capital are completed, DEP shall be obligated to pay to Continuing Owner the Purchase Price subject to applicable adjustments.   The foregoing description of the MIPA #2 does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the MIPA #2, which is filed as Exhibit 10.68 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on January 17, 2023 and is incorporated by reference herein.   Amendment to MIPA #1 and MIPA #2   On June 17, 2022, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, DEP, entered into the first amendment to MIPA #1 and MIPA #2 (the “ First Amendment ”) whereby the cash purchase price under MIPA #1 was reduced from $2,500,000 to $1,250,000 and the Company agreed to issue the following shares of common stock of the Company, subject to compliance with the policies of the CSE:     (a)  The Company agreed to issue to the Sellers shares with an aggregate value of $1,250,000 based on the VWAP for the 10 consecutive trading days prior to the effective date of the First Amendment being June 17, 2022 (the “ Effective Date ”) (9,328,358 shares);         (b)  The Company agreed to issue additional shares to the Continuing Owner equal to the difference between the amount of the shares of common stock of the Company that were issued by the Company to the Continuing Owner on December 3, 2021 (the “ MIPA #2 Shares ”) and the amount of shares that the Continuing Owner would have received had the VWAP for the MIPA #2 Shares been calculated as of the Effective Date (the “ Additional PA #2 Shares ”) (4,734,530 shares);         (c)  On the date that is 18 months (548 days) following the Effective Date of the First Amendment (the “ Additional Share Issuance Date ”) the Company will issue $100,000 worth of shares to the Sellers based on the 10-day VWAP calculated as of the Additional Share Issuance Date; and         (d)  The Company agreed to issue to the Continuing Owner $300,000 worth of shares (the “ Additional True-up Shares ”) within three days following the Effective Date of the First Amendment, which shall be priced at the 10-day VWAP calculated as of the Effective Date of the First Amendment (2,238,806 shares).
Prior to the conclusion of the calculation of the actual working capital in accordance with MIPA #1 and MIPA #2, the Sellers must complete, execute and deliver to DEP Schedule D to the First Amendment, which shall set forth the amount of Additional True-up Shares each Seller is entitled to (as applicable) and such Additional True-up Shares shall be retitled in accordance with Schedule D to the First Amendment. In the event Schedule D to the First Amendment is not completed, executed and delivered to DEP prior to the conclusion of the calculation of the actual working capital, DEP shall have no obligation to retitle the shares and all Sellers will waive any claims against DEP and the Company in connection with such issuance made in accordance with Section 2(b)(v) of the First Amendment.   Upon conclusion of the calculation of the actual working capital in accordance with MIPA #1 and MIPA #2, the parties have further agreed as follows:     (a) If the actual working capital is less than the target working capital of $nil, the Purchase Price (as defined in PA #2) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the target working capital and the actual working capital and all of the Additional True-up Shares shall be forfeited and retuned to Company for cancellation;         (b)
If the actual working capital is greater than the target working capital of $nil and the Additional True-up Shares are sufficient to cover the difference between the actual working capital and the target working capital (the “ DEP Deficit ”), the parties agree that all or a portion of the Additional True-up Shares (valued at the 10-day VWAP calculated as of the Effective Date of the First Amendment and subject to compliance with the policies of the CSE) shall be issued to Sellers to satisfy the DEP Deficit owed by DEP to the Sellers in accordance with Section 2.02(b) of PA #2;         (c) If the actual working capital is greater than the target working capital and the Additional True-up Shares are insufficient to cover the DEP Deficit, all of the Additional True-up Shares shall be issued to the Sellers and the parties agree that any additional amounts owed to the Sellers shall be paid by DEP to the Sellers via additional shares of common stock of the Company.     45 Table of Contents   In addition to the terms of the First Amendment, the parties have agreed that the release of any Additional True-up Shares shall be subject to the Sellers providing written direction to DEP for the release of the Additional True-up Shares payable under the First Amendment.   On December 7, 2022, pursuant to the previously announced (i) membership interest purchase agreement (“MIPA #1”), dated November 30, 2021, as amended on June 17, 2022, entered into between the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, DEP Nevada, Inc.

DEP’s purchase of the Purchased Interests qualifies as a change of control transaction for such purposes.   On November 30, 2021, the Landlord, the Tenant and the Company entered into a Landlord Consent to Change of Control of Tenant (the “ Landlord Consent ”), whereby the Landlord has consented to the purchase by DEP of the Purchased Interests in two transactions contemplated by MIPA #1 and MIPA #2, subject to certain conditions as outlined below.   The Landlord Consent is subject to the following conditions: (1) Tenant must pay the Landlord a transfer fee equal to $290,000; (2) Tenant must pay the Landlord $229.60 in liquidated damages; (3) Tenant must reimburse Landlord for legal fees associated with the change of control transaction, subject to a cap of $6,500; and (4) a renewal of the current guaranty of the lease is delivered to the Landlord. The Consent became effective following the assignment of the Purchased Interests to DEP.   The foregoing description of the Landlord Consent does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Landlord Consent, which is filed as Exhibit 10.67 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on January 17, 2023 and is incorporated by reference herein.      46 Table of Contents   The Lease   The Lease provides for a five-year term that includes three five-year extension periods (each, an “ Option Term ”) (collectively, the “ Lease Term ”). The monthly rent under the Lease for the first four months is $0.00 per month; for months five through 12, the monthly rent is $6,190.00 per month; and for months 13 through 24, the monthly rent is $7,200.00 per month.   The monthly rent is subject to an annual increase of three percent per year, but in no event less than the amount of the increase in the Consumer Price Index, as of the first day of July every year during the term of the lease (the “ Adjustment Date ”), in each fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) of the Lease Term, which Lease Term shall include the Option Term and any extensions of Lease that may hereinafter be granted, beginning in the year as follows: July 1, 2020 and on the first of July in each fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) of any extensions of Lease Term thereafter, the monthly rental shall be increased at least three percent, but in no case less than the amount calculated by multiplying the amount of the then monthly rental, and as thereafter adjusted from time to time in accordance with the provisions of Article 5.2 of the Lease, by a fraction of which the denominator is the cost of living for the calendar month February, 17 months previous to the Adjustment Date, as reflected in the Consumer Price Index, or, at Landlord’s option, the same Index for the United States as a whole (as determined by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or any successor Index), and the numerator is the cost of living as reflected in the same Index for the calendar month of February, five months previous to each such Adjustment Date. The annual rent in any fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) will not be less than 103% of the annual rent for the then immediately preceding fiscal year.   The monthly rent for the first year of each Option Term shall be the fair market value monthly rent for the premises as determined by the Landlord as of the effective date of the Tenant’s exercise of an Option Term. In the event there is a dispute between the Landlord and the Tenant regarding the monthly rent for the first year of an Option Term as of the date of Tenant’s exercise of an Option Term, and the Landlord and Tenant cannot mutually agree on a monthly rent for an Option Term 90 days before the expiration of the Lease, third-party appraisers will set the Option Term monthly rent.   In addition to monthly rent, the Tenant is required to pay certain maintenance fees based on Tenant’s gross sales for each year during the term of the Lease. These fees are modified and replaced in the Second Amendment.   The Second Amendment to Lease   On November 30, 2021, the Landlord and the Tenant entered into a Second Amendment to Lease Agreement (the “ Second Amendment ”).  The Second Amendment modifies the monthly rent fees payable under the Lease, such that the monthly rent fee for December 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 will be $9,000.00 per month. On July 1, 2022, the monthly rent will be subject to the normal annual increases set forth in the Lease.   The maintenance fees in the Lease are superseded and replaced with the a new monthly maintenance fee equal to One and One Half Percent (1.5%) of the Tenant’s gross sales, which shall be computed each calendar month and, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the calendar month immediately following the close of such period, the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord the maintenance fee for the immediately preceding calendar month.   The Second Amendment includes a waiver and release of all claims against the Landlord up to and including the date of the Second Amendment.   Agreement and Plan of Merger – New Jersey   On December 21, 2022, the Company, its wholly owned subsidiary, DEP Nevada, Inc. (“DEP”), BaM Body and Mind Dispensary NJ Inc., a New Jersey corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of DEP (the “Merger Sub”), CraftedPlants NJ Corp., a New Jersey corporation (the “Surviving Entity”) and those certain shareholders of the Surviving Entity (the “Sellers”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) whereby Merger Sub merged with and into the Surviving Entity, and following the consummation of the merger, which occurred on December 21, 2022, the Surviving Entity became a wholly owned subsidiary of DEP and changed its name to BaM Body and Mind Dispensary NJ, Inc.     47 Table of Contents   Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on the closing DEP delivered a cash payment of US$50,000 to the Sellers, with a delayed payment of approximately US$120,000 to be paid to the Sellers upon funding of the project buildout.   Further, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on December 21, 2022, the Company issued to the Sellers an aggregate of 16,666,667 shares of its common stock (the “Merger Consideration Shares”) at a deemed price of CAD$0.08 per share.  The Merger Consideration Shares will be held in escrow and will not be released to the Sellers until the Surviving Entity achieves certain milestones, however, the Sellers will still maintain the voting and participation rights with respect to the Merger Consideration Shares while being held in escrow.  The post-closing milestones are as follows:     1. If, within two (2) years of the closing date, the Surviving Entity’s application is approved and is granted pending license approval from the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission (the “CRC”), 70% of the Merger Consideration Shares will be release from escrow.         2. If, within three (3) years of the closing date, the Surviving Entity opens for business as a recreational cannabis dispensary, 30% of the Merger Consideration Shares will be released from escrow.
If either or both of the milestones are not achieved within the time periods after the closing date (the “Milestone Dates”), the Company shall have the option to cancel the Merger Consideration Shares attributable to the failed milestone by delivering written notice to Sellers and in the event of such cancellation, the portion of the Merger Consideration Shares attributable to the failed milestone shall be surrendered and cancelled without any further action required by the parties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either or both of the milestones are not achieved (or if it becomes obvious that they will not be achieved) by their respective Milestone Dates because of delays that are not caused by the Sellers, the Sellers may, before the applicable Milestone Dates, provide notice to the Company, and the applicable Milestone Date will be extended to such date as is reasonably necessary for the milestone to be achieved.  The parties will work together in mutual good faith to determine the dates by when the milestones can be reasonably achieved.   The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.3 in the Company’s fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K filed on January 17, 2023.   Nevada Production Facility   On June 20, 2019, we announced the receipt of a conditional use permit from Clark County, Nevada, for a new production facility located within one mile of NMG’s existing cultivation facility located at 3375 Pepper Lane, in Las Vegas. The facility is approximately 7,500 square feet, and tenant improvement of the building holding the facility was completed in February 2020. The facility includes high-volume extraction equipment, which we expect will dramatically increase our manufacturing capacity and efficiency for our extraction products, including oils, wax, live resin and ambrosia. The facility also expands the kitchen area and creates an opportunity for the Company to white label for brands seeking an entry to the Nevada market. After passing all inspections, receiving all permits, and finalizing license transfer approvals, the new production facility began operations in March 2020.   Material Contracts   Other than already disclosed above under the subsection titled “Description of Our Business”, we have the following material contracts:     48 Table of Contents   Loan Agreement   On July 19, 2021, we (also referred to as the “ Borrower ”), along with our subsidiaries, DEP Nevada Inc., Nevada Medical Group, LLC, NMG OH 1, LLC, NMG OH P1, LLC, NMG Long Beach, LLC, NMG Cathedral City, LLC, NGM CA 1, LLC, NMG CA C1, LLC, NMG MI 1, Inc., NMG MI P1, Inc., and NMG MI C1, Inc.

COVID-19 has since spread rapidly throughout many countries, and, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. In an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many countries, including the United States, Canada and China, have imposed unprecedented restrictions on travel, and there have been business closures and a substantial reduction in economic activity in countries that have had significant outbreaks of COVID-19. Although certain restrictions have been relaxed, COVID-19 may have a future material impact on our results of operation with respect to retail sales at our dispensary locations as well as wholesales of our products in Nevada to dispensaries in Nevada. Significant uncertainty remains as to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, and on the global economy as a whole. It is currently not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to prior levels. We do not yet know the full extent of any impact on our business or our operations, however, we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely, and intend to follow health and safety guidelines as they evolve.   Off-balance sheet arrangements   There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.   Critical Accounting Policies   Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.   We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.   We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.   · Income taxes   The determination of deferred income tax assets or liabilities requires subjective assumptions regarding future income tax rates and the likelihood of utilizing tax carry-forwards. Changes in these assumptions could materially affect the recorded amounts, and therefore do not necessarily provide certainty as to their recorded values.     58 Table of Contents     · Foreign currency   The Company determines the functional currency through an analysis of several indicators such as expenses and cash flows, financing activities, retention of operating cash flows, and frequency of transactions with the reporting entity.     · Fair value of financial instruments   Management uses valuation techniques, in measuring the fair value of financial instruments, where active market quotes are not available.
In applying the valuation techniques, management makes maximum use of market inputs wherever possible, and uses estimates and assumptions that are, as far as possible, consistent with observable data that market participants would use in pricing the instrument. Where applicable data is not observable, management uses its best estimate about the assumptions that market participants would make. Such estimates include liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility may vary from the actual results that would be achieved in an arm’s length transaction at the reporting date.
The assessment of the timing and extent of impairment of intangible assets involves both significant judgements by management about the current and future prospects for the intangible assets as well as estimates about the factors used to quantify the extent of any impairment that is recognized.
· Long-lived assets and goodwill   Long-lived assets and goodwill are reviewed for indicators of impairment at least annually.  When there are indications of impairment, the Company calculates the fair value of reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of the asset groups for long-lived assets using various valuation techniques, which require the input of highly subjective assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimate.     · Intellectual property   The recoverability of the carrying value of the intellectual property is dependent on numerous factors. The carrying value of these assets is reviewed by management when events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recovered. If impairment is determined to exist, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.     · Stock-based compensation   The option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly the expected stock price volatility. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and therefore the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company’s stock options.     · Business Combination   The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.    We perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination in order to record the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our best estimate of fair value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. Significant estimation is required in determining the fair value of the customer relationship intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities. The significant estimation is primarily due to the judgmental nature of the inputs to the valuation models used to measure the fair value of these intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities, as well as the sensitivity of the respective fair values to the underlying significant assumptions. We use the income approach to measure the fair value of these intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets included forecasted revenues from existing customers and existing customer attrition rates. When estimating the significant assumptions to be used in the valuation we include a consideration of current industry information, market and economic trends, historical results of the acquired business and other relevant factors. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. We engage the assistance of valuation specialists in concluding on fair value measurements in connection with determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.      59 Table of Contents   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company does not anticipate this amendment to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.   Management of financial risks   The financial risk arising from the Company’s operations are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.   These risks arise from the normal course of operations and all transactions undertaken are to support the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The risks associated with these financial instruments and the policies on how to mitigate these risks are set out below. Management manages and monitors these exposures to ensure appropriate measures are implemented on a timely and effective manner.     · Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Company reduces its exposure to credit risk by maintaining its cash with major financial institutions. Credit risk associated with the convertible loans receivable arises from the possibility that the principal and/or interest due may become uncollectible. The Company mitigates this risk by managing and monitoring the underlying business relationship. The Company is not currently exposed to any significant credit risk associated with its trade receivable.      · Liquidity risk   Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company had working capital deficit of $368,804 as at January 31, 2023. The Company outlined substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern in prior periods which has been alleviated by securing long term debt and increased sales. The Company anticipates that current cash on hand and working capital will ensure coverage for all expenses associated with current operations for one year from the issuance of these financial statements. Management believes that the Company has access to capital resources through potential public or private issuances of debt or equity securities to further contribute to the growth of the company.     · Interest rate risk   Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company is not exposed to interest rate risk as it does not hold financial instruments that will fluctuate in value due to changes in market interest rates.     · Currency risk   Currency risk is the risk that the fair values of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because they are denominated in currencies that differ from the respective functional currency. The Company is exposed to currency risk by incurring expenditures and holding assets denominated in currencies other than its functional currency. Assuming all other variables remain constant, a 1% change in the Canadian dollar against the US dollar would not result in a significant change to the Company’s operations.     · Other risks   The Company is not exposed to other risks unless otherwise noted.     60 Table of Contents   ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.   ITEM 4 – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to us is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and the Board.   Based on their evaluation as of January 31, 2023, our principal executive and principal financial and accounting officers have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of January 31, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.   In our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as at January 31, 2023, based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, material weaknesses were identified regarding experienced personnel with knowledge of GAAP and the proper levels of supervision and review required to provide timely financial information. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements could not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.   The Company added more experienced personnel in the accounting department to remediate this material weaknesses. However, the Company’s management will not consider this remediated until the control procedures operate for a period of time and the control procedures are tested to ensure they are operating effectively.   It should be noted that any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions designed to obtain reasonable (and not absolute) assurance as to its effectiveness, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals.   Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     61 Table of Contents   PART II – OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   We are not, and were not during our most recently completed fiscal quarter, engaged in any legal proceedings and none of our property is or was during that period the subject of any legal proceedings.
