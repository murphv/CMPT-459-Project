NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS
VOIP-PAL.com,
Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 1997 as All American Casting International, Inc.
The Company’s registered office is located at 7215 Bosque Blvd, Suite 102, Waco, Texas in the United States of America.
Since
March 2004, the Company has developed technology and patents related to Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) processes. All business activities
prior to March 2004 have been abandoned and written off to deficit. The Company operates in one reportable segment being the acquisition
and development of VoIP-related intellectual property including patents and technology. All intangible assets are located in the United
States of America.
In
December 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of Digifonica (International) Limited, a private company controlled by the CEO of
the Company, whose assets included several patents and technology developed for the VoIP market.
These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and
discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is in various stages of product development and continues to incur
losses and, as at December 31, 2022, had an accumulated deficit of $ 70,692,162
(September 30, 2022 - $ 70,076,579 ). The ability of the
Company to continue operations as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional working capital, settling outstanding debts and
generating profitable operations. These material uncertainties raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern. Should the going concern assumption not continue to be appropriate, further adjustments to carrying values of assets
and liabilities may be required. There can be no assurance that capital will be available as necessary to meet these continued developments
and operating costs or, if the capital is available, that it will be on terms acceptable to the Company. The issuances of additional
stock by the Company may result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of its current shareholders. Obtaining commercial loans,
assuming those loans would be available, will increase the Company’s liabilities and future cash commitments. If the Company is
unable to obtain financing in the amounts and on terms deemed acceptable, its business and future success may be adversely affected.
Additionally,
as the Company’s stated objective is to monetize its patent suite through the licensing or sale of its intellectual property (“IP”),
the Company being forced to litigate or to defend its IP claims through litigation casts substantial doubt on its future to continue
as a going concern. IP litigation is generally a costly process, and in the absence of revenue the Company must raise capital to continue
its own defense and to validate its claims – in the event of a failure to defend its patent claims, either because of lack of funding,
a court ruling against the Company or because of a protracted litigation process, there can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to raise additional capital to pay for an appeals process or a lengthy trial. The outcome of any litigation process may have a significant
adverse effect on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
COVID-19
In
March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic related to the COVID-19 coronavirus. Its impact on global economies
has been far-reaching and businesses around the world are being forced to cease or limit operations for long or indefinite periods of
time. Measures taken to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, including travel bans, quarantines, social distancing, and closures
of non-essential services have triggered significant disruptions to businesses worldwide, resulting in an economic slowdown. Global stock
markets have also experienced great volatility and significant declines. Governments and central banks have responded with monetary and
fiscal interventions to stabilize economic conditions.
The
duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of government and central bank responses, remains unclear
at this time. It is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, nor its impact on the financial
position and results of the Company in future periods. The Company is proceeding with its business activities as long as the work environment
remains safe – at this point there has been minimal disruption to day-to-day operations resulting from health and safety measures.
Disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets may increase the Company’s cost of capital and adversely impact access
to capital.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America (“US GAAP”).

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles
of Consolidation
These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiary, Digifonica. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. As at December 31, 2022, Digifonica had no activities.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of these consolidated financial statements required management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Where estimates have been used, financial results as determined by
actual events could differ from those estimates. Some of the more significant accounting estimates used in the preparation of the company’s
financial statements include deferred income taxes, the valuation of equity-related instruments issued, and the useful life and impairment
of intangible assets.
Cash
Cash
consists of cash on hand, cash held in trust, and monies held in checking and savings accounts. The Company had $ 19,499
in cash on December
31, 2022 (September 30, 2022 - $ 305,485 ).
Fixed
Assets
Fixed
assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over their useful lives; Furniture
and computers –
5 years .
Intangible
Assets
Intangible
assets, consisting of VoIP communication patent intellectual properties (IP) are recorded at cost and amortized over the assets estimated
life on a straight-line basis. Management considers factors such as remaining life of the patents, technological usefulness and other
factors in estimating the life of the assets.
The
carrying value of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment by management of the Company at least annually or upon the occurrence
of an event which may indicate that the carrying amount may be less than its fair value. If impaired, the Company will write- down such
impairment. In addition, the useful life of the intangible assets will be evaluated by management at least annually or upon the occurrence
of an event which may indicate that the useful life may have changed.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
FASB
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market
for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.
The
Company classifies financial assets and liabilities as held-for-trading, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, loans and receivables
or other financial liabilities depending on their nature. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized at fair value on
their initial recognition, except for those arising from certain related party transactions which are accounted for at the transferor’s
carrying amount or exchange amount.
Financial
assets and liabilities classified as held-for-trading are measured at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in net income. Financial
assets classified as held-to-maturity, loans and receivables, and financial liabilities other than those classified as held-for-trading
are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method of amortization. Financial assets classified as available-for-sale
are measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses being recognized as other comprehensive income until realized, or if an
unrealized loss is considered other than temporary, the unrealized loss is recorded in income.

NOTE
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
U.S.
GAAP establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair
value measurements. Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., an
exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs. The standard describes the following fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two
are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value:
− Level
1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
− Level
2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active;
or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
− Level
3: Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that are significant
to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The
fair value of cash is classified as Level 1 at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
The
Company classifies its financial instruments as follows: Cash is classified as held for trading and is measured at fair value. Accounts
payable and accrued liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities, and have a fair value approximating their carrying value,
due to their short-term nature.
Income
Taxes
Deferred
income taxes have been provided for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax reporting under the asset and liability
method, using expected tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation
allowance is provided when realization is not considered more likely than not.
The
Company’s policy is to classify income tax assessments, if any, for interest expense and for penalties in general and administrative
expenses. The Company’s income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS and corresponding states, generally for three
years after they are filed.
Loss
per Common Share
Basic
loss per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted income per share
includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and warrants outstanding during each period. To calculate diluted
loss per share, the Company uses the treasury stock method and the if-converted method.
For
the period ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended September 30, 2022, there were no potentially dilutive securities included in the
calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding.
Derivatives
We
account for derivatives pursuant to ASC 815,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . All derivative instruments
are recognized in the consolidated financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them.
We determine fair value of warrants and other option-type instruments based on option pricing models. The changes in fair value of these
instruments are recorded in income or expense.
Preferred
Shares
The
preferred shares carry super-voting rights with each shared issued having the equivalent of 1,550 votes . Preferred shares issued by the
Company are not convertible into or exchangeable for common shares and they are not exchangeable for equity nor redeemable for cash.
The preferred shares do not pay dividends. The preferred shares cannot be sold, exchanged or transferred to another party.
Stock-based
Compensation
The
Company recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based payments made to employees, directors and others based on the estimated fair
values of its common stock on the date of issuance.
The
Company determines the fair value of the share-based compensation payments granted as either the fair value of the consideration received
or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. If the fair value of the equity instruments
issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either the date at which
a commitment for performance to earn the equity instrument is reached or the date the performance is complete.
The
Company recognizes compensation expense for stock awards with service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period, which is included in operations. Stock option expense is recognized over the option’s vesting period.

PURCHASE OF DIGIFONICA
The
Company acquired Digifonica in December 2013. Pursuant to the terms in the Share Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”), the Company
acquired
100 % of Digifonica from the seller, the CEO of the Company (the “Seller”), for a cash payment of $ 800,000
and
389,023,561
common shares of the Company. The assets acquired through the acquisition were VoIP-related patented technology, including patents for
Lawful Intercept, routing, billing and rating, mobile gateway, advanced interoperability solutions, intercepting voice over IP communications,
and uninterrupted transmission of internet protocol transmissions during endpoint changes.
The
SPA included an anti-dilution clause (the “Anti-Dilution Clause”) that required the Company to maintain the Seller’s
percentage ownership of the Company at
40 % by issuing the Seller a proportionate number of common shares of any future issuance of the
Company’s common shares. Shares issued pursuant to the Anti-Dilution Clause were recorded as a share issuance cost within the Additional
Paid-in Capital account.
During
the year ended September 30, 2021, on April 12, 2021, the SPA was amended to provide that: a) from its inception until March 31, 2021,
the Company would issue warrants to purchase common shares of the Company in an equivalent amount to and instead of the required shares
being issued pursuant to the Anti-Dilution Clause; and b) the Anti-Dilution Clause would be null and from April 1, 2021 forward. As a
result of this amendment, the Seller returned
513,535,229
common shares to the treasury of the Company and relinquished his right to
receive an additional
107,935,333
common shares in exchange for
621,470,562
warrants to purchase common shares at a price of $ 0.021
for
a period of
ten years
from the date of issue.
NOTE

RETAINER
The
Company has retainers with certain of its professional service providers. The balance due on these prepaid retainers was $ 1,203
as of
December 31, 2022, and $ 1,181
as of September 30, 2022. The Company recognizes the expense from these retainers as they are invoiced
and the invoiced charges are deducted from the various providers’ prepaid retainer balances.

CORPORATE
HISTORY, OVERVIEW AND PRINCIPAL BUSINESS
VoIP-PAL.com
Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 1997 as All American Casting International, Inc.
and changed its name to VOIP MDI.com in 2004 and subsequently to Voip-Pal.Com Inc. in 2006. Since March 2004, the Company has been in
the development stage of becoming a Voice-over-Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) re-seller, a provider of a proprietary transactional
billing platform tailored to the points and air mile business, and a provider of anti-virus applications for smartphones. All business
activities prior to March 2004 have been abandoned and written off to deficit.
In
2013, the Company acquired Digifonica International (DIL) Limited (“Digifonica”), to fund and co-develop Digifonica’s
patent suite. Digifonica had been founded in 2003 with the vision that the internet would be the future of all forms of telecommunications
- a team of twenty top engineers with expertise in Linux and Internet telephony developed and wrote a software suite with applications
that provided solutions for several core areas of internet connectivity. In order to properly test the applications, Digifonica built
and operated three production nodes in Vancouver, Canada (Peer 1), London, UK (Teliasonera), and Denmark. Upon successfully developing
the technology, Digifonica filed for patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”).
The
Digifonica patents formed the basis for the Company’s current intellectual property, now a worldwide portfolio of twenty-six issued
and pending patents primarily designed for the broadband VoIP market.
The
Company’s intellectual property value is derived from its issued and pending patents. The inventions described in these patents,
among other things, provide the means to integrate VoIP services with legacy telecommunications systems such as the public switched telephone
network (PSTN) to create a seamless service using either legacy telephone numbers or IP addresses, and enhance the performance and value
of VoIP implementations worldwide.
VoIP
has been and continues to be a green field for innovation that has spawned numerous inventions, greatly benefitting consumers large and
small across the globe. VoIP is used in many places and by every modern telephony system vendor, network supplier, and retail and wholesale
carrier.
18
Results
of Operations
The
Company’s operating costs consist of expenses incurred to monetizing, selling and licensing its VoIP patents. Other operating costs
include expenses for legal, accounting and other professional fees, financing costs, and other general and administrative expenses.

GENERAL
AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
General
and administrative expenses for the three months ending December 31, 2022 totaled $506,337 compared to $266,426 during the same period
in 2021. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $239,911 or 90% more than the previous period was primarily due to an
increase in legal and professional fees and services.
AMORTIZATION
AND DEPRECIATION
Amortization
of the intellectual VoIP communications patent properties and depreciation of fixed assets for the three months ending December 31, 2022
totaled $35,115 compared to $35,114 during the same period in 2021. There was no material difference between depreciation and amortization
expense for the three months ending December 31, 2022 as compared to 2021.
The
Company follows GAAP (FAS 142) and is amortizing its intangibles over the remaining patent life of twelve (12) years. The Company evaluates
its intangible assets annually and determines if the fair market value is less than its historical cost. If the fair market value is
less, then impairment expense is recorded on the Company’s financial statements. The intangible assets on the financial statements
of the Company relate primarily to the Company’s acquisition of Digifonica (International) Limited.
STOCK
BASED COMPENSATION
Stock
based compensation for the three months ending December 31, 2022 totaled $76,231 compared to $Nil during the same period in 2021. The
increase in stock-based compensation expense of $76,231 or 100% more than the previous period was due to stock options vesting during
the period.
OTHER
ITEMS
Other
items for the period ending December 31, 2022 totaled $2,100 compared to $Nil during the same period in 2021. The decrease in other items
of $2,100 or 100% less than the previous period was due to forgiveness of director compensation.
INTEREST
EXPENSE
The
Company had no financing or interest costs for the three months ending December 31, 2022 and 2021.
NET
GAIN (LOSS)
The
Company reported a net loss of $615,583 for the three months ending December 31, 2022 compared to a net loss of $301,540 for the same
period in 2021. The increase of $314,043 or 104% as compared to 2021 was primarily due to stock-based compensation and an increase in
legal fees and professional fees.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $70,692,162 as compared to an accumulated deficit of $66,685,703 at December
31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a working capital deficit of $267,184 as compared to a working capital deficit of
$118,104 at December 31, 2021. The decrease in the Company’s working capital of $149,080 is due to ongoing operating expenses and
less equity raised during the period.
Net
cash used by operations for the three months ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $374,986 and $269,328 respectively. The increase in
net cash used for operations for the three months ending December 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ending December 31, 2021 was
primarily due to stock-based compensation and an increase in legal fees and professional services.
Net
cash used in investing activities for the three months ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $Nil and $Nil, respectively. Net cash provided
from financing activities for the three months ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $89,000 and $139,000, respectively. The decrease
in net cash provided by financing activities of $50,000 was due to lower amounts of equity raised and less cash proceeds from private
placements and no exercise of warrants during the three months ending December 31, 2022.
Liquidity
The
Company primarily finances its operations from cash received through the private placements of its common stock and the exercise of warrants
from investors and through the payment of stock-based compensation. While there can be no assurance that capital will be available as
necessary to meet continued developments and operating costs or, if the capital is available, that it will be on terms acceptable to
the Company, the Company believes its resources are adequate to fund its operations for the next 12 months.

Impact
of Inflation
We
believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the three months ending December 31, 2022. We cannot
assure you that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
Impact
of COVID-19
In
March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic related to the COVID-19 coronavirus. Its impact on global economies
has been far-reaching and businesses around the world are being forced to cease or limit operations for long or indefinite periods of
time. Measures taken to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, including travel bans, quarantines, social distancing, and closures
of non-essential services have triggered significant disruptions to businesses worldwide, resulting in an economic slowdown. Global stock
markets have also experienced great volatility and significant declines. Governments and central banks have responded with monetary and
fiscal interventions to stabilize economic conditions.
The
duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of government and central bank responses, remains unclear
at this time. It is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, nor its impact on the financial
position and results of the Company in future periods. The Company is proceeding with its business activities as long as the work environment
remains safe – at this point there has been minimal disruption to day-to-day operations resulting from health and safety measures.
Disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets may increase the Company’s cost of capital and adversely impact access
to capital.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.
In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a company’s
internal control system, including (i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and
communication, and (v) monitoring. In management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c), our management concluded as of the end of the
fiscal period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that our internal control over financial reporting has not been effective.
The company intends, as its finances improve, to hire additional accounting staff and implement additional controls.
As
defined by Auditing Standard No. 5, “An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that is Integrated with an Audit of
Financial Statements and Related Independence Rule and Conforming Amendments,” established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (“PCAOB”), a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies that results more than a remote likelihood
that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with the assessment
described above, management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses as of December 31, 2022:
1) Lack
of segregation of duties. At this time, our resources and size prevent us from being able
to employ sufficient resources to enable us to have adequate segregation of duties within
our internal control system. Management will periodically reevaluate this situation.
2) Lack
of a completely independent audit committee. Although it is majority independent, the audit
committee is not comprised solely of independent directors. We may establish an audit committee
comprised solely of independent directors when we have sufficient capital resources and working
capital to attract qualified independent directors and to maintain such a committee.
3) Insufficient
number of independent directors. At present, our Board of Directors does not consist of a
majority of independent directors, a factor that is counter to corporate governance practices
as set forth by the rules of various stock exchanges.
4) Insufficient
period-end balance sheet reconciliations and review of journal entries. Due to our size,
we have insufficient accounting staff resources to review accounting entries on a timely
basis. Management will periodically reevaluate this situation.
Our
management determined that these deficiencies constituted material weaknesses. Due to a lack of financial resources, we are not able
to, and do not intend to, immediately take any action to remediate these material weaknesses. We will not be able to do so until we acquire
sufficient financing to do so. We will implement further controls as circumstances, cash flow, and working capital permit. Notwithstanding
the assessment that our ICFR was not effective and that there were material weaknesses as identified in this report, we believe that
our financial statements fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the years covered thereby in
all material respects.
Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls
Our
management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily
prevent all fraud and material error. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving
our objectives and our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable
assurance level. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because
of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management override of the internal control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect such controls.

1. Locksmith
Financial Corporation, Inc. et al. (Plaintiff(s)) v VoIP-Pal.com Inc. et al (Defendant(s))
(Case No A-20-807745-C) filed in Clark County District Court, Nevada.
On
January 1, 2020, the Plaintiff filed suit in Nevada District Court claiming that they were owed 95,832,000 Voip-Pal common shares from
a previous case involving the Plaintiff and the Defendant that had been through a jury trial in 2019, in which the jury had made an award
to the Plaintiff that was monetary only, and did not include said shares - following the jury’s decision in the 2019 trial, the
Plaintiff accepted the award and waived their right to appeal. Voip-Pal vigorously disputed the Plaintiff’s 2020 claims on the
basis of claim preclusion (the 2020 claims were addressed in the previous action in 2019 and are now precluded); that Plaintiffs’
claims are untimely, and that the Plaintiffs no longer have standing to bring their claims.
During
the year ended September 30, 2022, the Court entered a judgment in favor of VoIP-Pal.com Inc and co-defendants, dismissing the 2020 case.
The Plaintiffs filed an appeal with the Nevada Supreme Court.
Subsequent
to the interim period ended December 31, 2022, following a hearing of the appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled to reverse the lower
court’s judgment in favor of Voip-Pal and has ordered that the case be remanded back to the lower court for further proceedings.
The Defendants (Voip-Pal et al) have filed a motion to the Supreme Court for reconsideration. The case is pending.
