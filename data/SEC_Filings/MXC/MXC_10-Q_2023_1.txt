Mexco
Energy Corporation and Subsidiaries
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1.
Nature of Operations
Mexco
Energy Corporation (a Colorado corporation) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Forman Energy Corporation (a New York corporation), Southwest
Texas Disposal Corporation (a Texas corporation) and TBO Oil & Gas, LLC (a Texas limited liability company) (collectively, the “Company”)
are engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”).
Most of the Company’s oil and gas interests are centered in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico; however, the Company owns producing
properties and undeveloped acreage in fourteen states. All of the Company’s oil and gas interests are operated by others.
2.
Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
Principles
of Consolidation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mexco Energy Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions associated with the consolidated operations have been eliminated.
Estimates
and Assumptions . In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (“GAAP”), management is required to make informed judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. In addition, significant estimates are used in determining proved oil and gas reserves. Although management
believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those estimates. The estimate of the
Company’s oil and natural gas reserves, which is used to compute depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of oil and
gas properties, is the most significant of the estimates and assumptions that affect these reported results.
Interim
Financial Statements .
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments
(consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022,
and the results of its operations and cash flows for the interim periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The consolidated financial
statements as of December 31, 2022 and for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are unaudited. The consolidated
balance sheet as of March 31, 2022 was derived from the audited balance sheet filed in the Company’s 2022 annual report on Form
10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The results of operations for the periods presented are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year. The accounting policies followed by the Company are set forth in
more detail in Note 2 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the Form 10-K. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America have been condensed or omitted in this Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. However, the disclosures
herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Form 10-K.
Investments .
The Company accounts for investments of less than 3% of any limited liability companies at cost . The Company has no control or significant
influence of the limited liability companies. The cost of the investment is recorded as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets and
when income from the investment is received, it is immediately recognized on the consolidated statements of operations.
Reclassifications .
Certain amounts in prior periods’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current period’s
presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations, retained earnings or net cash flows.
3.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The
Company’s asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) relate to the plugging of wells, the removal of facilities and equipment,
and site restoration on oil and gas properties. The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded in the period in which it is incurred,
discounted to its present value using the credit adjusted risk-free interest rate, and a corresponding amount capitalized by increasing
the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted each period until the liability is settled or the well
is sold, at which time the liability is removed. The related asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of our
oil and natural gas properties. The ARO is included in the consolidated balance sheets with the current portion being included in the
accounts payable and other accrued expenses.

following table provides a rollforward of the AROs for the first nine months of fiscal 2022:

5.
Long Term Debt
On
December 28, 2018, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the “Agreement”) with West Texas National Bank (“WTNB”),
which originally provided for a credit facility of $ 1,000,000
with a maturity date of
December 28, 2021 . The Agreement has no monthly
commitment reduction and a borrowing base to be evaluated annually.
On
February 28, 2020, the Agreement was amended to increase the credit facility to $ 2,500,000 , extend the maturity date to
March 28, 2023
and increase the borrowing base to $ 1,500,000 .
Under
the Agreement, interest on the credit facility accrues at a rate equal to the prime rate as quoted in the Wall Street Journal plus one-half
of one percent ( 0.5 % ) floating daily. Interest on the outstanding amount under the Agreement is payable monthly. In addition,
the Company
will pay an unused commitment fee in an amount equal to one-half of one percent ( 0.5 %) times the daily average of the unadvanced amount
of the commitment. The unused commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter . As of December
31, 2022, there was $ 1,500,000
available for borrowing by the Company on the facility.
No
principal payments are anticipated to be required through the maturity date of the credit facility,
March 28, 2023 . Upon closing with
WTNB on the original Agreement, the Company paid a
.5 % loan origination fee in the amount of $ 5,000
plus legal and recording expenses
totaling $ 34,532 , which were deferred over the original life of the credit facility. Upon closing the amendment to the Agreement, the
Company paid a
.1 % loan origination fee of $ 2,500
and an extension fee of $ 3,125
plus legal and recording expenses totaling $ 12,266 ,
which were also deferred over the life of the credit facility.
Amounts
borrowed under the Agreement are collateralized by the common stock of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries and substantially
all of the Company’s oil and gas properties.
The
Agreement contains customary covenants for credit facilities of this type including limitations on change in control, disposition of
assets, mergers and reorganizations. The Company is also obligated to meet certain financial covenants under the Agreement and requires
senior debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) ratios (Senior Debt/EBITDA) less
than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00 measured with respect to the four trailing quarters and minimum interest coverage ratios (EBITDA/Interest
Expense) of 2.00 to 1.00 for each quarter.
In
addition, this Agreement prohibits the Company from paying cash dividends on its common stock without written permission of WTNB. The
Agreement does not permit the Company to enter into hedge agreements covering crude oil and natural gas prices without prior WTNB approval.
There
was no balance outstanding on the line of credit as of December 31, 2022. The following table is a summary of activity on the WTNB line
of credit for the nine months ended December 31, 2022:

Leases
The
Company leases approximately
4,160
rentable square feet of office space from an unaffiliated third party for the corporate office located
in Midland, Texas. This includes
1,112
square feet of office space shared with and reimbursed by the majority shareholder. The lease
does not include an option to renew and is a
36 -month lease that was to expire in May 2021.
In June 2020, in exchange for a reduction
in rent for the months of June and July 2020, the Company agreed to a 2-month extension to its current lease agreement at the regular
monthly rate extending its current lease expiration date to July 2021 . In June 2021,
the Company agreed to extend its current lease at
a flat (unescalated) rate for 36 months.
The amended lease now expires on
July 31, 2024 .
The
Company determines an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are recorded in operating lease right-of-use asset, operating
lease liability, current, and operating lease liability, long-term on the consolidated balance sheets.
Operating
lease right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent
its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement
date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s lease does not provide an implicit rate,
the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value
of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate used at adoption was
3.75 % . Significant judgement is required when determining the
incremental borrowing rate. Rent expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The
balance sheets classification of lease assets and liabilities was as follows:

and $ 31,570 , respectively. Rent expense,
less sublease income of $ 11,679
and $ 14,662 , respectively, is included in general and administrative expenses.
7.
Income Taxes
A
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, is recognized when it is more likely than not that some
or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized. To assess that likelihood, we use estimates and judgment regarding
our future taxable income, and we consider the tax consequences in the jurisdiction where such taxable income is generated, to determine
whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence can include our current financial position, our results of operations, both
actual and forecasted, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies as well as the current and forecasted business
economics of our industry.
10
Based
on the material write-downs of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties during fiscal 2016, we are in a net deferred
tax asset position as of December 31, 2022. Our deferred tax asset for federal income tax purposes is $ 202,543
as of December 31, 2022
with a valuation amount of $ 202,543 . We believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management
considers the likelihood that the Company’s net operating losses and other deferred tax attributes will be utilized prior to their
expiration, if applicable. The determination to record a valuation allowance was based on management’s assessment of all available
evidence, both positive and negative, supporting realizability of the Company deferred tax asset as required by applicable accounting
standards. In light of those criteria for recognizing the tax benefit of deferred tax assets, the Company’s assessment resulted
in application of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2022.
8.
Related Party Transactions
Related
party transactions for the Company relate to shared office expenditures in addition to administrative and operating expenses paid on

office space directly to the lessor. Amounts paid by the principal stockholder directly to the lessor for the three months ending December
31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 3,893 . Amounts paid by the principal stockholder directly to the lessor for the nine months ending December 31,

Liquidity
and Capital Resources.
Historically, we have funded our operations, acquisitions, exploration and development expenditures from cash
generated by operating activities, bank borrowings, sales of non-core properties and issuance of common stock. Our primary financial
resource is our base of oil and gas reserves. We have pledged our producing oil and gas properties to secure our credit facility. We
do not have any delivery commitments to provide a fixed and determinable quantity of its oil and gas under any existing contract or agreement.
Our
long-term strategy is on increasing profit margins while concentrating on obtaining reserves with low cost operations by acquiring and
developing oil and gas properties with potential for long-lived production. We focus our efforts on the acquisition of royalties and
working interests in non-operated properties in areas with significant development potential.
At
December 31, 2022, we had working capital of $2,468,314 compared to working capital of $2,469,776 at March 31, 2022, a decrease of $1,462
for the reasons set forth below.

(884,360 )
(762,979 )
Cash
Flow Provided by Operating Activities.
Cash flow from operating activities is primarily derived from the production of our crude
oil and natural gas reserves and changes in the balances of non-cash accounts, receivables, payables or other non-energy property asset
account balances. Cash flow provided by our operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $4,350,920 in comparison
to $2,728,586 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. This increase of $1,622,334 in our cash flow operating activities consisted
of an increase in our non-cash expenses of $496,349; an increase in our accounts receivable of $639,657; and, an increase in our net
income for the current nine months of $1,898,037. Variations in cash flow from operating activities may impact our level of exploration
and development expenditures.
Our
expenditures in operating activities consist primarily of drilling expenses, production expenses and engineering services. Our expenses
also consist of employee compensation, accounting, insurance and other general and administrative expenses that we have incurred in order
to address normal and necessary business activities of a public company in the crude oil and natural gas production industry.
Cash
Flow Used in Investing Activities.
Cash flow from investing activities is derived from changes in oil and gas property balances.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we had net cash of $4,969,269 used for additions to oil and gas properties compared to $1,021,849
for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
Cash
Flow Provided by Financing Activities.
Cash flow from financing activities is derived from our changes in long-term debt and in equity
account balances. Cash flow used in our financing activities was $121,381 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to cash
flow used in our financing activities of $884,360 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. During the nine months ended December
31, 2022, we received advances and made repayments of $675,000 on our credit facility, received proceeds of $16,700 from the exercise
of director stock options, received payment of $30,179 from a director for profits on purchase of stock within the six-month window of
a previous stock sale, and expended $168,260 for the purchase of 12,416 shares of our stock for the treasury.
Accordingly,
net cash decreased $739,730, leaving cash and cash equivalents on hand of $631,036 as of December 31, 2022.
Oil

We
are participating in other projects and are reviewing projects in which we may participate. The cost of such projects would be funded,
to the extent possible, from existing cash balances and cash flow from operations. The remainder may be funded through borrowings on
the credit facility and, if appropriate, sales of non-core properties.
Crude
oil and natural gas generally remained volatile during the last year. The volatility of the energy markets makes it extremely difficult
to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. For example, in the last twelve months, the NYMEX West Texas
Intermediate (“WTI”) posted price for crude oil has ranged from a low of $67.00 per bbl in December 2022 to a high of $119.68
per bbl in March 2022. The Henry Hub Spot Market Price (“Henry Hub”) posted price for natural gas has ranged from a low of
$3.46 per MMBtu in November 2022 to a high of $9.85 per MMBtu in August 2022.
On
December 31, 2022, the WTI posted price for crude oil was $76.24 and the Henry Hub posted price for natural gas was $3.52. See Results
of Operations below for realized price.

Results
of Operations – Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, there was net income
of $1,244,785 compared to $753,302 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, a 65% increase as a result of an increase in operating revenues
due to an increase in oil and gas production and prices partially offset by an increase in operating expenses that is further explained
below.
Oil
and gas sales . Revenue from oil and gas sales was $2,486,017 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, a 58% increase from $1,573,984
for the same period of fiscal 2022. This resulted from an increase in oil and natural gas production volumes and an increase in oil price
partially offset by a decrease in natural gas price.

Production
and exploration.
Production costs were $478,670 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, a 64% increase from $291,068 for the same period
of fiscal 2022. This is primarily the result of an increase in production taxes and marketing charges as a result of the increase in
oil and gas revenues.
Depreciation,
depletion and amortization.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $496,509 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, an
85% increase from $268,018 for the same period of fiscal 2022, primarily due to an increase in production and full cost pool amortization
base partially offset by an increase in oil and gas reserves.
General
and administrative expenses.
General and administrative expenses were $288,536 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, a 20% increase
from $239,767 for the same period of fiscal 2022. This was primarily due to an increase in salaries, employee stock option compensation
and accounting fees.
Interest
expense.
Interest expense was $3,230 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, a 3% increase from $3,132 for the same period of fiscal
2022, due to an increase in interest rate.
Income
taxes.
Income tax expense was $61,986 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an 89% increase from $32,785 for the three months
ended December 31, 2021 consisting only of state income tax. This increase was due to our continuing development program primarily in
the State of New Mexico. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 5% and 4%, respectively. For
federal income tax purposes, we are in a net deferred tax asset position and believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax
assets will not be realized.
Results
of Operations – Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, there was a net
income of $3,755,173 compared to net income of $1,857,136 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. This was a result of an increase
in operating revenues due to an increase in oil and gas production volumes and prices partially offset by an increase in operating expenses
that is further explained below.

increase from $739,469 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. This was primarily due to an increase in employee stock option compensation,
salaries and contract services, and legal fees.
Interest
expense.
Interest expense was $9,770 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, a 58% decrease from $23,255 for the nine months
ended December 31, 2021 due to a decrease in borrowings.
Income
taxes.
Income tax expense was $115,236 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, a 108% increase from $55,492 for the nine months
ended December 31, 2021 consisting only of state income tax. This increase was due to our continuing development program primarily in
the State of New Mexico. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 3%. For federal income tax purposes,
we are in a net deferred tax asset position and believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The
primary sources of market risk for us include fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates. All of our financial instruments are
for purposes other than trading.
Credit
Risk.
Credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of nonperformance by other parties of their contractual obligations. Our primary
credit risk is related to oil and gas production sold to various purchasers and the receivables are generally not collateralized. At
December 31, 2022, our largest credit risk associated with any single purchaser was $1,255,427 or 61% of our total oil and gas receivables.
We have not experienced any significant credit losses.
Energy
Price Risk.
Our most significant market risk is the pricing applicable to our crude oil and natural gas production. Our financial
condition, results of operations, and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of, and demand for, oil
and natural gas. Prices for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years, and we expect this
volatility to continue in the future.
For
example, in the last twelve months, the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) posted price for crude oil has ranged from
a low of $67.00 per bbl in December 2022 to a high of $119.68 per bbl in March 2022. The Henry Hub Spot Market Price (“Henry Hub”)
posted price for natural gas has ranged from a low of $3.46 per MMBtu in November 2022 to a high of $9.85 per MMBtu in August 2022. On
December 31, 2022, the WTI posted price for crude oil was $76.24 and the Henry Hub posted price for natural gas was $3.52. See Results
of Operations above for the Company’s realized prices during the three and nine months. Subsequently, on January 24, 2023, the
WTI posted price for crude oil was $76.11 and the Henry Hub posted price for natural gas was $3.35.
Similarly,
any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition, results of operations and capital resources.
If the average oil price had increased or decreased by ten dollars per barrel for the first nine months of fiscal 2023, pretax income
would have changed by $500,520. If the average gas price had increased or decreased by one dollar per mcf for the first nine months of
fiscal 2023, pretax income would have changed by $394,293.
Item
4. Controls and Procedures

and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e). Based on such evaluation, such officers concluded that, as of December 31,
2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the nine
months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
