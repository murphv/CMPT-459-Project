NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2022   NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS     T-REX Acquisition Corp. (The “ Company ”) was formed on January 16, 2008, in the state of Nevada under the name Plethora Resources, Inc. as a development stage enterprise. The Company was originally organized to engage in the business of consulting to oil and gas exploration companies interested in obtaining exploration and production licenses at auction for oil and gas properties in Russia. The Company later changed its name to Sync2 Networks Corp when the Company began to engage in software-related services. On March 20, 2014, the Company changed its name to TREX Acquisition Corp. after the Company business operations under the Sync2 Networks branding had ceased. On June 21, 2021, the Company decided to pivot from seeking an acquisition candidate to operating a cryptocurrency mining business. On February 17, 2022, the Company began mining bitcoin at Ace Hosting, a Tampa, Florida located data center. On August 5, 2022, the Company changed its name to “T-REX Acquisition Corp.”    As of December31, 2022, the Company is a holding company with the following subsidiaries: Raptor Mining LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“ Raptor Mining ”); and TRXA Merger Sub, Inc., an inactive Delaware corporation (“ Merger Sub ”). On July 1, 2022, we incorporated Megalodon Mining and Electric, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“ Megalodon ”), which is also a dormant entity.     2020 TRXA Merger Sub Inc.      On March 13, 2020, the Company incorporated the Merger Sub in order to facilitate the acquisition of a pre-revenue Software-as-a-Service internet platform business. The Company’s sole Officer and Director currently serves as the sole officer and director of the Merger Sub. As of the date of this filing, neither the Company nor the Merger Sub have entered into a definitive agreement or non-binding letter of intent to acquire a company and Merger Sub is an inactive subsidiary of the Company.    2021 Raptor Mining LLC and 2022 Megalodon Mining and Electric LLC     On July 9, 2021, the Company formed Raptor Mining in order to pursue the Company’s new business operating strategy to engage in cryptocurrency mining, which is used to secure decentralized network protocols and decentralized distributed ledgers. On July 1, 2022, the Company formed Megalodon to investigate and potentially pursue a cryptocurrency co-location business model. The cryptocurrency co-location business model is based on a company, which has access to data centers and inexpensive cryptocurrency mining inputs, such as low-cost electricity supply, offering to host third-party owned cryptocurrency mining equipment in exchange for a fee, which may consist of a mix of cash and cryptocurrency consideration. As of the date of this quarterly filing, the Company has commenced researching the acquisition of land to begin offering co-location services to other cryptocurrency miner owners.    These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s fiscal year end June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2021, respectively. The Company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read, or have access to, the audited financial statements for the preceding period, and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. The results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year ending June 30, 2023.     F-5 Table of Contents   NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation   The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Determination of Bad Debts   The Company’s policy is to analyze the collectability of Accounts and Notes Receivable on a monthly basis to determine whether any allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary. Once the allowance has been determined the offset is booked to bad debt expense and subsequently if the account is deemed to be a bad debt, it is written off the allowance for doubtful accounts.
Principles of Consolidation
As of December 31, 2022, the accounts include those of the Company and its
100 % owned subsidiaries, Merger Sub, Raptor Mining and Megalodon Mining and Electric. These entities are inactive and without balances. As a result, there were no intercompany transactions or balances to be eliminated.   On March 13, 2020, the Company incorporated Merger Sub in order to facilitate the acquisition of a pre-revenue Software-as-a-Service internet platform business. The Company’s sole Officer and Director currently serves as the sole officer and director of the Merger Sub. As of the date of this filing, neither the Company nor the Merger Sub have entered into a definitive agreement or non-binding letter of intent to acquire a company. On July 9, 2021, the Company organized Raptor Mining, which currently generates revenues via its operating business.  On July 1, 2022, the Company formed Megalodon to investigate and potentially pursue a cryptocurrency co-location business model. The cryptocurrency co-location business model is based on a company, which has access to data centers and inexpensive cryptocurrency mining inputs, such as low-cost electricity supply, offering to host third-party owned cryptocurrency mining equipment in exchange for a fee, which may consist of a mix of cash and cryptocurrency consideration. As of the date of this quarterly filing, the Company has commenced researching the acquisition of land to begin offering co-location services to other cryptocurrency miner owners.    Use of estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Cash equivalents   The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.     F-6 Table of Contents   Fair value of financial instruments   The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.) GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:   Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.   Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company’s notes payable approximate the fair value of such instruments based upon management’s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements as of December 31, 2022.   The assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet approximate their fair value.   Equipment   Equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of equipment is computed by the straight-line method (after taking into account their respective estimated residual values) over the assets estimated useful life of three ( 3 ) or seven ( 7 ) years. Upon sale or retirement of equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in statements of operations. Equipment consists solely of bitcoin miners used in the operation. The equipment value is based on the cost and the potential impairment is reviewed periodically and as of June 30, 2022, there was no impairment of any of the mining equipment. The depreciation expense for the three and six months ended December 31. 2022, was $ 19,188
and $ 36,191
respectively. Depreciation expense for the three and six months ended December 31. 2021, was $- 0 - and $- 0 - respectively.   Stock based compensation   The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Section 718 Compensation – Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718 stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expensed ratably over the requisite service period/vesting period.
The company accounts for its non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with Update 2018-07—Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
Commitments and contingencies   The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Since September 30, 2022, and through the date of filing, there have been no intervening lawsuits, claims or judgments filed.     F-7 Table of Contents   Revenue recognition   The Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the new revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:   · Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer     · Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract     · Step 3: Determine the transaction price     · Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract     · Step 5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation   The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both.
When determining the transaction price, an entity must consider the effects of all of the following:   · Variable consideration     · Constraining estimates of variable consideration     · The existence of a significant financing component in the contract     · Noncash consideration     · Consideration payable to a customer
Crypto asset transaction verification is the output generated from the Company’s ordinary activities. The consideration the Company receives is a bitcoin reward, which the Company measures rewards received from mining at their fair value on the date received. Rewards are earned when the Company successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm). As a result, the Company receives confirmation from the mining pool of the block being placed and a reward/s earned. The Company uses the quoted price of the bitcoin at closing on the date the coin is mined to value its reward/s.  There is no significant financing component in these transactions.
Expenses associated with running the digital currency mining business, such as rent, and electricity cost are also recorded as cost of revenues. Depreciation on digital currency mining equipment is recorded as a component of cost of revenues.
Digital currencies - Bitcoin   Bitcoin is included as a non-current, intangible asset in the balance sheets. It is recorded at cost less impairment. If it is determined that more likely than not an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.  The Bitcoin’s cost is accounted for using FIFO cost basis.  Rewards in bitcoin are earned for mining activity.  The reward a bitcoin miner earns changes roughly every four years, or after every 210,000 blocks are mined and gets reduced by half each time; this whole process is called bitcoin halving. The last halving occurred on May 11, 2020, and reduced the reward per block to 6.25 BTC.
F-8 Table of Contents   Income taxes   Federal Income taxes are not currently due since we have had losses since inception.   Income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to ASC 740-10-25
Income Taxes – Recognition.
Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the “more likely than not” standard required by ASC 740-10-25-5.   Deferred income tax amounts reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes.   As of December 31, 2022, we had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $( 5,167,519 ) and a deferred tax asset of $ 1,081,179
using the statutory rate of
21 %. The deferred tax asset may be recognized in future periods, not to exceed 20 years. However, due to the uncertainty of future events we have booked valuation allowance of $( 1,081,179 ). FASB ASC 740 prescribes recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FASB ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had not taken any tax positions that would require disclosure under FASB ASC 740.       December 31, 2022     June 30, 2022   Deferred Tax Asset   $ 1,081,179     $ 873,759   Valuation Allowance     ( 1,081,179 )     ( 873,759 ) Deferred Tax Asset (net)   $ -     $ -     Due to the changes the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, net operating loss carryforwards for Federal Income tax reporting purposes are subject to additional limitations. Should certain changes in ownership occur, our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited to use in future years. In addition, tax rates on corporations were reduced and certain other deductions limited. These changes may affect the income tax benefit calculation and related allowance during subsequent fiscal years.   Net income (loss) per common share   Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented.   There were outstanding warrants that could convert into
3,285,332
shares of common stock as of December31, 2022. At the end of both periods the potentially dilutive shares were excluded because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.     F-9 Table of Contents   Cash flows reporting   The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (“Indirect method”) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.   Advertising Costs   The Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotional materials when incurred. Total Advertising costs were zero for all periods.   Par value of common stock   The par value of common stock was previously reported at $ 0.001
and was adjusted to $ 0.0001
resulting in an adjustment from common stock to additional paid in capital, with no change to total equity.   Subsequent events   The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer, considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.   NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN   As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $ 1,006,762
during the six months ended December 31, 2022, and had an accumulated deficit of $ 5,167,519
and a working capital deficit of ($ 173,041 ) as of December 31, 2022.
While the Company is attempting to generate greater revenues, the Company’s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company’s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect and there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate revenues.   The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.     F-10 Table of Contents   NOTE 4 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition or Plan of Operation .   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, significant uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed, or implied, by those forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of the words may, will, should, could, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, intends, potential, proposed, or continue or the negative of those terms. These statements are only predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the exceptions reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.   In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China and has spread throughout the United States and the rest of the world. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak to constitute a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” This contagious disease outbreak, which has not been contained, and is disrupting supply chains and affecting production and sales across a range of industries in United States and other companies as a result of quarantines, facility closures, and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak, as well as the worldwide adverse effect to workforces, economies, and financial markets, leading to a global economic downturn. Therefore, the Company expects this matter to negatively impact its operating results. However, the related financial impact and duration cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.   RESULTS OF OPERATION   Our revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was $11,958 compared to $0 for the same period in 2021.
Our revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2022, was $37,387 compared to $0 for the same period in 2021.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   As of December 31, 2022, our current assets were $101,412 and our current liabilities were $274,453 which resulted in a working capital deficit of $173,041.

PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING   We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our proceeds from the sales of stock and generation of revenues from acquisitions. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.   Our principal demands for liquidity are to increase business operations and for general corporate purposes. We intend to meet our liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to future business operations, and the expansion of our business, through cash flow provided by funds raised through proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity.      4 Table of Contents   MATERIAL COMMITMENTS   Convertible Debenture   None .    PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT   During the next twelve months, the Company intends to acquire between fifty (50) and one hundred and fifty (150) ASIC miners per quarter. Although pricing for ASIC miners is generally directly related to the price of bitcoin, ASIC miners as of this Annual Report cost between $2,500 and $6,000 per ASIC miner.    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES     Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.     We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.    OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.   GOING CONCERN     The independent auditors’ report accompanying our June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2021, financial statements contain an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared “assuming that we will continue as a going concern,” which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. We have suffered recurring losses from operations and have a working capital deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.    RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS     Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.    We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.    Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk.   We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.    Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   We maintain controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based upon their evaluation of those controls and procedures performed as of the end of the periods covered by this report, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.     5 Table of Contents   MANAGEMENT’S QUARTERLY REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   Our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:   · Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; · Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors; and · Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the 1992 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“2013 COSO”) in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework.   Based on our assessment, our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer believes that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective based on those criteria, due to the following:   · Deficiencies in Segregation of Duties. Lack of proper segregation of functions, duties, and responsibilities with respect to our cash and control over the disbursements related thereto due to our very limited staff, including our accounting personnel. Deficiencies in the staffing of our financial accounting department. The number of qualified accounting personnel with experience in public company SEC reporting and GAAP is limited. This weakness does not enable us to maintain adequate controls over our financial accounting and reporting processes regarding the accounting for non-routine and non-systematic transactions. There is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused, or at least not be detected in a timely manner, by this shortage of qualified resources.   In light of this conclusion and as part of the preparation of this report, we have applied compensating procedures and processes as necessary to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting. Accordingly, management believes, based on its knowledge, that (1) this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material face necessary to make the statements made not misleading with respect to the periods covered by this report, and (2) the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the years and periods then ended.   This report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report in this report.   CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   There were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     6 Table of Contents   PART II—OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1.
