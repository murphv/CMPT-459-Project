BASIS OF PRESENTATION, ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
regarding interim financial reporting and reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. Certain
information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or
omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. As such, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on June 29, 2022. The results from operations for the three and nine-month
periods ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2023. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the
financial position, results of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows at June 30, 2022 and for all periods presented herein
have been made.
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in the Company’s financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results
could materially differ from those estimates.
Organization
and Nature of Operations
Sundance
Strategies, Inc. (formerly known as Java Express, Inc.) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 14, 2001, and
engaged in the retail selling of beverage products to the general public until these endeavors ceased in 2006; it had no material business
operations from 2006, until its acquisition of ANEW LIFE, INC. (“ANEW LIFE”), a subsidiary of Sundance Strategies, Inc. (“Sundance
Strategies”, “the Company”, “we” or “our”).
Our
historical business model has focused on purchasing or acquiring life insurance policies and residual interests in or financial products
tied to life insurance policies, including notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable and other obligations representing part
of or all of the sales price of insurance, life settlements and related insurance contracts being traded in the secondary marketplace,
often referred to as the “life settlements market.”
During
the latter part of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the Company began developing an additional business offering, providing professional
services to specialty structured finance groups, bond issuers and life settlement aggregators. The Company has now assembled an experienced
team from the life settlement marketplace, as well as from other areas such as financial services and public financial markets. As a
professional services provider, the Company applies industry best practices to advise on the selection of specific portfolios of life
insurance policies that are tailored to meet the needs of its clients. The Company’s clients may include bond issuers, bond investors,
or other structured finance product issuers. The Company has developed strategies and methodologies which include the acquisition of
life insurance portfolios, then uses common structured finance techniques and proprietary analytics to structure bonds for issuances,
including principal protected bonds. The Company’s goal is to deliver long-term value and profitability to shareholders by growing the
Company’s professional services business and asset base, resulting in the ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.

During
the latter part of the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company began working closely with bond placement agents and aggregators to establish
various aspects of a proprietary, investment grade bond offering. In this arrangement, the Company participates as the sole originator
in the role of structuring and advising on the structure of the proprietary bond instrument. Included in the role of structuring financial
assets, the Company uses proprietary analytics to establish the makeup of the rated instrument, including but not limited to, life settlement
assets (life insurance policies) and managed cash, and implements a process of selective assembly of the underlying assets and cash management
that will meet the policy requirements and analytics. The Company continues to provide current and ongoing resources for all analytics,
as well as advisement support for the investment and non-investment grade ratings for the managed asset pool and the managed cash accounts.
Acting in an advisory role, the Company is reimbursed for all expenses associated with the structuring and preparation of any bond offering,
will receive an advisory payment upon the closing of any bond offering, and then will hold residual rights on the balance of assets once
the bond is retired.
During
the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company and US Capital Global Securities LLC, an affiliate of US Capital Global, entered into an arrangement
wherein the Company is the lead advisor and lead originator of tailored life insurance portfolios to be used in a life insurance-linked
bond offering (“bond offering”) of between $ 250
million to $ 500
million. US Capital Global Securities LLC is the lead placement
agent and is marketing the bond offering on behalf of the issuer on a best-efforts basis to qualified investors. The Company has worked
with Egan Jones rating agency to obtain a minimum of BBB plus to an A minus rating on the bond offering. This initial rating is based
upon a sample portfolio of life settlement assets similar to those expected to be utilized in the bond offering. Once a percentage of
the bond offering is in escrow, then the actual life settlement portfolios will be purchased and held until the bond offering closes.
Once the final group of assets are assembled, then a final rating will be obtained. The Company has engaged a licensed asset manager,
whose projected returns will be approved by the rating agency. Important for the success of the bond is the treatment of the various
cash accounts that will support the bond. The two primary accounts will be the Investment account and the Cash Reserve account. These
accounts will represent approximately
40 %
of the total cash raised from the bond offering. The Investment and Cash Reserve accounts are
projected to produce sufficient annual returns to support the cost associated to maintain the bonds. A nationally recognized trust manager
has been engaged to insure all the workings of the bond are handled properly and timely. An actuarial company has also been engaged to
provide the modeling needed for the rating agency, asset manager and bond issuer. For services provided, the Company will receive a fee
upon the closing on the bond offering and will also hold a residual monetary right to cash flows from the life settlement assets once
the bond is retired.
On
January 1, 2022, the Company entered into a marketing and consulting agreement with Tradability, LLC (“Consultant”) that
requires the Company to make an initial $ 100,000
payment and up to an additional $ 400,000
in the future (which will be financed by the
Consultant via a promissory note). The $ 400,000
obligation is contingent upon the Consultant and the Company successfully reaching certain
milestones. Further, the agreement requires the Company to issue between
1,000,000
and
10,000,000
stock options (which are exercisable
into the Company’s common stock at prices between $ 1.00
to $ 2.50
per share) contingent upon the Consultant and the Company successfully
reaching certain milestones. The milestones primarily relate to the Consultant finalizing the tokenization of
500
million non-fungible
tokens (“NFTs”) and the successful placement of NFTs with proceeds of between $ 100
million and $ 500
million. The proceeds
will be used to purchase Life Settlements for which the Company will be an advisor. As of December 31, 2022, none of the milestones related
to the potential issuance of equity have been met; and no assurance can be given that these anticipated milestones will be reached.
In
addition to the arrangements described above, management of the Company is actively seeking additional bonding and financing opportunities
that would allow the Company to leverage its unique position within the life-settlements market, and lead to future revenue opportunities.
To be able to quickly pivot to any of these additional opportunities, the Company has been actively seeking to secure additional bond
ratings from other bond rating agencies to expand its attractiveness within the marketplace.

have been no changes to the significant accounting policies of the Company from the information provided in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated

Basic
and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share
Basic
net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods
presented using the treasury stock method. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by including common shares that may be issued
subject to existing rights with dilutive potential, when applicable. Potential dilutive common stock equivalents are primarily comprised
of potential dilutive shares resulting from convertible debt agreements and common stock warrants. Potentially dilutive shares resulting
from convertible debt agreements are evaluated using the if-converted method. Potentially dilutive securities are not included in the
calculation of diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, because to do so would be anti-dilutive.
Potentially dilutive securities outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are comprised of warrants convertible into
7,873,990
and
4,958,754
shares of common stock, respectively.
New
Accounting Pronouncements
Adopted
During the Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022
In
May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04 Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity Classified
Written Call Options. This ASU clarifies an issuer’s accounting for certain modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified
written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. Specifically, it provides
a principles-based framework to determine whether an issuer should recognize the modification or exchange as an adjustment to equity
or an expense. The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods therein. The Company
adopted the new guidance as of April 1, 2022 and used the framework to record modification to the exercise price of equity classified
warrants during the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
Not
Yet Adopted
The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards, in order to determine their effects, if any, on
its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Based on that review, the Company believes that none of these pronouncements
will have a significant effect on its financial statements.
(2)
LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND GOING CONCERN
Since
the Company’s inception on January 31, 2013, operations have been primarily financed through sales of equity, debt financing from
related parties and the issuance of notes payable and convertible debentures. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 3,158
of cash
assets, compared to $ 267,966
as of March 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had access to draw an additional $ 4,492,192
on
the notes payable, related party (see Note 6) and $ 3,000,000
on the Convertible Debenture Agreement (See Note 7). For the nine months
ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s average monthly operating expenses were approximately $ 58,500 , which includes salaries of our
employees, consulting agreements and contract labor, general and administrative expenses and legal and accounting expenses. In addition
to the monthly operating expenses, the Company continues to pursue other debt and equity financing opportunities, and as a result, financing
expenses of $ 13,500
were incurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022. As management continues to explore additional financing
alternatives, beginning January 1, 2023, the Company is expected to spend up to an additional $ 385,000   on these efforts. Outstanding
Accounts Payable as of December 31, 2022 totaled $ 698,797 . Management has concluded that its existing capital resources and availability
under its existing convertible debentures and debt agreements with related parties will be sufficient to fund its operating working capital
requirements for at least the next 12 months, or through February 2024. Related parties have given assurance that their continued support,
by way of either extensions of due dates, or increases in lines-of-credit, can be relied on. As mentioned above, the Company also continues
to evaluate other debt and equity financing opportunities.
The
outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has since spread to multiple countries, including the United States
and several European countries. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic
is affecting the United States and global economies and may affect the Company’s operations and those of third parties on which
the Company relies. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to assess
or predict, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global financial markets may reduce the Company’s ability to access capital,
which could negatively impact the Company’s short-term and long-term liquidity. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is
highly uncertain and subject to change. The Company does not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on its business,
financing or other activities or on healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material
impact on the Company’s liquidity, capital resources, operations and business and those of the third parties on which we rely.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
As
defined by ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), fair value is the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. ASC 820 also requires the consideration of differing levels of inputs in the determination of fair values.
Those
levels of input are summarized as follows:
●
Level
1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
●
Level
2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices
for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant
assumptions are observable in the market.
●
Level
3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments
whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques as well as instruments
for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
The
level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that
is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The
Company did not have any transfers of assets and liabilities between Levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy during
the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Other
Financial Instruments
The
Company’s recorded values of cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
approximate their fair values based on their short-term nature. The recorded values of the notes payable and convertible debenture approximate
the fair values as the interest rate approximates market interest rates.
(4)
STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Common
Stock
Effective
December 6, 2018, three existing stockholders have contributed to the Company a portion of their common shares held at a repurchase price
to the Company of $ 0.05
per share. The Company has cancelled the acquired shares, which decreased the outstanding common shares on the
books of the Company. The total number of common shares canceled/retired was
8,000,000 . Of the
8,000,000
shares,
6,000,000
were owned
by a related party to the Company. The total liability related to the repurchase of these shares is $ 400,000 , with repayment to the related
party stockholders contingent on a major financing event. Of the $ 400,000
liability, $ 300,000
is to a related party.

Warrants
to Purchase Common Stock
The
Company’s related party lenders consist of: the Chairman of the Board of Directors and a stockholder, Radiant Life, LLC and Mr.
Dickman, a board member and stockholder. These holders of the related party unsecured promissory notes, hold agreements that provide
each related party with common stock warrants upon the lender’s extension of a maturity due date or upon the loaning of additional
monies.
The number of warrants issued for an extension is based on the following formula: 10,000 warrants per month the due date is extended
plus 1 warrant for every $2 of the principal balance outstanding (not including interest) at the time of the extension (rounded to the
nearest whole warrant) . Upon the loaning of additional monies, the lender will also require 2 warrants for each dollar loaned. All warrants
issued under these terms vested immediately upon issuance, have an exercise price approximately equal to the fair value of the Company’s
common stock on the date of grant, and expire
5 years
from the date of issuance.
On
June 20, 2022, the Company amended the agreements with the related party lenders to adjust the exercise price of the warrants issued
in conjunction with extensions of due dates and new monies lent on the outstanding notes payable, related parties from
January 5, 2022
to February 5, 2022 . The original agreements stated that the exercise price of the warrants issued was $ 0.05 . The amended agreements
adjust the exercise price from $ 0.05
to $ 1.05 , which is the estimated fair market value of the common stock on the grant dates of the
warrants. The original agreements inadvertently stated an exercise price of $ 0.05 , when the Company had intended to grant warrants with
an exercise price of $ 1.05 . This modification was evaluated and it was determined that the increase in exercise price resulted in a decrease
in the fair value of the warrants issued from January 5, 2022 to February 5, 2022, and therefore no additional warrant expense was required.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, and per the provisions outlined above,
the Company agreed
to provide Mr. Dickman with warrants for
399,749
shares of common stock in conjunction with the extension of the due date of the outstanding
promissory notes and agreed to provide the Chairman of the Board of Directors and a stockholder with warrants for
224,000
shares of common
stock in conjunction with the Company borrowing $ 112,000
under the respective note payable and line of credit agreement (see note
6). The exercise price of the warrants issued during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $ 1.05 . The value of the warrants on
the date of grant, as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model, was $ 589,858 . The inputs used in these calculations included
a fair value of the underlying common stock of
$ 1.049
per share, a risk-free of between
3.84 %
and
4.31 % , volatility of between
142.23 %
and
143.97 %
and a dividend rate of
0 % . The Company determined the cost of debt issuance
to be $ 211,922 , to be amortized quarterly through November 30, 2022 (the due date of the lender’s line of credit at the time of
the borrowing event). As such, $ 52,980
of debt discount was amortized as interest expense during the quarter ended December 31, 2022.
The remaining $ 377,936
of expense, related to Mr. Dickman’s warrants, was recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt.

NOTES PAYABLE
On
April 6, 2021, the Company borrowed $ 300,000
under an unsecured promissory note with Satco International, Ltd. This promissory note bears
interest at a rate of
8 %
annually and was due
January 6, 2023 . In conjunction with this note, the Company issued warrants for
1,000,000
shares of common stock, exercisable at $ 1.00
per share and expiring in
3
years from the date of the promissory note. On February 2, 2023,
the unsecured promissory note with Satco International, Ltd. was amended to extend the due date from
January 6, 2023 to April 6, 2023 ,
or at the immediate time when alternative financing or other proceeds are received. This extension has no bearing on the warrants that
were issued in conjunction with the original promissory note. This note is separate from the

This
discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital
resources at and during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. For a complete understanding, this Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes to
the Financial Statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March
31, 2022.
Forward-looking
Statements
This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) that are based on management’s
beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. For this purpose any statement contained in this report
that is not a statement of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking, including, but not limited to, statements relating to
our future actions, intentions, plans, strategies, objectives, results of operations, cash flows and the adequacy of or need to seek
additional capital resources and liquidity. Without limiting the foregoing, words such as “ may ”, “ should ”,
“ expect ”, “ project ”, “ plan ”, “ anticipate ”, “ believe ”,
“ estimate ”, “ intend ”, “ budget ”, “ forecast ”, “ predict ”,
“ potential ”, “ continue ”, “ should ”, “ could ”, “ will ”
or comparable terminology or the negative of such terms are intended to identify forward-looking statements, however, the absence of
these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These statements by their nature involve known and unknown
risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially depending on a variety of factors,
many of which are not within our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, economic conditions generally and in the industry

products or services less competitive or obsolete; our failure to successfully develop new products and/or services or to anticipate
current or prospective customers’ needs; price increases; employee limitations; or delays, reductions, or cancellations of contracts
we have previously entered into; sufficiency of working capital, capital resources and liquidity and other factors detailed herein and
in our other filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC” or “Commission”). Should
one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially
from those indicated.
Forward-looking
statements are predictions and not guarantees of future performance or events. Forward-looking statements are based on current industry,
financial and economic information which we have assessed but which by its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly abrupt
changes. Our actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by such forward-looking statements due to risks and
uncertainties associated with our business. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we nor any other person
assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward-looking statements and we hereby qualify all our forward-looking
statements by these cautionary statements.
These
forward-looking statements speak only as of their dates and should not be unduly relied upon. We undertake no obligation to amend this
report or revise publicly these forward-looking statements (other than pursuant to reporting obligations imposed on registrants pursuant
to the Exchange Act) to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, whether as the result of new information, future events or otherwise.
The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report
and in our other filings with the Commission.
Overview
Our
historical business model has focused on purchasing or acquiring life insurance policies and residual interests in or financial products
tied to life insurance policies, including notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable and other obligations representing part
or all of the sales price of insurance, life settlements and related insurance contracts being traded in the secondary marketplace, often
referred to as the “life settlements market.”
14
We
currently do not hold life settlement or life insurance policies but, rather, previously held a contractual right to receive the net
insurance benefits, or “NIBs”, from a portfolio of life insurance policies held by a third party (“the Owners”
or “the Holders”). These NIBs represented an indirect, residual ownership interest in a portfolio of individual life insurance
policies, and they allowed us to receive a portion of the settlement proceeds from such policies, after expenses related to the acquisition,
financing, insuring and servicing of the policies underlying our NIBs have been paid.
NIBs
are generally sold by an entity that holds the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies, either directly or indirectly through
a subsidiary, such an entity being referred to herein as a “Holder.” A Holder, either directly or through a wholly owned
subsidiary, purchases life insurance policies either from the insured or on the secondary market and aggregates them into a portfolio
of policies. At the time of purchase, the Holder also (i) contracts with a service provider to manage the servicing of the policies until
maturity, (ii) consider purchasing mortality re-insurance (“MRI”) coverage under which payments will be made to the Holder
in the event the insurance policies do not mature according to actuarial life expectancies, and (iii) arranges financing to cover the
initial purchase of the insurance policies, the servicing of the life insurance policies until maturity and the payment of the MRI premiums.
The financing obtained by the Holder for a portfolio of life settlement or life insurance policies is secured by the insurance policies
for which the financing was obtained. After a Holder purchases policies, aggregates them into a portfolio and arranges for the servicing,
MRI coverage and financing, the Holder contracts to sell NIBs related to the policies, which gives the holder of the NIBs the right to
receive the proceeds from the settlement of the insurance policies after all of the expenses related to such policies have been paid.
When an insurance policy underlying our NIBs comes to maturity, the insurance proceeds are first used to pay expenses associated with
such policy. Once all of the expenses have been paid, the Holder will retain a small percentage of the proceeds and then will pay the
remaining insurance proceeds to us.
During
the latter part of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we began developing an additional business offering, providing professional
services to specialty structured finance groups, bond issuers and life settlement aggregators. We have assembled an experienced team
from the life settlement marketplace, as well as from other areas such as financial services and public financial markets. As a professional
services provider, we apply industry best practices to advise on the selection of specific portfolios of life insurance policies that
are tailored to meet the needs of its clients. Our clients may include bond issuers, bond investors, or other structured finance product
issuers. We have developed strategies and methodologies which include the acquisition of life insurance portfolios, then use common structured
finance techniques and proprietary analytics to structure bonds for issuances, including principal protected bonds. Our goal is to deliver
long-term value and profitability to shareholders by growing our professional services business and asset base, resulting in the ability
to pay dividends to its shareholders.
During
the latter part of the year ended March 31, 2021, we began working closely with bond placement agents and aggregators to establish various
aspects of a proprietary, investment grade bond offering. In this arrangement, we participate as the sole originator in the role of structuring
and advising on the structure of the proprietary bond instrument. Included in the role of structuring financial assets, we use proprietary
analytics to establish the makeup of the rated instrument, including but not limited to, life settlement assets (life insurance policies)
and managed cash, and implements a process of selective assembly of the underlying assets and cash management that will meet the policy
requirements and analytics. We provide current and ongoing resources for all analytics, as well as advisement support for the investment
and non-investment grade ratings for the managed asset pool and the managed cash accounts. In our advisory role, we are reimbursed for
all expenses associated with the structuring and preparation of any bond offering, will receive an advisory payment upon the closing
of any bond offering, and then will hold residual rights on the balance of assets once the bond is retired.
15
During
the year ended March 31, 2022, we and US Capital Global Securities LLC, an affiliate of US Capital Global, entered into an arrangement
wherein we are the lead advisor and lead originator of tailored life insurance portfolios to be used in a life insurance-linked bond
offering (“bond offering”) of between $250 million to $500 million. US Capital Global Securities LLC is the lead placement
agent and is marketing the bond offering on behalf of the issuer on a best-efforts basis to qualified investors. We have worked with
Egan Jones rating agency to obtain a minimum of BBB plus to an A minus rating on the bond offering. This initial rating projection is
based upon a sample portfolio of life settlement assets similar to those expected to be utilized in the bond offering. Once a percentage
of the bond offering is in escrow, then the actual life settlement portfolios will be purchased and held until the bond offering closes.
Once the final group of assets are assembled, then a final rating will be obtained. We have engaged a licensed asset manager, whose projected
returns will be approved by the rating agency. Important for the success of the bond is the treatment of the various cash accounts that
will support the bond. The two primary accounts will be the Investment account and the Cash Reserve account. These accounts will represent
approximately 40% of the total cash raised from the bond offering. The Investment and Cash Reserve accounts are projected to produce
sufficient annual returns to support the cost associated to maintain the bonds. A nationally recognized trust manager has been engaged
to insure all the workings of the bond are handled properly and timely. An actuarial company has also been engaged to provide the modeling
needed for the rating agency, asset manager and bond issuer. For services provided, we will receive a fee upon the closing on the bond
offering and will also hold a residual monetary right to cash flows from the life settlement assets once the bond is retired.
On
January 1, 2022, we entered into a marketing and consulting agreement with Tradability, LLC (“Consultant”) that requires
us to make an initial $100,000 payment and up to an additional $400,000 in the future (which will be financed by the Consultant via a
promissory note). The $400,000 obligation is contingent upon the Consultant and us successfully reaching certain milestones. Further,
the agreement requires us to issue between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 stock options (which are exercisable into our common stock at prices
between $1.00 to $2.50 per share) contingent upon the Consultant and us successfully reaching certain milestones. The milestones primarily
relate to the Consultant finalizing the tokenization of 500 million non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) and the successful placement
of NFTs with proceeds of between $100 million and $500 million. The proceeds will be used to purchase Life Settlements for which we will
be an advisor. As of June 30, 2022 none of the milestones related to the potential issuance of equity have been met
and
no assurance can be given that these anticipated milestones will be reached.
In
addition to the arrangements described above, we are actively seeking additional bonding and financing opportunities that would allow
us to leverage our unique position within the life-settlements market, and lead to future revenue opportunities. To be able to quickly
pivot to any of these additional opportunities, we have been actively seeking to secure an additional bond rating from another industry
recognized rating agencies to expand our potential within the marketplace.
Our
active board of directors continues to provide valuable industry expertise to the Company, including providing strategic insights and
direction, leveraging their relationships within the financial community to provide potential financing opportunities, and extending
valuable operational support through frequent and informal planning sessions.
Plan
of Operations
Life
Settlements is not a market sector without competition and, at present, we are a minor competitor. We will need substantial additional
funds to effectively compete in this industry and no assurance can be given that we will be able to adequately fund our current and intended
operations through debt or equity financing. The Company has no current source of operating revenues. When we hold NIBs we may be required
to expend funds on premiums, interest and servicing costs to protect our interest in NIBs, though we have no legal responsibility nor
adequate funds for these payments. In the event that neither party fulfils the financial obligations pertaining to the premiums, interest
and servicing costs, we would be required to evaluate our investment in NIBs for possible adverse impairment.
16
When
we hold NIBs, we use an estimation methodology to project cash flows and returns as presented. The estimation model requires many assumptions,
including, but not limited to the following: (i) an assumption that the distinct number of lives in our portfolio would exhibit similar
experience to a statistically diverse portfolio from which mortality tables have been created; (ii) an assumption that the life expectancies
(the “LE” or “LEs”) provided by LE providers represent the actuarial mean of the life expectancies of the insureds
in our portfolio, (iii) the weighted average of the LEs provided by the LE providers represents an appropriate method for adjusting for
discrepancies in the LEs; (iv) life expectancy tables and projections are accurate; (v) the minimum premiums calculated based on the
in-force illustrations provided by life insurance carriers are accurate and will not change over the course of the lifetime of our portfolio;
and (vi) the Holders’ Lender fees, MRI fees, and insurance, servicing and custodial fees will not change materially over time.
While this method of modeling cash flows is helpful in providing a theoretical expectation of potential returns that might be produced
from our NIBs portfolio, actual cash flows and returns inevitably will be different (possibly materially) due to the fact that predicting
the exact date of death of any individual is virtually impossible. The provision of a theoretical cash flow model is by no means any
guarantee of any results. The actual performance of these NIB interests (as well as our future expectations as to what such performance
might be) may differ substantially from our expectations, especially if any of the assumptions change or differ from our initial assumptions.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Since
our inception our operations have been primarily financed through sales of equity instruments, debt financing, lines of credit and notes
payable from related and unrelated parties and the issuance of convertible debentures. As of December 31, 2022, we had $3,158 of cash,
compared to $267,966 as of March 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had access to draw an additional $4,492,192 on the notes
payable, related party and $3,000,000 on the Convertible Debenture Agreement. Our monthly expenses are anticipated to be approximately
$70,000, which includes salaries of our employees, policy servicing expenses, consulting agreements and contract labor, general and administrative
expenses, and estimated legal and accounting expenses. Outstanding Accounts Payable as of December 31, 2022 totaled $698,797, short term
notes payable totaled $300,000, short term notes payable to related parties totaled $717,058, net of debt discounts, and other accrued
short term liabilities totaled $514,916. We believe that our availability under our existing lines of credit with related parties, our
existing capital resources, together with the issuance of additional notes payable and convertible debentures will be sufficient to fund
our operating working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, or through February 2024.
Debt
At
December 31, 2022, we owed $4,557,319, including accrued interest and exclusive of debt discounts, for debt obligations. We owed $3,113,808
in principal pursuant to notes payable and lines-of-credits from related parties, $300,000 in other notes payable, and had fully paid
off the principal owing on the 8% Convertible Debenture. As of December 31, 2022, one note payable and line-of-credit had a principal
balance of $1,059,508 and is due on November 30, 2024, or when the Company completes a successful equity raise, at which time principal
and interest is due in full. The second note payable and line-of-credit had a principal balance of $1,178,300, and the line of credit
is currently extended through November 30, 2024. At December 31, 2022, promissory notes with related parties had principal balances totaling
$826,000, and are due July 31, 2023. The convertible debenture agreement, which has no principal balance due as of December 31, 2022
is open through November 30, 2024. As of February 14, 2023, there was $4,492,192  available under the lines-of-credit we currently
have with related parties and $3,000,000 available under the 8% convertible debenture agreement.

reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management,
including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officer
has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report were not effective due to the lack of design and operating effectiveness of our control environment and risk assessment, control activities
and monitoring activities relating to complex accounting matters relating to the valuation of equity-based compensation instruments as
disclosed in Item 9A of our 10K filed on June 29, 2022.
Our principal executive and principal financial officer is in the process of performing a review of our processes and controls over complex
accounting matters relating to the valuation of equity-based compensation instruments.
Changes
in Internal Control
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
third quarter of 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
