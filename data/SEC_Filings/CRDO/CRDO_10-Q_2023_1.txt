1.
Description of Business and Basis of Presentation Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd was formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands in September 2014. Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd directly owns Credo Technology Group Ltd., which owns, directly and indirectly, all of the shares of its subsidiaries in mainland China, Hong Kong, and the United States (“U.S.”).
References to the “Company” in these notes refer to Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless otherwise specified. The Company is an innovator in providing secure, high-speed connectivity solutions that deliver improved power and cost efficiency. The Company’s connectivity solutions are optimized for optical and electrical Ethernet applications, including the emerging 100G, 200G, 400G and 800G markets. The Company’s products are based on its Serializer/Deserializer (“SerDes”) and Digital Signal Processor (“DSP”) technologies. The Company’s product families include integrated circuits (“ICs”), Active Electrical Cables (“AECs”) and SerDes Chiplets. The Company’s intellectual property (“IP”) solutions consist primarily of SerDes IP licensing. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted as permitted by the SEC. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s fiscal year 2022 audited financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments, that are considered necessary for fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and results of operations. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Operating results for the periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.
Effective May 1, 2022, the Company changed its fiscal year to a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to April 30. Our fiscal year ending April 29, 2023 (“fiscal year 2023”) is a 52-week fiscal year. The first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 ended on July 30, 2022, the second quarter ended on October 29, 2022 and the third quarter ended on January 28, 2023. 2.
Significant Accounting Policies The Company believes that other than the adoption of new accounting pronouncements and the accounting policies as described below, there have been no significant changes during the three and nine months ended January 28, 2023 to the items disclosed in Note 2, “Significant Accounting Policies,” included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. Use of Estimates The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future, given the available information. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, write-down for excess and obsolete inventories, the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation included in customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, variable consideration from revenue contracts, determination of the fair value of share-based awards, ordinary shares and a customer warrant, realization of tax assets and estimates of tax reserves, and incremental borrowing rate used in the Company’s operating lease calculations. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements. In the current macroeconomic environment affected by COVID-19, these estimates require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, these estimates may change materially in future periods. Reclassifications 10 Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Certain prior period balances were reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. None of these reclassifications had an impact on reported net income or cash flows for any of the periods presented. Revenue Recognition The Company’s revenues consist of sale of its products, licensing of its IP and providing product and IP license engineering services. Product sales consists of shipment of its ICs and AEC products. IP license revenue includes fees from licensing of the Company’s SerDes IP and related support and royalties. Product and IP license engineering services revenue consists of engineering fees associated with integration of the Company’s technology solutions into its customers’ products and IP, respectively. The Company’s customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers who design and manufacture end market devices for the communications and enterprise networks markets. The Company’s revenue is driven by various trends in these markets. The Company’s revenue is also impacted by changes in the number and average selling prices of its IC products.
The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods and services in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services. Where an arrangement includes multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to these on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. The Company determines the SSP based on an observable standalone selling price when it is available, as well as other factors, including the price charged to customers and the Company’s overall pricing objectives, while maximizing observable inputs. The determination of the SPP for certain of our IPs requires fair value estimate under income approach, involving the estimation of future cash flow expected to be generated from the IPs. The Company’s policy is to record revenue net of any applicable sales, use or excise taxes. Changes in the Company’s contract assets and contract liabilities primarily result from the timing difference between the Company’s performance and the customer’s payment. The Company fulfills its obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring products or services in exchange for consideration from the customer. The Company recognizes a contract asset when it transfers products or services to a customer and the right to consideration is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Accounts receivable are recorded when the customer has been billed or the right to consideration is unconditional. The Company recognizes deferred revenue when it has received consideration or an amount of consideration is due from the customer and it has a future obligation to transfer products or services.
Product Sales
- The Company transacts with customers primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products and generally allows customers to cancel or change purchase orders within limited notice periods prior to the scheduled shipment date. The Company offers standard performance warranties of twelve months after product delivery and offers limited product return rights to certain distributors. The Company recognizes product sales when it transfers control of promised goods in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods, net of accruals for estimated sales returns and rebates.
IP License Revenue -
The Company’s IP license revenue consists of perpetual licenses, support and maintenance, and royalties. The Company enters into perpetual semiconductor IP license agreements, that have a fixed fee, whereby licensees pay a fixed fee for the right to incorporate the Company’s IP technologies into the licensee’s products. The IP license agreements do not typically grant the customer the right to terminate for convenience. Where such rights exist, termination is prospective, with no refund of fees already paid by the customer. IP revenue recognition is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement. The Company recognizes license revenue at the point of time of the delivery of the IP. In connection with the license arrangements, the Company offers support to assist customers in qualifying their final product. Revenue from customer support is deferred and recognized ratably over the support period, which is typically one year.
In certain cases, the Company also charges licensees royalties related to the distribution or sale of products that use its technologies. Such royalties are reported to us on a quarterly basis. The Company estimates the sales-based royalties earned each quarter primarily based on its customers’ reporting of sales activity incurred in that quarter. The Company recognizes the estimated royalty revenue when it is probable that reversal of such amounts will not occur. Any differences between actual royalties owed by a customer and the quarterly estimates are recognized when updated information becomes available. Product and IP License Engineering Services Revenue -
Some product and IP revenue contracts include non-recurring engineering services deliverables. The Company recognizes revenue from these agreements over time as services are provided or at point in time upon completion and acceptance by the customer of contract deliverables, depending on the terms of the arrangement. Revenue is deferred for any amounts billed or received prior to delivery of
11 Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements services. The Company believes the input method, based on time spent by its engineers, best depicts the efforts expended to transfer services to the customers.
Certain contracts may include multiple performance obligations for which the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on relative SSP. The Company determines SSPs based on observable evidence. When SSPs are not directly observable, the Company uses the adjusted market assessment approach or residual approach, if applicable. The Company also considers the constraint on estimates of variable consideration when estimating the total transaction price. The Company records liabilities for amounts that are collected in advance of the satisfaction of performance obligations under deferred revenue.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments
Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash balances in the Company’s bank checking and savings accounts, and government and institutional money market funds. Investments not considered cash equivalents and with maturities of one year or less from the consolidated balance sheet date are classified as short-term investments. Short-term investments consist of a certificate of deposit with original maturity date between three and twelve months. The classification of our investments in marketable debt securities is determined at the time of purchase, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date. Marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. These investments are considered impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. We consult with our investment managers and consider available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments on a quarterly basis. If the cost of an individual investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. Accounting Pronouncement Recently Adopted In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2019-12,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating some exceptions to the general approach in Topic 740 in order to reduce cost and complexity of its application. This new guidance is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning May 1, 2022.
The Company adopted this guidance on May 1, 2022 prospectively, and the impact on its consolidated financial statements was not material. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which requires a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, with further clarifications made more recently. For trade receivables, loans and other financial instruments, the Company will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are probable. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities are required to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. This guidance is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning April 30, 2023 and interim periods within its fiscal year beginning April 28, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 3.
Concentrations Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and accounts receivable. Cash is placed in major financial institutions around the world. The Company’s cash deposits exceed insured limits. Short-term investments are subject to counterparty risk up to the amount presented on the balance sheet. Historically, a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of the Company’s revenue. The particular customers which account for revenue concentration have varied from period-to-period as a result of the addition of new contracts, completion of existing contracts, and the volumes and prices at which the
12 Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements customers have recently bought the Company’s products. These variations are expected to continue in the foreseeable future. The following table summarizes the significant customers’ accounts receivable and revenue as a percentage of total accounts receivable and total revenue, respectively: Accounts Receivable January 28, 2023 April 30, 2022 Customer A 69   % * Customer B 12   % * Customer C * 52   % Customer D * 14   % Three months ended Nine months ended Revenue January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 Customer A 52   % * 46   % * Customer C * 40   % * 33   % Customer D * 22   % 11   % 18   % Customer E 20   % * 14   % * Customer F * * * 13   % * Less than 10% of total accounts receivable or total revenue. 4.
Revenue Recognition The following table summarizes revenue disaggregated by primary geographical market based on destination of shipment and location of contracting entity, which may differ from the customer’s principal offices (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 Mainland China $ 29,233   $ 14,729   $ 83,412   $ 24,065   United States 16,513   5,924   35,001   18,999   Hong Kong 1,583   3,277   8,636   6,257   Singapore —   2,380   4,150   7,342   Rest of World 6,941   5,490   20,907   12,288   $ 54,270   $ 31,800   $ 152,106   $ 68,951   Contract Balances The contract assets are primarily related to the Company’s fixed fee IP licensing arrangements and rights to consideration for performance obligations delivered but not billed as of January 28, 2023 and April 30, 2022. During the three months ended January 28, 2023, the Company recognized $ 1.1
million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of October 29, 2022. During the three months ended January 31, 2022, the Company recognized $ 0.3
million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of October 31, 2021. During the nine months ended January 28, 2023, the Company recognized $ 1.1
million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of April 30, 2022. During the nine months ended January 31, 2022, the Company recognized $ 4.0
million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of April 30, 2021. During the nine months ended January 28, 2023, the increase in contract assets of $ 9.2
million was primarily driven by an IP licensing and engineering services arrangement where certain billing milestones had not yet been reached, but the criteria for revenue had been met. During the nine months ended January 28, 2023, the increase in deferred revenue of $ 2.3
million was primarily driven by a product engineering services arrangement where certain billing milestones had been reached prior to the timing of revenue recognition. 13 Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Remaining Performance Obligations Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. The contracted but unsatisfied performance obligation was approximately $ 11.7  million and the satisfied but unrecognized performance obligations was approximately $ 10.1  million as of January 28, 2023, which the Company expects to recognize over the next year. The amounts stated above include amounts relating to an IP licensing and development contract we entered into with a customer in September 2021, for total cash consideration of $ 43.5  million, which is receivable over an estimated period of
three years
upon meeting certain contractual milestones. As of January 28, 2023, we had billed $ 22.2  million and recognized revenue amounting to $ 32.7  million upon delivery of certain milestones of the contract. We have applied constraints on a remaining milestone due to significant uncertainty relating to the delivery of the milestone as of January 28, 2023 associated with dependency on actions by the customer. The constraints will be re-evaluated at each future reporting period. Customer Warrant
On December 28, 2021, the Company issued a warrant to Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC (“Holder”) to purchase an aggregate of up to
4,080,000
of our ordinary shares at an exercise price of $ 10.74
per share (the “Warrant”). The exercise period of the Warrant is through the seventh anniversary of the issue date. Upon issuance of the Warrant,
40,000
of the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant vested immediately and the remainder of the shares issuable will vest in tranches over the contract term based on the amount of global payments by Holder and its affiliates to us, up to $ 201  million in aggregate payments. A total of
80,000
Warrant shares were vested as of January 28, 2023. The grant date fair value of the Warrant share was determined at $ 4.65
per share using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The grant date fair value of the Warrant share was estimated using the following assumptions: At Grant Date Expected volatility 40.00 % Weighted-average expected term (in years) 7.00 Risk-free interest rate 1.41 % Dividend yield — % Fair value per ordinary share $ 10.74 During the three and nine months ended January 28, 2023, the Company recognized $ 0.3  million and $ 0.9  million, respectively, as contra revenue within the product sales revenue on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 - Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The Company measures the fair value of money market funds using Level 1 inputs. The Company’s certificates of deposit are classified as a held-to-maturity security as the Company intends to hold until their maturity dates. The certificates of deposit are valued using Level 2 inputs.
Pricing sources
may
include industry standard data providers,
14 Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements security master files from large financial institutions, and other
third -party sources used to determine a daily market value. The following table present the fair value of the financial instruments measured on a recurring basis as of January 28, 2023 (in thousands). January 28, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Cash equivalents: Money market funds $ 112,338   $ —   $ —   $ 112,338   Short-term investments: Certificate of deposit —   109,228   —   109,228   Total cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 112,338   $ 109,228   $ —   $ 221,566   The carrying amount of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate their respective fair values because of their short maturities. As of January 28, 2023, there were no unrealized loss or gains associated with the Company’s financial instruments.

In addition, the Company committed to certain purchase levels that were in line with the capacity reserved. If the Company does not meet the purchase level commitment, the agreement requires the Company to pay a fee equal to the difference between the actual purchase and the purchase commitment, up to the value of refundable deposits made. The Company currently estimates that it has made purchase level commitments of at least $ 35.5  million for the fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2028
16 Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under the capacity reservation agreement.

Convertible Preferred Shares The Company had previously issued Series A convertible preferred shares, Series B convertible preferred shares, Series C convertible preferred shares, Series D convertible preferred shares and Series D+ convertible preferred shares (collectively, the “Preferred Shares”). Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO during the quarter ended January 31, 2022, all of the then outstanding

- Each Preferred Share was convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time, and without the payment of any additional consideration, into such number of fully paid ordinary shares as was determined by dividing the applicable original issue price for each such series of Preferred Shares by the applicable conversion price in effect at the time of the conversion. The conversion price per share for each series of Preferred Share shall initially
17 Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements be equal to the original issue price of such series, which means $ 1.00
per share for Series A, $ 2.10
per share for Series B, $ 4.29
per share for Series C, $ 4.99
per share for Series D and $ 5.81
per share for Series D+. The conversion price shall be subject to adjustment in order to adjust the number of ordinary shares into which the Preferred Shares are convertible.
Each share of each series of Preferred Shares automatically converted into the number of ordinary shares at the conversion rate at the time in effect upon the closing of a public offering of ordinary shares which results in at least $ 25.0  million of proceeds to the Company at a per share price not less than $ 9.99
or with the vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Preferred Shares, voting as a separate class, to convert their Preferred Shares at the then effective Conversion Price. Dividends
- The holders of Preferred Shares were entitled to receive noncumulative dividends when and if declared by the Company’s board of directors. The holders of Preferred Shares were entitled to receive dividends prior and in preference to any payment of any dividend on ordinary shares in an amount equal to
8 % of the original issue price per share of such Preferred Share. After payment of such dividends, any additional dividends shall be distributed among all holders of ordinary shares and Preferred Shares in proportion to the number of ordinary shares that would be held by each such holder if all Preferred Shares were converted to ordinary shares at the then effective conversion rate. No dividends had been declared by the board of directors from inception through the date of conversion into ordinary shares. Liquidation Rights
- In the event of any sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the exclusive license of all or substantially all of the Company’s intellectual property used in generating all or substantially all of the Company’s revenues, reorganization, consolidation, acquisition, merger, liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive in preference to the holders of ordinary shares, an amount per share equal to the liquidation preference, plus any declared but unpaid dividends.

Income Taxes The Company’s tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that arise during the period. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, the Company makes a cumulative adjustment in such period. The Company’s quarterly tax provision, and estimate of its annual effective tax rate, is subject to variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, changes in tax laws, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, and discrete items. Provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three and nine months ended January 28, 2023 and January 31, 2022 was as follows (in thousands except percentages): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 % Change January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 % Change Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ ( 3,179 ) $ ( 387 ) 721.4   % $ ( 2,615 ) $ 1,116   ( 334.3 ) % Effective tax rate 893   % 73   % 81   % ( 7 ) % Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended January 28, 2023 differs from the same periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in tax benefit of share-based compensation.
During the three and nine months ended January 28, 2023, there were no material changes to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and we do not expect any significant changes in the next 12 months.

Our connectivity solutions are optimized for optical and electrical Ethernet applications, including the emerging 100G, 200G, 400G and 800G port markets. Our products are based on our proprietary Serializer/Deserializer (SerDes) and Digital Signal Processor (DSP) technology. Our product families include integrated circuits (ICs), Active Electrical Cables (AECs) and SerDes Chiplets. Our IP solutions primarily are comprised of SerDes IP development and licensing.
Data generation has increased dramatically over the past ten years, creating new and complicated challenges in both circuit and system design. Our proprietary SerDes and DSP technologies enable us to disrupt competition in existing markets, lead the way into emerging markets and innovate to create new market opportunities. While many others in the data infrastructure industry struggle to meet customers’ increasing performance and energy efficiency requirements, we continue to innovate to deliver groundbreaking solutions. A recent example is the announcement of our HiWire Switch cable and open-source implementation with Microsoft that helps realize Microsoft’s vision for a network-managed dual-Top-of-Rack (ToR) architecture, overcoming complex and slow legacy enterprise approaches, simplifying deployment and improving connection reliability in the data center. The multi-billion dollar data infrastructure market that we serve is driven largely by hyperscale data centers (hyperscalers), high performance computing (HPC) and 5G infrastructure. The demands for increased bandwidth, improved power and cost efficiency and heightened security have simultaneously and dramatically expanded as work, education and entertainment have rapidly digitized across billions of end-point users.
Since our founding in 2008, we have achieved several significant milestones: • From 2008 to 2012, we developed our proprietary, low-power, mixed-signal SerDes architecture which could scale from 25Gbps/lane to 50Gbps/lane and ultimately to 100Gbps/lane. • In 2013, we began commercializing our core SerDes technology by providing connectivity solutions for the electrical and optical links in data centers. • In 2014, we signed our first product contract with Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) services as well as our first IP licensing contract. • In 2016, we commenced production shipments of our Line Card PHY products. • In 2017, we developed a 3.2Tbps chiplet for high bandwidth 12.8Tbps switches. This chiplet included 64 lanes of 50Gbps SerDes and was built in 28nm using Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology from TSMC.
• In 2018, we created AECs, a new category of data center system products, beginning with developing 400G DDC solutions up to seven meters in length. • In 2019, we developed new DSP SerDes architectures optimizing the performance and power trade-offs for 400G and 800G solutions targeting Line Card PHYs, Optical PAM4 DSPs and AECs. • In 2020, we demonstrated the industry’s first 40Gbs PAM3 SerDes in silicon. In addition, we engineered breakthrough Line Card PHYs and Optical PAM4 DSPs with leading performance and power for 50G/lane and 100G/lane solutions. 22 • In 2021, we launched new AEC solutions targeting ToR-to-NIC connections. Our solutions enabled dual-ToR server racks to seamlessly “switch” data traffic to the redundant ToR if a ToR port failed. We design, market and sell both product and IP solutions. We help define industry conventions and standards within the markets we target by collaborating with technology leaders and standards bodies. We contract with a variety of manufacturing partners to build our products based on our proprietary SerDes and DSP technologies. We develop standard solutions we can sell broadly to our end markets and also develop tailored solutions designed to address specific customer needs. Once developed, these tailored solutions can generally be broadly leveraged across our portfolio and we are able to sell the product or license the IP into the broader market.
During the three months ended January 28, 2023 and January 31, 2022, we generated $54.3 million and $31.8 million in total revenue, respectively. Product sales and product engineering services revenue comprised 77% and 84% of our total revenue in the three months ended January 28, 2023 and January 31, 2022, respectively, and IP license and IP license engineering services revenue represented 23% and 16% of our total revenue in the three months ended January 28, 2023 and January 31, 2022, respectively. During the three months ended January 28, 2023 and January 31, 2022, we generated $2.8 million in net income and $0.1 million in net loss, respectively. We derive the substantial majority of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and we anticipate we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers for the foreseeable future. We expect that as our products are more widely adopted and as our number of customers increase, customer concentration will decrease. Our Business Model We are a product-focused business with a strong foundation in IP, pioneering comprehensive connectivity solutions that deliver bandwidth, scalability and end-to-end signal integrity for next-generation platforms. We also develop IP solutions to address the specific and complex needs of our customers. We earn revenue from these IP solutions primarily through licensing fees and royalties. In addition to product sales and IP license revenue, we also generate revenue from providing engineering services as part of our product and license arrangements with certain customers.
Over time, we expect to generate an increased proportion of our revenue from sales of our products.
We expect to see a long-term benefit from improvements in our operating leverage as our business continues to gain scale. We utilize a fabless business model, working with a network of third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our connectivity products. This approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our core competencies and to control our fixed costs and capital expenditures.
We employ a two-pronged sales strategy targeting both the end users of our products, as well as the suppliers of our end users. By engaging directly with the end user, we are able to better understand the needs of our customers and cater our solutions to their most pressing connectivity requirements. This strategy has enabled us to become the preferred vendor to a number of our customers who, in turn, in some cases, require their suppliers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs) and optical module manufacturers to utilize our solutions. 23 Revenue Mix and Associated Gross Margins We are a product-focused business with a strong foundation in IP and, as such, our customers engage with us through the purchase of our products or the licensing of our IP. In some instances, customers will engage us to develop tailored products or IP licenses to meet their specific application requirements. We charge these customers incremental fees for this tailored development, which are in addition to product sales or IP license revenue, and we recognize these additional fees as product engineering or IP license engineering services revenue.
By providing tailored engineering services to our customers, we believe we strengthen our customer relationships, enable additional sales and establish ourselves for potential long-term revenue opportunities from associated product sales or IP license revenue. A summary of our revenue and associated gross margin by these revenue sources for the three and nine months ended January 28, 2023 and January 31, 2022, respectively, is presented below (in thousands, except percentages): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 Revenue: Product sales $ 38,033  $ 22,706  $ 117,645  $ 48,423  Product engineering services 3,635  3,954  8,209  6,628  Total product sales and product engineering services 41,668  26,660  125,854  55,051  IP license 11,715  5,022  24,179  12,194  IP license engineering services 887  118  2,073  1,706  Total IP license and IP license engineering services 12,602  5,140  26,252  13,900  Total revenue

24 Factors Affecting Our Performance Our results of operations and financial condition have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors including the following: Design Wins With New and Existing Customers Our solutions enable our end customers to differentiate their product offerings and position themselves to meet the demands of increasingly advanced networks. We work closely with our end customers to understand their product roadmaps and strategies and help them develop new products.
Our goal is to develop solutions that support their product roadmap and development. If an end customer has tested our product, verified that it meets their requirements and the customer has informed us that the end customer intends to have our customer build it into their product, we consider it a design win. We consider design wins important to our future success. The selection process is typically lengthy and may require us to incur significant design and development expenditures in pursuit of a design win with no assurance that our solutions will be selected.
In addition, some design wins result in significant revenue and some do not, and the timing of such revenue is difficult to predict as it depends on the success of the end customer’s product that uses our solutions. Thus, some design wins result in orders and significant revenue shortly after the design win is awarded and other design wins do not result in significant orders and revenue for several months or longer after the initial design win (if at all).
As a result, the degree to which we are successful in achieving design wins and the speed and level at which end customers ramp volume production of the products into which our product is designed will impact our success and financial results in future periods. Customer Demand and Pipeline Demand for our products is dependent on conditions in the markets in which our customers operate, which are subject to cyclicality and competitive conditions, among other factors. We believe our relationships with the end customers of our products and the long-term implications of decisions to adopt our solutions provide us with valuable visibility into customer demand. Furthermore, our customers generally provide us with periodic forecasts of their requirements. This provides an opportunity for us to monitor and refine our business operations and plans. The majority of our product sales are made pursuant to standard purchase orders. Changes in customer forecasts or the timing of orders from customers expose us to the risks of inventory shortages or excess inventory, as well as fluctuations in our results of operations. For example, on February 14, 2023, we announced that our largest customer has reduced its demand forecast for certain Credo products for reasons we understand are unrelated to our performance. Although we do not expect our market share with the customer will be affected, we expect that the customer’s reduced demand forecast will have a substantial negative impact on our revenue and results of operations for our fiscal fourth quarter ending April 29, 2023 and our fiscal year ending April 27, 2024. Cancellations of orders could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce and manage our operating expenses. Pricing and Product Gross Margins Our revenue is also impacted by changes in the number and average selling prices of our products. Our products are typically characterized by a life cycle that begins with higher average selling prices and lower volumes, followed by broader market adoption, leading to higher volumes, and average selling prices lower than initial levels. Our product gross margins will be affected by the extent to which these declines are paired with improvements in manufacturing yields and lower wafer, assembly and test costs that offset some of the margin reduction that results from lower average selling prices as well as the extent to which we introduce new products with higher initial average selling prices and achieve market acceptance. Our gross margins may also be affected by changes in the price of silicon wafers, copper cables, printed circuit boards (PCBs), testing costs and commodities, and the extent to which we are able to offset any increases in our costs through increases prices to our customers, productivity actions or other means. Our product gross margins may also fluctuate from period to period as a result of changes
25 in average selling prices due to new product introductions or existing product transitions into larger scale commercial volumes and manufacturing costs as well as our product and customer mix. Product Adoption We develop and sell leading-edge connectivity solutions for digital infrastructure which are intended to replace existing legacy solutions and support our customers’ future applications and needs. Our success is dependent on customers adopting our new technology and preferring our solutions over competing offerings or other current or future technologies. Technology Development We operate in industries characterized by rapidly changing technologies, industry standards and technological obsolescence. We work closely with our customers to understand their product roadmaps and strategies to forecast their future needs. This helps inform our technology roadmap and development priorities. We also monitor forecasts by industry analysts and the adoption curve of technology as well as potential competing forces which could hinder adoption of our solutions. Our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to continually develop and introduce new products to meet the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers, diversify our revenue base and generate new revenue to replace, or build upon, the success of previously introduced products which may be rapidly maturing. As a result, our revenue is impacted, to a more significant extent, by product life cycles for a variety of products and to a much lesser extent, if any, by any single product. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant expenses in research and development, and our research and development expenses in a particular period may be significantly impacted by specific product or engineering initiatives that we undertake to maintain our competitiveness and expand our product portfolio. If we fail to anticipate or respond appropriately to new developments in technology, or to timely develop competitive new or enhanced products or technologies, our revenue could decrease and we could lose design wins to our competitors. Industry Trends and Cyclicality We continue to evaluate trends within the industry that affect our business performance. We design and develop high-speed connectivity solutions that deliver improved power and cost efficiency for the data infrastructure market. This market is driven by hyperscalers, HPC and 5G infrastructure. Accordingly, our revenue and business performance are influenced by the deployment and timing of broader market adoption of next generation technologies in data centers, particularly by hyperscalers, and in the HPC and 5G markets. The semiconductor industry is cyclical and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving standards, product obsolescence, price erosion, and fluctuations in product supply and demand. Any prolonged or significant downturn in our industry generally could adversely affect our business and reduce demand for our products and otherwise harm our financial condition and results of operations. Macroeconomic Environment Our industry is subject to uncertainty as a result of the recent macroeconomic environment, which has been characterized by rising interest rates and inflation, geopolitical instability, continuing risk from the COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures related to it, and supply chain uncertainty. These factors are causing companies across the semiconductor industry to reduce spending and tighten inventory controls, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. COVID-19 We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. The extent and nature of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance will be influenced by a variety of factors, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, as well as future spikes of COVID-19
26 infections or the emergence of additional COVID-19 variants that may result in additional preventative and mitigative measures. These factors may affect the timing and magnitude of demand from customers and the availability of portions of the supply chain, logistical services and component supply and may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results. For additional information regarding the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see “ Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and will likely continue to disrupt normal business activity and may adversely impact our operations and financial results. ” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. 27 Results of Operations Three and Nine Months Ended January 28, 2023 and January 31, 2022 The following table sets forth information derived from our unaudited consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenue: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 Revenue: Product sales 70.1  % 71.4  % 77.3  % 70.2  % Product engineering services 6.7  % 12.4  % 5.4  % 9.7  % IP license 21.6  % 15.8  % 15.9  % 17.7  % IP license engineering services 1.6  % 0.4  % 1.4  % 2.5  % Total revenue 100.0  % 100.0  % 100.0  % 100.0  % Cost of revenue: Cost of product sales revenue 40.3  % 38.4  % 40.7  % 38.3  % Cost of product engineering services revenue 0.4  % 1.3  % 0.5  % 2.6  % Cost of IP license revenue —  % —  % 0.8  % —  % Cost of IP license engineering services revenue 0.4  % 0.2  % 0.4  % 0.7  % Total cost of revenue 41.1  % 39.9  % 42.4  % 41.6  % Gross margin 58.9  % 60.1  % 57.6  % 58.4  % Operating expenses: Research and development 37.8  % 34.6  % 36.4  % 47.2  % Selling, general and administrative 22.0  % 26.9  % 22.8  % 33.9  % Impairment charges 4.4  % —  % 1.6  % —  % Total operating expenses 64.2  % 61.5  % 60.8  % 81.1  % Operating loss (5.3) % (1.4) % (3.2) % (22.7) % Other income (expense), net 4.6  % (0.3) % 1.1  % (0.1) % Loss before income taxes (0.7) % (1.7) % (2.1) % (22.8) % Provision (benefit) for income taxes (5.9) % (1.2) % (1.7) % 1.6  % Net income (loss) 5.2  % (0.5) % (0.4) % (24.4) % Comparison of Three and Nine Months Ended January 28, 2023 and January 31, 2022 Revenue Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 % Change January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 % Change (in thousands, except percentages) Product sales $ 38,033  $ 22,706  67.5  % $ 117,645  $ 48,423  143.0  % Product engineering services 3,635  3,954  (8.1) % 8,209  6,628  23.9  % IP license 11,715  5,022  133.3  % 24,179  12,194  98.3  % IP license engineering services 887  118  651.7  % 2,073  1,706  21.5  % Total revenue $ 54,270  $ 31,800  70.7  % $ 152,106  $ 68,951  120.6  % Total revenue for the three months ended January 28, 2023 increased by $22.5 million, compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, primarily due to an increase in product sales revenue of $15.3 million and an increase in IP license revenue of $6.7 million. Total revenue for the nine months ended January 28, 2023 increased by $83.2 million, compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, primarily due to increases in product sales revenue of $69.2 million and IP license revenue of $12.0 million. 28 The increase in product sales for the three and nine months ended January 28, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of unit shipments of AEC cables, which contributed more than 90% of the increase in product sales revenue, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2022. The AEC sales increase was primarily driven by the fact that we introduced the AEC product category in fiscal 2021 and we began ramping our AEC solutions at our first hyperscale data center customer this year.
The increase in IP license revenue for the three and nine months ended January 28, 2023 was driven by high-dollar IP licenses delivered to a customer that resulted in revenue recognition of $10.1 million during the three months ended January 28, 2023 and $19.1 million during the nine months ended January 28, 2023. Cost of Revenue Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 % Change January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 % Change (in thousands, except percentages) Cost of product sales revenue $ 21,833  $ 12,230  78.5  % $ 62,016  $ 26,436  134.6  % Cost of product engineering services revenue 228  410  (44.4) % 746  1,807  (58.7) % Cost of IP license revenue —  —  N/A 1,179  —  N/A Cost of IP license engineering services revenue 222  48  362.5  % 556  462  20.3  % Total cost of revenue $ 22,283  $ 12,688  75.6  % $ 64,497  $ 28,705  124.7  % Cost of product sales revenue increased by $9.6 million in the three months ended January 28, 2023 and $35.6 million in the nine months ended January 28, 2023, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2022, primarily due to increased product sales during the same period as discussed above.
Cost of IP license revenue in the nine months ended January 28, 2023 related to costs incurred for delivery of a milestone during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 on an IP licensing and development contract entered into with a customer in September 2021 (refer to note 4 of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for details). Gross Profit and Gross Margin Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 % Change January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 % Change (in thousands, except percentages) Gross profit $ 31,987  $ 19,112  67.4  % $ 87,609  $ 40,246  117.7  % Gross margin 58.9  % 60.1  % 57.6  % 58.4  % Gross margin decreased by 1 percentage point in the three months ended January 28, 2023, compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by a $1.4 million increase of write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory. This was partially offset by the revenue mix shift between IP license revenue and product sales revenue between the periods.
Gross margin for the nine months ended January 28, 2023 stayed relatively flat compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. Research and Development Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 % Change January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 % Change (in thousands, except percentages) Research and development $ 20,530  $ 10,995  86.7  % $ 55,371  $ 32,488  70.4  % % of total revenue 37.8  % 34.6  % 36.4  % 47.2  % 29 Research and development expense for the three months ended January 28, 2023 increased by $9.5 million compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. The increase was due primarily to a $1.8 million increase in personnel costs as a result of new hires for product development, a $2.3 million increase in share-based compensation expense driven by increased amortization expense from new equity awards granted to employees, a $3.2 million increase in design activities and higher engineering activities relating to testing and laboratory supplies for new product development, a $1.1 million increase in depreciation expense driven by increased computer equipment and software, and laboratory equipment utilized in R&D activities, and a $0.5 million increase in IT and facilities costs. Research and development expense for the nine months ended January 28, 2023 increased by $22.9 million compared to the same period in fiscal 2022.

The fluctuation was primarily due to an increase in tax benefit of share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our activities consist primarily of selling our products, licensing our IP, providing IP customization services and conducting research and development of our products and technology. Since our inception through January 28, 2023, our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds from our initial public offering, the sale of convertible preferred shares and ordinary shares prior to our initial public offering, and cash generated from our customers. As of January 28, 2023 and April 30, 2022, we had $123.8 million and $259.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively, and working capital of $306.6 million and $305.7 million, respectively. Our principal use of cash is to fund our operations and invest in research and development to support our growth. See also Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further discussion of our cash requirements under non-cancelable purchase obligations. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and other components of working capital will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and research and development expenditures and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. In the event that we need to borrow funds or issue additional equity, we cannot assure you that any such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when we need it, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated. Nine Months Ended January 28, 2023 January 31, 2022 (in thousands) Net cash used in operating activities $ (12,776) $ (33,192) Net cash used in investing activities $ (127,043) $ (7,932) Net cash provided by financing activities $ 4,287  $ 178,014  Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $12.8 million for the nine months ended January 28, 2023. The cash outflows from operating activities for the nine months ended January 28, 2023 were primarily due to $40.7 million of cash outflows for working capital purposes, partially offset by $28.5 million of non-cash items. The cash outflows from working capital for the nine months ended January 28, 2023 were primarily driven by (a) an increase in accounts receivable of $13.6 million primarily due to increased sales in the fiscal quarter ended January 28, 2023 compared to the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2022, and timing of collection; (b) an increase in inventory of $26.1 million to support unfulfilled backlog and related new product ramps; (c) an increase in contract assets of $9.2 million primarily driven by an IP licensing and engineering services arrangement where certain billing milestones had not yet been reached, but the criteria for revenue had been met; and (d) an increase in other non-current assets of $5.6 million primarily due to refundable deposit payments for manufacturing commitments and an increase in deferred tax assets position. These cash outflows were offset by cash inflow relating to increase in accounts payable of $11.7 million due to amounts payable relating to increased purchases of inventory.
Net cash used in operating activities was $33.2 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2022. The cash outflows from operating activities for the nine months ended January 31, 2022 were primarily due to $16.8 million of net loss and $25.1 million of cash outflows for working capital purposes, partially offset by $8.7 million of non-cash
31 items. The cash outflows from working capital for the nine months ended January 31, 2022 were primarily driven by (a) an increase in accounts receivable of $8.0 million due to increased sales in the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2021, and timing of collection; (b) an increase in inventory of $20.3 million to better support unfulfilled backlog and related new product ramps; (c) and an increase in contract assets of $5.2 million primarily driven by certain IP licensing and engineering services arrangements
where certain billing milestones had not yet been reached, but the criteria for revenue had been met. This was offset by increases in accounts payable of $3.2 million and accrued expenses, compensation and other liabilities of $5.9 million due to amounts payable relating to increased purchases of inventory to support growing demand for our products.
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $127.0 million in the nine months ended January 28, 2023 was attributable to purchases of property and equipment of $17.8 million and investment in certificates of deposit of $109.2 million. Purchases of property and equipment primarily related to mask sets purchases for new products introduced or in process of being introduced, and computer equipment and software used for research and development purposes. Net cash used in investing activities of $7.9 million in the nine months ended January 31, 2022 was attributable to purchases of property and equipment, including third-party licenses.

Net cash provided by financing activities of $178.0 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to $168.8 million in proceeds from IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering costs, $1.9 million in proceeds from exercises of employee share options and $7.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred shares, net of issuance costs.
Critical Accounting Estimates There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates during the three and nine
months ended January 28, 2023, as compared to those disclosed under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. In the current macroeconomic environment affected by COVID-19, our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. We continue to monitor and assess our estimates in light of developments, and as events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates may change materially in future periods. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For more information, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. JOBS Act Accounting Election We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an “emerging growth company” to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an “emerging growth company” or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. For a discussion of market risks, refer to Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022. During the three and nine months ended January 28, 2023, there were no material changes or developments that would materially alter the market risk assessment performed as of April 30, 2022, other than the updated disclosure regarding interest rate risk below.
32 Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment policy that requires minimum credit ratings and diversification of credit risk. We invest our excess cash primarily in money market mutual funds and time deposits. These investments are recorded on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair market value with their related unrealized gain or loss reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity (deficit). Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There was no change in our “internal control over financial reporting,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the quarter ended January 28, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Credo have been detected. 33 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any litigation the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on us. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our stock. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other than as described below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022.
Our share price has been and may continue to be volatile and may decline, resulting in a loss of some or all of your investment. Our share price has been and may continue to be volatile and may decline, resulting in a loss of some or all of your investment. Investors in our ordinary shares may not be able to resell those shares at or above the price at which they purchase such shares, or at all. The trading price and volume of our ordinary shares has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. From January 27, 2022 (the first day of trading of our ordinary shares on Nasdaq) through the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the trading price of our ordinary shares on Nasdaq has ranged from a high of $[18.00] to a low of $[8.61] per share, and in the future could fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to: • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations due to, among other things, changes in customer demand, product life cycles, pricing, ordering patterns, and unforeseen operating costs; • the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections, including due to the foregoing business considerations; • failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow us, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; • announcements by our significant customers of changes to their product offerings, business plans, or strategies; • announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; • changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in the data infrastructure industry; • timing and seasonality of the end-market demand; • cyclical fluctuations in the data infrastructure market; • price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole; • actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally; • new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws, or regulations applicable to our business; • changes in general global economic conditions, including as a result of the reduced growth in the U.S. economy during the first two quarters of 2022, combined with the expected decline in the rate of economic
34 growth in Europe, China, and globally in 2022 and into 2023, which can have a negative effect on demand for our products; • the impacts of rising inflation, which can have an impact on the cost of our components and/or decrease demand for our products, and changes in prevailing interest rates; • the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including the impacts of our substantial presence in, and reliance upon suppliers based in, China, which has implemented more extreme control measures in response to the pandemic, including a “Zero-COVID” policy that continues to implement lockdowns in response to outbreaks, such as the recent lockdown in Kunshan, China in spring 2022, which impacted certain of our key suppliers on which we depend for our AECs; • our ability to successfully implement our plans to mitigate the impact of potential future supply chain issues by adding geographic diversity to our supply chain and holding increased levels of
AEC inventory, which could be ineffective or insufficient or result in inventory write-downs; • geopolitical issues, including developments in the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan or Hong Kong, including the escalation of tensions between the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan, such as recent step up of military exercises around Taiwan by the PRC, all of which could interrupt our supply chain, our operations or our ability to conduct our business; • changes in our management; • lawsuits threatened or filed against us; and • other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events. In addition, the market for technology stocks and the stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We will be required to provide management’s attestation on internal controls. The standards required for a public company under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are significantly more stringent than those required of us as a privately-held company. We may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements. If we are not able to implement the additional requirements of Section 404(a) in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may not be able to assess whether our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which may subject us to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence and the market price of our securities. 35 Item 6.
