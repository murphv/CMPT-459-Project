NOTES
TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December
31, 2022
NOTE
1 –
ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS
Metavesco,
Inc. (formerly Waterside Capital Corporation) (the “Company”) was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia on July 13,
1993 and was a closed-end investment company licensed by the Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) as a Small Business
Investment Company (“SBIC”). The Company previously made equity investments in, and provided loans to, small businesses to
finance their growth, expansion, and development. Under applicable SBA regulations, the Company was restricted to investing only in qualified
small businesses as contemplated by the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. As a registered investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), the Company’s investment objective was to provide its
shareholders with a high level of income, with capital appreciation as a secondary objective. The Company made its first investment in
a small business in October 1996.
On
May 28, 2014, with the Company’s consent, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, having jurisdiction
over an action filed by the SBA (the “Court”), entered a Consent Order and Judgment Dismissing Counterclaim, Appointing Receiver,
Granting Permanent Injunctive Relief and Granting Money Judgment (the “Order”). The Order appointed the SBA receiver of the
Company for the purpose of marshaling and liquidating in an orderly manner all of the Company’s assets and entered judgment in
favor of the United States of America, on behalf of the SBA, against the Company in the amount of $ 11,770,722 .
The Court assumed jurisdiction over the Company and the SBA was appointed receiver effective May 28, 2014.
The
Company effectively stopped conducting an active business upon the appointment of the SBA as the receiver and the commencement of the
court-ordered receivership (the “Receivership”). Over the course of the Receivership, the activity of the Company was limited
to the liquidation of the Company’s assets by the receiver and the payment of the proceeds therefrom to the SBA and for the expenses
of the Receivership. On June 28, 2017, the Receivership was terminated with the entry of a Final Order by the Court. The Final Order
specifically stated that “Control of Waterside shall be unconditionally transferred and returned to its shareholders c/o Roran
Capital, LLC (“Roran”) upon notification of entry of this Order”. Upon termination of the Receivership, Roran took
possession of all books and records made available to it by the SBA.
The
Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) an application pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Investment Company Act for an order declaring that
the Company had ceased to be a registered investment company. On April 22, 2020, the SEC issued an order under Section 8(f) of the Investment
Company Act declaring that the Company had ceased to be an investment company. As a result, the Company is now a
reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
On
September 2, 2021, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) by and between (i) the Company (ii) Ryan
Schadel (“Buyer”) and (iii) Roran. Roran agreed to sell to the Buyer
4,247,666
shares of common stock of the Company held
by Roran for a total purchase price of $ 385,000 . In conjunction with the SPA, Roran agreed to forgive all amounts due to Roran by the
Company totaling $ 207,644 , which is comprised of convertible note payable – related party, accrued interest payable – related
party, and advances from related party.
The Buyer acquired
4,247,666
shares of the Company’s
Common Stock, representing
69.7 % of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. As such, the SPA resulted in a change of control
of the Company.
Effective
November 29, 2021, the Company converted from a Virginia corporation to a Nevada corporation.
On
December 15, 2021, the Company filed with the Nevada Secretary of State amended and restated articles of incorporation. The amended
and restated articles
of incorporation
had the effect of (i) increasing the
Company’s authorized common stock to
100
million shares, (ii) increasing the Company’s authorized preferred stock to
20
million shares, and (iii) reducing the par value of each of the Company’s common stock and preferred stock to $ 0.0001
per share.
Common stock and additional paid-in
capital for all periods presented in these unaudited financial statements have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the reduction
in par value.
On
December 17, 2021, the majority shareholder and board of directors approved an amendment to the amended and restated articles of incorporation
that would change the Company’s name from Waterside Capital Corporation to Metavesco, Inc. The name change was effective June 3, 2022 , following clearance by the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) .
In
March 2022, the Company commenced operations as a web3 enterprise. The Company generates income as a liquidity provider, via decentralized
exchanges such as Uniswap. Additionally, the Company farms tokens via Proof of Stake protocols on decentralized exchanges ,
as well as
centralized exchanges including
the
Coinbase , Inc. (“Coinbase”)
exchange. The Company also invests in
what it considers
promising
non-fungible token (“ NFT ”)
projects and virtual land, primarily on
Ethereum virtual machine (“ EVM ”)
protocols.
The
interim unaudited financial statements herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The accompanying interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared under
the presumption that users of the interim financial information have either read or have access to the audited financial statements for
the latest fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Accordingly, note disclosures which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained
on June 30, 2022, audited financial statements have been omitted from these interim unaudited financial statements. The Company evaluated
all subsequent events and transactions through the date of filing this report.
7
Certain
information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with the United States generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2023. For further
information, refer to the audited financial statements and notes for the year ended June 30, 2022, included in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 7, 2022.
Going
Concern
The
Company’s unaudited financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP applicable to a going concern. This contemplates
the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the six months ended December
31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $ 165,326
and used cash in operating activities of $ 123,715 ,
and on December 31, 2022, had an accumulated deficit of $ 19,211,528 .
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period
one year from the date that the unaudited financial statements are issued. The Company will be dependent upon the raising of
additional capital through placement of debt and its common stock in order to implement its business plan. There can be no assurance
that the Company will be successful in this situation. The Company expects over the next twelve months, cash held at a financial
institution will be expended on professional fees, transfer agent, Edgar agent and other administrative costs. The cash held at
Coinbase will be deployed to purchase crypto assets to generate staking rewards and liquidity pool fees. We hope to start
paying some of our suppliers and contractors in crypto assets in the coming months. However, there can be no assurance we will be
able to pay any of our suppliers and contractors in digital assets.
NOTE

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Significant
Accounting Policies
There
have been no material changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies to those previously disclosed in the Company’s
audited financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC.
Fiscal
Year-End
The
Company elected June 30 as its fiscal year-end date.
Use
of Estimates and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
These
significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these
estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.
Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial
statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Management
regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes
in facts and circumstances, historical experience, and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates
are adjusted accordingly.
Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Cash
and cash equivalents
Cash
and cash equivalents include cash and interest-bearing highly liquid investments held at financial institutions, cash on hand that is
not restricted as to withdrawal or use with an initial maturity of three months or less, and cash held in accounts at crypto trading
venues. At December 31, 2022, $ 972
of cash was at held a financial institution which is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(“FDIC”) and $ 0
was held at Coinbase. The contract with Coinbase requires USD balances
in a client’s fiat wallet be held in an omnibus custodial account for the benefit of Coinbase’s customers. These accounts
are either omnibus bank accounts insured by the FDIC (currently up to $ 250,000
per entity) or trust accounts holding short term U.S.
treasuries.
Intangible
Assets
Digital
assets held by the Company are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, and are initially measured at cost. The
Company assigns costs to transactions on a first-in, first-out basis (FIFO).
An
intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events
or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment
exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the digital assets at the time its
fair value is being measured.
Tokens
are subject to impairment losses if the fair value a tokens decreases below the carrying value at any time during the period. The fair
value is measured using the quoted price in the principal market of the tokens. The Company currently obtains the quoted price of tokens
from
www.cryptocompare.com .
Liquidity
pool tokens and non-fungible tokens are subject to impairment losses if the fair value a token decreases below the carrying value at
the end of each quarterly accounting period. The fair value of liquidity pool tokens is based on the quoted price on the last day of
the quarter at 4PM Eastern Time. The fair value of NFTs is based on the average trading price on the last day of each quarter.
8
Impairment
for liquidity pool tokens and NFTs is assessed quarterly due to each token being a unique asset and due to the illiquid
markets in which these tokens trade. The Company is continuously reviewing available markets and information and its methodology when
determining the fair value of digital assets.
The
Company currently reviews quoted prices of its liquidity pool tokens, NFTs and comparable tokens at
https://uniswap.org /
and
https://opensea.io . Impairment expense is reflected in total expense in the statements of operations. Subsequent reversal
of impairment losses is not permitted.
The
sales of digital assets held are included within investing activities in the accompanying statements of cash flows and any realized gains
or losses from such sales are included in other income (expense) in the statements of operations.
Revenue
recognition
The
Company recognizes revenue under the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) 606 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The core principle of the revenue standard is
that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are
applied to achieve that core principle:
●
Step
1: Identify the contract with the customer
●
Step
2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract
●
Step
3: Determine the transaction price
●
Step
4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
●
Step
5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation
Revenue
is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration
the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company generates revenue through liquidity pools
and staking rewards.
Liquidity
Pools
Liquidity
pools are a collection of digital assets locked in a smart contract that provide liquidity to decentralized exchanges. Liquidity allows
digital assets to be converted to cash quickly and efficiently without drastic price swings. An important component of a liquidity pool
are automated market makers (“AMMs”). An AMM is a protocol that uses liquidity pools to allow digital assets to be traded by a mathematical
formula rather than though a traditional market of buyers and sellers.
The
Company earns fees by providing liquidity on Uniswap V2 and Uniswap V3. The Company earns fees proportionate to the liquidity they have
supplied to the exchange. The fee for each trade is set at 0.05% for stable coins, 0.3% for most pairs and 1.0% for exotic pairs. The
fees earned by the Company depend on the risk characteristics of each pair of tokens selected and the price range liquidity is provided.
Uniswap V2 requires users to provide liquidity over the entire price curve, whereas Uniswap V3 provides users with liquidity over a price
range .
Revenue
is recognized from liquidity pools when the award is claimed and deposited in the Company wallet. The transaction consideration the Company
receives is noncash in the form of digital assets. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the digital asset awards received.
Staking
Rewards
Staking
rewards are granted to holders of a crypto asset when the holders lock up that crypto asset as collateral to secure fairness when validating
transactions or other network actions.
The
Company participates in networks with proof-of-stake consensus algorithms, through creating or validating blocks on the network. In exchange
for participating in the consensus mechanism of these networks, the Company earns rewards in the form of the native token of the network.
Each block creation or validation is a performance obligation. Revenue is recognized at the point when the block creation or validation
is complete and the rewards are transferred into a digital wallet that the Company controls. Revenue is measured based on the number
of tokens received and the fair value of the token at contract inception.
Airdrops
Airdrops
are the distribution of tokens without compensation generally undertaken with a view of increasing awareness of a new token, to encourage
adoption of a new token and to increase liquidity in the early stages of a token project.
The
Company recognizes crypto assets received through an airdrop if the crypto asset is expected to generate a probable future benefit and
if the Company is able to support the trading, custody, or withdrawal of these assets.
Airdrops
are accounted for in accordance with ASC 610-20 , Sales and Transfer of Nonfinancial Assets,
Receipt of a airdrops are classified
as gains on the statement of operations.
Convertible
Financial Instruments
The
Company bifurcates conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments
if certain criteria are met. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative
instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument
that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable
generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument
with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when
the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under applicable GAAP.
9
When
the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments, discounts are recorded
for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in the instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying
common stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the instrument.
Beneficial
conversion feature
– The issuance of the convertible debt generated a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”), which
arises when a debt or equity security is issued with a non-separated embedded conversion option that is beneficial to the investor or
in the money at inception because the conversion option has an effective strike price that is less than the market price of the underlying
stock at the commitment date. The Company recognized the BCF by allocating the intrinsic value of the conversion option, which is the
number of shares of common stock available upon conversion multiplied by the difference between the effective conversion price per share
and the fair value of common stock per share on the commitment date, resulting in a discount on the convertible debt (recorded as a component
of additional paid-in capital). The BCF is amortized into interest expense over the life of the related debt.
Related
Parties
The
Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the ASC for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.
The
financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense
allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. The disclosures shall include: (a) the nature of the relationship(s)
involved; (b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each
of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects
of the transactions on the financial statements; (c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements
are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and, (d)
amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner
of settlement.
Commitments
and Contingencies
The
Company follows ASC 450-20 to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements
are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to
occur. Management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing
loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings,
management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount
of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.
If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates
that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then
the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.
Loss
contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.
Deferred
Tax Assets and Income Taxes Provision
The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10-25-13, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to
be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC 740-10-25-13, the Company may recognize the tax
benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the
taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such
a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than
50%
likelihood of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. ASC 740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest, and penalties on income taxes,
accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized
income tax benefits.
The
estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying
balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred
tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.
Management
makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates
of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions.
In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction
varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.
Tax
years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions are generally the prior three years for federal purposes, and
the prior four years for state purposes; however, as a result of the Company’s operating losses, all tax years remain subject
to examination by tax authorities .
10
Net
Loss Per Common Share
The
Company computes net income or loss per share in accordance with ASC 260 Earnings Per Share. Under the provisions of ASC 260, basic net
loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock
equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of ASC for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted
paragraph 820-10-35-37 of ASC (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments.
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and
comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The three levels of fair
value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:
Level
1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level
2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable
as of the reporting date.
Level
3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar
techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.
The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than
one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of
the instrument.
Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arms-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market
dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions
were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.
Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In
August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt— Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and
Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40).
This update amends the guidance on convertible instruments
and the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity and improves and amends the related earnings per share guidance for
both Subtopics. This standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2023, which means it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024. Early adoption is permitted but no earlier than fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact
of ASU 2020-06 on our financial statements.
Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s
present or future financial statements.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Forward-Looking
Statements
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
in Item 2 of Part I of this report, include forward-looking statements. Information in this report contains “forward-looking statements”
which may be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as “may”, “shall”, “will”,
“could”, “expect”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “predict”, “probable”,
“possible”, “should”, “continue”, “believes”, “estimates”, “projects”,
“targets”, or similar terms, variations of those terms or the negative of those terms. Our management has compiled the forward-looking
statements specified in the following information based on assumptions made by management and considered by management to be reasonable.
Our future operating results, however, are impossible to predict and no representation, guaranty, or warranty is to be inferred from
those forward-looking statements. Statements in this report concerning the following, without limitation, are forward-looking statements:
●
future
financial and operating results;
●
our
ability to fund operations and business plans, and the timing of any funding or corporate development transactions we may pursue;
●
our
ability to either (i) enter into a new business; or (ii) merge with, or otherwise acquire, an active business which would benefit
from operating as a public entity;
●
current
and future economic and political conditions;
●
overall
industry and market trends;
●
management’s
goals and plans for future operations; and
●
other
assumptions described in this report underlying or relating to any forward-looking statements.
All
references to “Metavesco”, “we”, “our,” “us” and the “Company” in this Item
2 refer to Metavesco, Inc..
The
discussion in this section contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance.
We have attempted to identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “can,”
“continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,”
“potential,” “predict,” “should,” “would” or “will” or the negative of these
terms or other comparable terminology, but their absence does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These statements are
only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause our actual results to differ
from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify
all risks and uncertainties and you should not consider the risks and uncertainties identified by us to be a complete set of all potential
risks or uncertainties that could materially affect us. You should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements we make
herein because some or all of them may turn out to be wrong. We undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements
contained herein to reflect future events and developments, except as required by law.
The
following discussion of the results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations
that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of
events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements because of a number of factors. An
investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should carefully
consider the risks set forth in the Risk Factors and Business sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30,
2022, filed with the SEC on October 7, 2022. Our management has compiled the forward-looking statements specified in the following
information based on assumptions made by management and considered by management to be reasonable. Our future operating results,
however, are impossible to predict and no representation, guaranty, or warranty is to be inferred from those forward-looking
statements.
The
assumptions used for purposes of the forward-looking statements specified in the following information represent estimates of future
events and are subject to uncertainty as to possible changes in economic, legislative, industry, and other circumstances. As a result,
the identification and interpretation of data and other information and their use in developing and selecting assumptions from and among
reasonable alternatives require the exercise of judgment. To the extent that the assumed events do not occur, the outcome may vary substantially
from anticipated or projected results, and, accordingly, no opinion is expressed on the achievability of those forward-looking statements.
No assurance can be given that any of the assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements specified in the following information
are accurate, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
Overview
& Management Plans
In
March 2022, the Company commenced operations as a web3 enterprise. The Company generates revenue as a liquidity provider, via decentralized
exchanges such as Uniswap. Additionally, the Company farms tokens via Proof-of-Stake (“PoS”) protocols on decentralized exchanges,
as well as centralized exchanges, including Coinbase. Yield farmers provide liquidity to various token pairs and earn rewards in cryptocurrencies.
The Company also invests in non-fungible token (“NFT”) projects and virtual land that it believes are promising, primarily
on Ethereum Virtual Machine (“EVM”) protocols.
Web3
includes many different technologies but is generally defined as the use of internet protocols incentivized with token-based rewards
built on top of open source, decentralized and distributed systems. Examples of web3 technologies include blockchain networks, cryptocurrencies,
NFTs and smart contracts.
The
Company primarily invests in NFT collections from Yuga Labs which includes the Mutant Ape Yacht Club and the metaverse platform. As
of December 31, 2022, we are invested in 20 NFT tokens with a carrying value of $90,371. If sold, our NFTs may require the
payment of a royalty to the creator. Our NFTs currently do not generated royalties or other income.
EVM
is a computation engine that facilitates the deployment and operation of smart contracts.
14
The
Company has four areas of focus:
●
Liquidity
Provider - In decentralized finance (“DeFi”), the ability to trade assets from one to another is facilitated by Liquidity
Pools (“LPs”) which generally contain a 50/50 balance between both underlying tokens. The Company expects to invest substantially
in LPs to generate ongoing revenue. The Company earns income based on a percentage of the value of each trade for providing liquidity.
We expect that this revenue will fuel our other initiatives as we build the Company.
●
Staking
- Like LPs, staking can provide potential revenue to the Company. Purchasing large blocks of lucrative PoS assets to grow the passive
income portfolio is expected to be a major cornerstone to our success. This is a much greener approach to the traditional Proof of
Work model, which is used by Bitcoin.
●
NFTs
- The Company holds NFTs for capital appreciation and for potential income from IP licensing.
●
Bitcoin
Mining Operations
At
December 31, 2022, the Company was invested
in
Uniswap V3 (liquidity pool), CAKE (staking) and NFTs.
On
August 29, 2022, the Company announced its plan to begin bitcoin mining operations. Bitcoin mining has been part of the Company roadmap
since entering the web3 space in March 2022, although our plans have been accelerated with the recent decrease in the price of Bitcoin.
Mining equipment has become much more affordable as overleveraged miners are forced to sell equipment at reduced prices. In August 2022,
the Company began its Bitcoin mining operations by purchasing cryptocurrency mining machines and arranging hosting space in Texas. We
anticipate the Company will eventually open a second site in Georgia.
Bitcoin
Mining Operations
On
August 22, 2022, the Company made a deposit of $72,095 with USDC to purchase 18 Antminer S19j Pro 100 TH
Bitcoin mining machines.
The Company originally expected delivery and deployment of these machines in December 2022. These machines were deployed, became operational and started to generate revenue on February 7, 2023. The delay is due to the lack of electric power at the host. The host was seeking permission from the electric
utility to turn the power on for these machines.
The
Company plans to earn transaction fees with its crypto mining machines by validating requesting customers’ transactions to a
distributing ledger. We joined a mining pool and expect to receive a pro-rata share of a bitcoin award for completing a
blockchain.
The
Company has entered into digital asset mining pools by entering into an agreement with one mining pool operator The agreement is terminable
at any time by either party. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency
award the mining pool operator receives (less digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are immaterial and are
recorded as a deduction from revenue), for successfully adding a block to the blockchain. The Company’s fractional share is based
on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by
all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm.
Providing
computing power in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. The provision
of providing such computing power is the only performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with mining pool operators. The
transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration, which the Company measures at fair value on the date
received, which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the time the Company has earned the award from
the pools. The consideration is all variable. Because it is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur,
the consideration is constrained until the mining pool operator successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm)
and the Company receives confirmation of the consideration it will receive, at which time revenue is recognized. There is no significant
financing component in these transactions.
Fair
value of the cryptocurrency award received is determined using the quoted price of the related cryptocurrency at the time of receipt.
Critical
Accounting Policies
Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our
management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements
which we have been prepared in accordance with the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In preparing our
financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods.
Critical
accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment
necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate
on financial condition or operating performance is material. These significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change
due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult
to measure or value.
Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial
statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions
used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and
reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly.
Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
While
our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our unaudited financial statements included in this
Quarterly Report, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
our unaudited financial statements:
Assumption
as a Going Concern
Management
prepares the Company’s financial statements on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
continuity of operations, the realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, given
our current financial position and lack of liquidity, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Convertible
Financial Instruments
The
Company bifurcates conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments
if certain criteria are met. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative
instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument
that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable
generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument
with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when
the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under applicable GAAP.
15
When
the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments, discounts are recorded
for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in the instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying
common stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the instrument.
Intangible
Assets
Digital
assets held by the Company are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, and are initially measured at cost. The
Company assigns costs to transactions on a first-in, first-out basis (FIFO).
An
intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events
or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment
exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the digital assets at the time its
fair value is being measured.
Tokens
are subject to impairment losses if the fair value a tokens decreases below the carrying value at any time during the period. The fair
value is measured using the quoted price in the principal market of the tokens. The Company currently obtains the quoted price of tokens
from
www.cryptocompare.com .
Liquidity
pool tokens and non-fungible tokens are subject to impairment losses if the fair value a token decreases below the carrying value at
the end of each quarterly accounting period. The fair value of liquidity pool tokens is based on the quoted price on the last day of
the quarter at 4PM Eastern Time. The fair value of NFTs is based on the average trading price on the last day of each quarter.
Impairment
for liquidity pool tokens and non-fungible tokens is assessed quarterly due to each token being a unique asset and due to the illiquid
markets in which these tokens trade. The Company is continuously reviewing available markets and information and its methodology when
determining the fair value of digital assets.
The
Company currently reviews quoted prices of its liquidity pool tokens, non-fungible tokens and comparable tokens at
https://uniswap.org/
and
https://opensea.io . Impairment expense is reflected in total expense in the statements of operations. Subsequent reversal
of impairment losses is not permitted.
The
sales of digital assets held are included within investing activities in the accompanying statements of cash flows and any realized gains
or losses from such sales are included in other income (expense) in the statements of operations.
Revenue
recognition
The
Company recognizes revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:
●
Step
1: Identify the contract with the customer
●
Step
2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract
●
Step
3: Determine the transaction price
●
Step
4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
●
Step
5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation
Revenue
is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration
the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company generates revenue through liquidity pools
and staking rewards.
16
Liquidity
Pools
Liquidity
pools are a collection of digital assets locked in a smart contract that provide liquidity to decentralized exchanges. Liquidity allows
digital assets to be converted to cash quickly and efficiently without drastic price swings. An important component of a liquidity pool
are automated market makers (AMM). An AMM is a protocol that uses liquidity pools to allow digital assets to be traded by a mathematical
formula rather than though a traditional market of buyers and sellers.
The
Company earns fees by providing liquidity on Uniswap V2 and Uniswap V3. The Company earns fees proportionate to the liquidity they have
supplied to the exchange. The fee for each trade is set at 0.05% for stable coins, 0.3% for most pairs and 1.0% for exotic pairs. The
fees earned by the Company depends on the risk characteristics of each pair of tokens selected and the price range liquidity is provided.
Uniswap V2 requires users to provide liquidity over the entire price curve, whereas Uniswap V3 provides users with liquidity over a price
range.
Revenue
is recognized from liquidity pools when the award is claimed and deposited in the Company wallet. The transaction consideration the Company
receives is noncash in the form of digital assets. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the digital asset awards received.
Staking
Rewards
Staking
rewards are granted to holders of a crypto asset when the holders lock up that crypto asset as collateral to secure fairness when validating
transactions or other network actions.
The
Company participates in networks with proof-of-stake consensus algorithms, through creating or validating blocks on the network. In exchange
for participating in the consensus mechanism of these networks, the Company earns rewards in the form of the native token of the network.
Each block creation or validation is a performance obligation. Revenue is recognized at the point when the block creation or validation
is complete and the rewards are transferred into a digital wallet that the Company controls. Revenue is measured based on the number
of tokens received and the fair value of the token at contract inception.
Airdrops
Airdrops
are the distribution of tokens without compensation generally undertaken with a view of increasing awareness of a new token, to encourage
adoption of a new token and to increase liquidity in the early stages of a token project.
The
Company recognizes crypto assets received through an airdrop if the crypto asset is expected to generate a probable future benefit and
if the Company is able to support the trading, custody, or withdrawal of these assets.
Airdrops
are accounted for in accordance with ASC 610-20 , Sales and Transfer of Nonfinancial Assets,
Receipt of a airdrops are classified
as gains on the statement of operations.
Beneficial
Conversion Feature
The
issuance of the convertible debt issued by the Company generated a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”), which arises when
a debt or equity security is issued with an embedded conversion option that is beneficial to the investor or in the money at inception
because the conversion option has an effective strike price that is less than the market price of the underlying stock at the commitment
date. The Company recognized the BCF by allocating the intrinsic value of the conversion option, which is the number of shares of common
stock available upon conversion multiplied by the difference between the effective conversion price per share and the fair value of common
stock per share on the commitment date, resulting in a discount on the convertible debt (recorded as a component of additional paid-in
capital).
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB ASC for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted
paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the ASC (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph
820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase
consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy
which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The three (3) levels of
fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:
Level
1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level
2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable
as of the reporting date.
Level
3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar
techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.
The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than
one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of
the instrument.
Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arms-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market
dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions
were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.
17
Deferred
Tax Assets and Income Taxes Provision
The
Company adopted the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13 of the ASC. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 which addresses the determination of whether
tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under paragraph 740-10-25-13,
the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will
be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in
the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood
of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest,
and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments
to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13.
The
estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying
balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred
tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.
Management
makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates
of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions.
In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction
varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.
Management
assumes that the realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss (“NOL”)
carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not
and accordingly, a full valuation allowance offsets the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards. Management made this assumption
based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses and presently has no revenue-producing business, (b) general economic conditions,
and (c) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering, among other factors.
Comparison
of Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Revenue
In
March 2022, the Company commenced operations as a web3 enterprise and purchasing digital assets. Revenue for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021 was derived
from
liquidity pool fees of $43,464 and $0,
respectively.
Our
business plan includes earning income from liquidity fees and staking .
The Company seeks higher returns from liquidity pool fees by selecting pairs with higher risk and good volumes.
Our
high trade volume is due to adjusting parameters on our liquidity pools. Each trade generates a realized gain or loss.
Administrative
Expenses
Administrative
expenses totaled $52,500 and $29,185 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These expenses are primarily
costs related to accounting, audit, legal and investor relations.
Interest
Expense
Interest
expense totaled $24,991 and $0 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in interest expense
is due to amortization of debt discount and accrued interest on new promissory notes and new convertible promissory notes issued since
October 2021.
18
Impairment
of Digital Assets Held
Impairment
of digital assets held totaled $256,018 and $0 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Digital assets are
accounted for as intangible assets are subject to impairment losses if the fair value of digital assets decreases below the carrying
value at any time during the period. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. We will not recognize any increases in
the fair value of digital assets held until a gain is recognized on sale. Impairment losses are a non-cash expense.
Other
Income (Expense)
Other
rewards – we earned $GOO tokens as a result of holding an Art Gobblers NFT.
Realized
Gain on Sale/ Exchange on Digital Assets Held
- We generally do not seek to earn income from actively
trading digital assets held. We will dispose of assets in circumstances when there is a significant increase in the fair value of an asset
or when holding an asset is no longer consistent with our business plan.
Net
Loss
We
reported a net loss of $107,015 and $29,185 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Any increase in revenue
and realized gain on sales/ exchange on digital assets held was offset by an increase in administrative, interest and impairment expenses.
Our
losses were primarily due to a steep drop in market price of crypto assets, high volatility of prices and a broad deterioration of the
crypto-currency market. During 2022, there has been a sustained period of lower prices. The broad deterioration of the crypto-currency
market has been highlighted by well publicized business failures such as FTX Exchange and BlockFi and the price collapse of TerraUSD
and LUNA. We have not suffered direct losses as a counterparty in a contract as a result of recent business failures. The broad deterioration
in prices has reduced the capital we can invest and, therefore, reduced our revenue from liquidity pools and staking rewards. We are
unable to predict if or when prices will recover.
Comparison
of Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Revenue
In
March 2022, the Company commenced operations as a web3 enterprise and purchasing digital assets. Revenue for the six months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021 was derived liquidity pool fees of $83,894 and $0, respectively.
Our
business plan includes earning income from liquidity fees and staking .
The Company seeks higher returns from liquidity pool fees by selecting pairs with higher risk and good volumes.
Our
high trade volume is due to adjusting parameters on our liquidity pools. Each trade generates a realized gain or loss.

Administrative
expenses totaled $177,510 and $51,010 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These expenses are primarily
costs related to accounting, audit, legal and investor relations.
Interest
Expense
Interest
expense totaled $48,533 and $2,997 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in interest expense
is due to amortization of debt discount and accrued interest on new promissory notes and new convertible promissory notes issued since
October 2021.
19
Impairment
of Digital Assets Held
Impairment
of digital assets held totaled $281,317 and $0 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Digital assets are
accounted for as intangible assets are subject to impairment losses if the fair value of digital assets decreases below the carrying
value at any time during the period. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. We will not recognize any increases in
the fair value of digital assets held until a gain is recognized on sale. Impairment losses are a non-cash expense.

We
reported a net loss of $165,326 and $54,007 during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Any increase in revenue
and realized gain on sales/ exchange on digital assets held was offset by an increase in administrative, interest and impairment expenses.
Our

in prices has reduced the capital we can invest and, therefore, reduced our revenue from liquidity pools and staking rewards. We are
unable to predict if or when prices will recover.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
We
have incurred recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows through December 31, 2022, and we expect to continue to
incur losses and negative operating cash flows at least through the near future. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we obtained $75,000 of funding by issuing a demand promissory note and promissory note – related party to meet our most
critical cash requirements. At December 31, 2022, $972 of cash was in held at a financial institution and $0 was held at Coinbase,
Inc. The Company expects over the next twelve months, cash held at a financial institution will be expended on professional fees,
transfer agent, Edgar agent and other administrative costs. We estimate $200,000 of cash per annum will be required to maintain
current operations and remain in business. We hope that we can generate enough revenue from liquidity pools and staking rewards to
pay ongoing expenses. In order to remain in business we may have to sell digital assets for cash or issue additional debt order
equity. The cash held at Coinbase Inc. will be deployed to purchase digital assets to generate staking rewards and liquidity pool
fees. We hope to start paying some of our suppliers and contractors in digital assets in the coming months. However, there can be no
assurance we will be able to pay any of our suppliers and contractors in digital assets.
On
August 22, 2022, the Company made a deposit of $72,095 with USDC to purchase 18 Antminer S19j Pro 100 TH
Bitcoin mining machines.
As
a result of the aforementioned factors, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our fiscal 2022 financial statements, expressed substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022, do not contain
any adjustments for this uncertainty. In response to our Company’s cash needs, we raised funding as described in Note 5 and Note
6 to our financial statements. Any additional amounts raised will be used for our future investing and operating cash flow needs. However,
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional amounts of financing.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e))
under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our Company in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time specified in the Commission’s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our Company carried out an evaluation as of December 31, 2022 with the participation of our
Company’s management, including our Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and our Company’s Chief Financial
Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of our Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Company’s CEO and CFO concluded that our Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to our Company’s limited internal resources and lack of ability to
have multiple levels of transaction review.
Management
is in the process of determining how best to change our current system and implement a more effective system to insure that information
required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act have been recorded, processed, summarized and reported
accurately. Our management intends to develop procedures to address the current deficiencies to the extent possible given limitations
in financial and personnel resources. While management is working on a plan, no assurance can be made at this point that the implementation
of such controls and procedures will be completed in a timely manner or that they will be adequate once implemented.
Changes
in internal control over financial reporting
There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period ended December 31, 2022 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From
time to time, we may be involved in routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the
normal course of our business. The ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any claims of any type (either alone or in the aggregate)
may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, the ultimate outcome of
any litigation is uncertain. Any outcome (including any for the actions described above), whether favorable or unfavorable, may materially
and adversely affect us due to legal costs and expenses, diversion of management attention and other factors. We expense legal costs
in the period incurred. We cannot assure you that additional contingencies of a legal nature or contingencies having legal aspects will
not be asserted against us in the future, and these matters could relate to prior, current or future transactions or events.
We
are not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings. We are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation against us
that in our view would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results. However,
legal claims are inherently uncertain, and we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected in the future by legal proceedings.

1A. RISK FACTORS
Investing
in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before investing in our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks described
below, together with the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The occurrence
of any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth
prospects. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
For
a discussion identifying risk factors and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated,
see the discussions under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2022 and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There has been a material change
to the Risk Factors described in Part I “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 as filed with the SEC.
The
following additional risk factor should be added to the discussions under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
A
particular digital asset’s status as a “security” in any relevant jurisdiction is subject to a high degree of uncertainty,
and if we are unable to correctly characterize a digital asset, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, sanctions,
penalties and other adverse consequences, including potentially becoming subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 which would impose
significant regulatory burdens and compliance costs.
The
SEC and its staff have taken the position that certain digital assets fall within the definition of a “security” under the
U.S. federal securities laws. The legal test for determining whether any given digital asset is a security is a highly complex, fact-driven
analysis that evolves over time, and the outcome is difficult to predict. The SEC generally does not provide advance guidance or confirmation
on the status of any particular digital asset as a security. Furthermore, the SEC’s views in this area have evolved over time and
it is difficult to predict the direction or timing of any continuing evolution. It is also possible that a change in the governing administration
or the appointment of new SEC commissioners could substantially impact the views of the SEC and its staff. Public statements by senior
officials at the SEC indicate that the SEC does not intend to take the position that Bitcoin or Ethereum are securities (in their current
form). Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only digital assets as to which senior officials at the SEC have publicly expressed such a view.
Moreover, such statements are not official policy statements by the SEC and reflect only the speakers’ views, which are not binding
on the SEC or any other agency or court and cannot be generalized to any other digital asset. With respect to all other digital assets,
there is currently no certainty under the applicable legal test that such assets are not securities, notwithstanding the conclusions
we may draw based on our risk-based assessment regarding the likelihood that a particular digital asset could be deemed a “security”
under applicable laws. Similarly, though the SEC’s Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology published a framework
for analyzing whether any given digital asset is a security in April 2019, this framework is also not a rule, regulation or statement
of the SEC and is not binding on the SEC.
22
The
classification of a digital asset as a security under applicable law has wide-ranging implications for the regulatory obligations that
flow from the offer, sale, trading, and clearing of such assets. For example, a digital asset that is a security in the U.S. may generally
only be offered or sold in the U.S. pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC or in an offering that qualifies for an exemption
from registration. Persons that effect transactions in digital assets that are securities in the U.S. may be subject to registration
with the SEC as a “broker” or “dealer.” Platforms that bring together purchasers and sellers to trade digital
assets that are securities in the U.S. are generally subject to registration as national securities exchanges, or must qualify for an
exemption, such as by being operated by a registered broker-dealer as an alternative trading system, or ATS, in compliance with rules
for ATSs. Persons facilitating clearing and settlement of securities may be subject to registration with the SEC as a clearing agency.
Foreign jurisdictions may have similar licensing, registration, and qualification requirements.
While
we do not currently, nor do we plan to, offer, sell, trade, and clear digital assets or take custody of others digital assets as part
of any potential Staking-as-a-Service operations we may undertake, however, digital assets we stake and validate transactions for could
be deemed to be a “security” under applicable laws. Our blockchain infrastructure operations which entails securing blockchains
by processing and validating blockchain transactions (most analogous to Bitcoin mining or operating a Bitcoin mining pool) could be construed
as facilitating transactions in digital assets; as such we could be subject to legal or regulatory action in the event the SEC, a foreign
regulatory authority, or a court were to determine that a blockchain we secure is a “security” under applicable laws. Because
our platform is not registered or licensed with the SEC or foreign authorities as a broker-dealer, national securities exchange, or ATS
(or foreign equivalents), and we do not seek to register or rely on an exemption from such registration or license to secure blockchains.
Further,
if any digital asset is deemed to be a security under any U.S. federal, state, or foreign jurisdiction, or in a proceeding in a court
of law or otherwise, it may have adverse consequences for such digital asset. For instance, the networks on which such digital assets
are utilized may be required to be regulated as securities intermediaries, and subject to applicable rules, which could effectively render
the network impracticable for its existing purposes. Further, it could draw negative publicity and a decline in the general acceptance
of the digital asset. Also, such a development may make it difficult for such supported digital asset to be traded, cleared, and custodied
as compared to other digital asset that are not considered to be securities.
