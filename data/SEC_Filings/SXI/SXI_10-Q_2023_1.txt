S TANDEX INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
Notes to Unaudited   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
1 )     Management Statement
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021 , the cash flows for the
six
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021  and the financial position of Standex International Corporation (“Standex”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), at
December 31, 2022 . The interim results are
not
necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information
not
misleading. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes do
not
contain information which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited annual consolidated financial statements and notes for the year ended
June 30, 2022 . The condensed consolidated balance sheet at
June 30, 2022  was derived from audited financial statements, but does
not
include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial statements contained herein should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form
10 -K and in particular the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
June 30, 2022 . Unless otherwise noted, references to years are to the Company’s fiscal years. Currently our fiscal year end is
June 30.
For further clarity, our fiscal year
2023  includes the
twelve -month period from
July 1, 2022
to
June 30, 2023.
The estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements have considered the implications on the Company as a result of the COVID- 19
pandemic and its related economic impacts. As a result of the COVID- 19
pandemic, there is heightened volatility and uncertainty around supply chain performance, labor availability, and customer demand. However, the magnitude of such impact on the Company’s business and its duration is uncertain. The Company is
not
aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates or adjustments to the carrying value of its assets and liabilities as of
December 31, 2022
and the issuance date of the Quarterly Report on Form
10 -Q.
The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued to provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date and time its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In
November 2021,
the FASB issued ASU
2021 - 10,
Government Assistance (Topic
832 ): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance, which requires business entities to provide certain disclosures when they ( 1 ) have received government assistance and ( 2 ) use a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy to other accounting guidance. The guidance in ASU
2021 - 10
is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2021
with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU  2021 - 10  in fiscal year  2023.  The adoption did  not  have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
2 )     Acquisitions
At the time of the acquisition and
December 31, 2022 , the Company evaluated the significance of each acquisition on a standalone basis and in aggregate, considering both qualitative and quantitative factors.
Sensor Solutions
During the
third
quarter of fiscal year
2022,
the Company acquired Sensor Solutions, a designer and manufacturer of customized standard magnetic sensor products including hall effect switch and latching sensors, linear and rotary sensors, and specialty sensors. Sensor Solutions' customer base in automotive, industrial, medical, aerospace, military and consumer electronics end markets are a strategic fit and expand the Company's presence in these markets. Sensor Solutions operates
one
light manufacturing facility in Colorado. Sensor Solutions' results are reported within the Company's Electronics segment.
9
The Company paid $ 9.9
million in cash for all the issued and outstanding equity interests of Sensor Solutions. The purchase price was allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a valuation of their fair values on the closing date. Goodwill recorded from this transaction is attributable to Sensor Solutions' technical and applications expertise in sectors such as electric vehicles, industrial automation and medical end markets, which is highly complementary to the Company's existing business.
Identifiable intangible assets of $ 2.8
million consist primarily of $ 0.8
million for indefinite lived tradenames, and $ 2.0
million of customer relationships to be amortized over
10
years. The goodwill of $ 5.8
million created by the transaction is deductible for income tax purposes. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments regarding expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocations of those cash flows to identifiable tangible and intangible assets, in determining the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's best estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.

3 )     Revenue From Contracts With Customers
Most of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation which represents the product or service being sold to the customer. Some contracts include multiple performance obligations such as a product and the related installation and/or extended warranty. Additionally, most of the Company’s contracts offer assurance type warranties in connection with the sale of a product to customers. Assurance type warranties provide a customer with assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications. Assurance type warranties do
not
represent a separate performance obligation.
In general, the Company recognizes revenue at the point in time control transfers to its customer based on predetermined shipping terms. Revenue is recognized over time under certain long-term contracts within the Engineering Technologies and Engraving groups for highly customized customer products that have
no
alternative use and in which the contract specifies the Company has a right to payment for its costs, plus a reasonable margin. For products manufactured over time, the transfer of control is measured pro rata, based upon current estimates of costs to complete such contracts. Losses on contracts are fully recognized in the period in which the losses become determinable. Revisions in profit estimates are reflected on a cumulative basis in the period in which the basis for such revision becomes known.

Contract Balances
Contract assets represent sales recognized in excess of billings related to work completed but
not
yet shipped for which revenue is recognized over time. Contract assets are recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets. Contract liabilities are customer deposits for which revenue has
not
been recognized. Current contract liabilities are recorded as accrued liabilities.
The timing of revenue recognition, invoicing and cash collections results in billed receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. When consideration is received from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a contract, a contract liability is recorded. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue after control of the goods and services are transferred to the customer and all revenue recognition criteria have been met.

4 )      Fair Value Measurements
The financial instruments shown below are presented at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are
not
available, valuation models
may
be applied.
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities and the methodologies used in valuation are as follows:
Level
1
– Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The Company’s deferred compensation plan assets consist of shares in various mutual funds (investments are participant-directed) which invest in a broad portfolio of debt and equity securities. These assets are valued based on publicly quoted market prices for the funds’ shares as of the balance sheet dates.
Level
2
– Inputs, other than quoted prices in an active market, that are observable either directly or indirectly through correlation with market data. For foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps, the Company values the instruments based on the market price of instruments with similar terms, which are based on spot and forward rates as of the balance sheet dates. The Company has considered the creditworthiness of counterparties in valuing all assets and liabilities.
Level
3
– Unobservable inputs based upon the Company’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
There were
no
transfers of assets or liabilities between any levels of the fair value measurement hierarchy at
December 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022 . The Company’s policy is to recognize transfers between levels as of the date they occur.
Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

The financial liabilities based upon Level
3
inputs include contingent consideration arrangements relating to the acquisitions of Renco Electronics. The Company is contractually obligated to pay contingent consideration payments to the Sellers of these businesses based on the achievement of certain criteria.
The Company is contractually obligated to pay contingent consideration to the sellers of GS Engineering in the event that certain revenue and gross margin targets are achieved during the
five
years following acquisition. The targets set in the GS Engineering stock purchase agreement were
not
met for the first, second, or
third
year, which concluded in the
fourth
quarter of fiscal years
2020,
2021
and
2022,
respectively. As of
December 31, 2022 , the Company could be required to pay up to $ 12.8
million for contingent consideration arrangements if the revenue and gross margin targets are met in fiscal years
2023  through
2024.
In connection with its acquisition of Renco Electronics, the Company was obligated to pay contingent consideration over a
three
year period of up to $ 3.5
million to the sellers of Renco. During the
first
quarter of fiscal year
2022,
the Company paid $ 1.2
million to the sellers as Renco exceeded the earnings targets during the
first
year of the measurement peri od. During the  third  quarter of fiscal year  2022 ,  the parties agreed to reduce and fix the aggregate earnout payments to a total of $ 3.4  million. The parties also agreed to accelerate the payment of the remaining unpaid amounts. During the  fourth  quarter of fiscal year  2022 ,  the Company paid $ 1.0  million to the sellers of Renco. The remaining unpaid amount of $ 1.2  million was paid in the
first
quarter of fiscal year
2023
and the obligation is considered settled.
The Company has determined the fair value of the liabilities for the contingent consideration based on a probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis. This fair value
measurement is based on significant inputs  not  observable in the market and thus represents a Level  3  measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with future payments was based on several factors, the most significant of which are the financial performance of the acquired businesses and the risk-adjusted discount rate for the fair value measurement.
The Company will update its assumptions each reporting period based on new developments and record such amounts at fair value based on the revised assumptions until the agreements expire.

Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates, commodity prices and changes in foreign currency rates. The Company selectively uses derivative financial instruments in order to manage certain of these risks. Information about the Company’s derivative financial instruments is as follows:
Interest Rate Swaps
From time to time as dictated by market opportunities, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements designed to manage exposure to interest rates on the Company’s variable rate indebtedness. The Company recognizes all derivatives on its balance sheet at fair value. The Company has designated its interest rate swap agreements, including those that
may
be forward-dated, as cash flow hedges, and changes in the fair value of the swaps are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged items are recognized in earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, associated with the swaps will be reported by the Company in interest expense.
The Company’s effective swap agreements convert the base borrowing rate on $ 175
million of debt due under our revolving credit agreement from a variable rate equal to
1
month LIBOR to a weighted average fixed rate of
1.18 % at
December 31, 2022 . The fair value of the swaps, recognized in accrued liabilities or other current assets and in other comprehensive income, is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):

The Company reported
no
losses for the
three
and
six
months ended
December 31, 2022 , as a result of hedge ineffectiveness. Future changes in these swap arrangements, including termination of the agreements,
may
result in a reclassification of any gain or loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to these instruments is being amortized into interest expense concurrent with the hedged exposure.
Foreign Exchange Contracts
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used to limit the impact of currency fluctuations on certain anticipated foreign cash flows, such as collections from customers and loan payments between subsidiaries. The Company enters into such contracts for hedging purposes only. The Company has designated certain of these currency contracts as hedges, and changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged items are recognized in earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, associated with these contracts will be reported in net income. At
December 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022 , the Company had outstanding forward contracts related to hedges of intercompany loans with net unrealized losses of $ 0.6
million and losses of $ 0.6  million, respectively, which approximate the unrealized gains and losses on the related loans. The contracts have maturity dates ranging from fiscal year  2024
to
2025,
which correspond to the related intercompany loans.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Statements contained in this Quarterly Report that are not based on historical facts are
“ forward-looking statements ”
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as
“ should, ”
“ could, ”
“ may, ”
“ will, ”
“ expect, ”
“ believe, ”
“ estimate, ”
“ anticipate, ”
“ intend, ”
“ continue, ”
or similar terms or variations of those terms or the negative of those terms. There are many factors that affect the Company ’ s business and the results of its operations and that may cause the actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or anticipated.   These factors include, but are not limited to: the impact of pandemics such as the current coronavirus on employees, our supply chain, and the demand for our products and services around the world; materially adverse or unanticipated legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements; conditions in the financial and banking markets, including fluctuations in exchange rates and the inability to repatriate foreign cash; domestic and international economic conditions, including the impact, length and degree of economic downturns on the customers and markets we serve and more specifically conditions in the automotive, construction, aerospace, defense, transportation, food service equipment, consumer appliance, energy, oil and gas and general industrial markets; lower-cost competition; the relative mix of products which impact margins and operating efficiencies in certain of our businesses; the impact of higher raw material and component costs, particularly steel, certain materials used in electronics parts, petroleum based products, and refrigeration components; the impact of higher transportation and logistics costs, especially with respect to transportation of goods from Asia; the impact of inflation on the costs of providing our products and services; an inability to realize the expected cost savings from restructuring activities including effective completion of plant consolidations, cost reduction efforts including procurement savings and productivity enhancements, capital management improvements, strategic capital expenditures, and the implementation of lean enterprise manufacturing techniques; the potential for losses associated with the exit from or divestiture of businesses that are no longer strategic or no longer meet our growth and return expectations; the inability to achieve the savings expected from global sourcing of raw materials and diversification efforts in emerging markets; the impact on cost structure and on economic conditions as a result of actual and threatened increases in trade tariffs; the inability to attain expected benefits from acquisitions and the inability to effectively consummate and integrate such acquisitions and achieve synergies envisioned by the Company; market acceptance of our products; our ability to design, introduce and sell new products and related product components; the ability to redesign certain of our products to continue meeting evolving regulatory requirements; the impact of delays initiated by our customers; our ability to increase manufacturing production to meet demand including as a result of labor shortages; and potential changes to future pension funding requirements.   In addition, any forward-looking statements represent management's estimates only as of the day made and should not be relied upon as representing management's estimates as of any subsequent date. While the Company may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, the Company and management specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if management's estimates change.
Overview
We are a diversified industrial manufacturer with leading positions in a variety of products and services that are used in diverse commercial and industrial markets. Headquartered in Salem, New Hampshire, we have seven operating segments aggregated into five reportable segments: Electronics, Engraving, Scientific, Engineering Technologies, and Specialty Solutions. Three operating segments are aggregated into Specialty Solutions. Our businesses work in close partnership with our customers to deliver custom solutions or engineered components that solve their unique and specific needs, an approach we call "Customer Intimacy".
Our long-term business strategy is to create, improve, and enhance shareholder value by building more profitable, focused industrial platforms through our Standex Value Creation System. This methodology employs four components: Balanced Performance Plan, Growth Disciplines, Operational Excellence, and Talent Management and provides both a company-wide framework and tools used to achieve our goals. We intend to continue investing organically and inorganically in high margin and growth businesses using this balanced and proven approach.
It is our objective to grow larger and more profitable business units through both organic and inorganic initiatives. We have a particular focus on identifying and investing in opportunities that complement our products and will increase the overall scale, global presence and capabilities of our businesses.  We recently established an innovation and technology function focused on accelerating new, longer-term growth opportunities for emerging technologies, including our ongoing development project with a global renewable energy company. We continue to execute on acquisitions where strategically aligned with our businesses and where the opportunity meets our investment metrics. We have divested, and likely will continue to divest, businesses that we feel are not strategic or do not meet our growth and return expectations.
26
As part of our ongoing strategy:
●
In the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, w e signed an agreement to  divest our Procon business for $75 million, subject to customary closing conditions. This transaction reflects the continued simplification of our portfolio and enables greater focus on managing our larger platforms and pursuing growth opportunities. Proceeds will be deployed towards organic and inorganic initiatives and returning capital to shareholders. Its results are reported within our Specialty Solutions segment.
●
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we acquired Sensor Solutions, a designer and manufacturer of customized standard magnetic sensor products including hall effect switch and latching sensors, linear and rotary sensors, and specialty sensors. Sensor Solutions' customer base in automotive, industrial, medical, aerospace, military and consumer electronics end markets are a strategic fit and expand our presence in these markets. Sensor Solution's operates one light manufacturing facility in Colorado. Its results are reported within our Electronics segment.
As a result of our portfolio moves over the past several years, we have transformed Standex to a company with a more focused group of businesses selling customized solutions to high value end markets via a compelling customer value proposition.  The narrowing of the portfolio allows for greater management focus on driving operational disciplines and positions us well to use our cash flow from operations to invest selectively in our ongoing pipeline of organic and inorganic opportunities.
The Company’s strong historical cash flow has been a cornerstone for funding our capital allocation strategy.  We use cash flow generated from operations to fund investments in capital assets to upgrade our facilities, improve productivity and lower costs, invest in the strategic growth programs described above, including organic growth and acquisitions, and to return cash to our shareholders through payment of dividends and stock buybacks.
Restructuring expenses reflect costs associated with our efforts of continuously improving operational efficiency and expanding globally in order to remain competitive in our end user markets. We incur costs for actions to size our businesses to a level appropriate for current economic conditions, improve our cost structure, enhance our competitive position and increase operating margins. Such expenses include costs for moving facilities to locations that allow for lower fixed and variable costs, external consultants who provide additional expertise starting up plants after relocation, downsizing operations because of changing economic conditions, and other costs resulting from asset redeployment decisions.  Shutdown costs include severance, benefits, stay bonuses, lease and contract terminations, asset write-downs, costs of moving fixed assets, and moving and relocation costs. Vacant facility costs include maintenance, utilities, property taxes and other costs.
Because of the diversity of the Company’s businesses, end user markets and geographic locations, management does not use specific external indices to predict the future performance of the Company, other than general information about broad macroeconomic trends.  Each of our individual business units serves niche markets and attempts to identify trends other than general business and economic conditions which are specific to its business and which could impact its performance. Those units report pertinent information to senior management, which uses it to the extent relevant to assess the future performance of the Company. A description of any such material trends is described below in the applicable segment analysis.
We monitor a number of key performance indicators (“KPIs”) including net sales, income from operations, backlog, effective income tax rate, gross profit margin, and operating cash flow. A discussion of these KPIs is included below. We may also supplement the discussion of these KPIs by identifying the impact of foreign exchange rates, acquisitions, and other significant items when they have a material impact on a specific KPI.
We believe the discussion of these items provides enhanced information to investors by disclosing their impact on the overall trend which provides a clearer comparative view of the KPI, as applicable.  For discussion of the impact of foreign exchange rates on KPIs, we calculate the impact as the difference between the current period KPI calculated at the current period exchange rate as compared to the KPI calculated at the historical exchange rate for the prior period.  For discussion of the impact of acquisitions, we isolate the effect on the KPI amount that would have existed regardless of such acquisition.  Sales resulting from synergies between the acquisition and existing operations of the Company are considered organic growth for the purposes of our discussion.
Unless otherwise noted, references to years are to fiscal years.
27
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company
Given the global nature of our business and the number of our facilities worldwide, we continue to be impacted globally by COVID-19 related issues. We have taken effective action around the world to protect our health and safety, continue to serve our customers, support our communities and manage our cash flows.  Our priority was and remains the health and safety of all of our employees.  Each of our facilities is following safe practices as defined in their local jurisdictions as well as sharing experiences and innovative ways of overcoming challenges brought on by the crisis during updates with global site leaders.  We are rigorously following health protocols in our plants, including changing work cell configurations and revising shift schedules when appropriate, in order to do our best to maintain operations.  While overall customer demand has rebounded from the impact of the pandemic, more recently we have been impacted by (i) supply chain shortages, (ii) increased material costs, (iii) labor shortages, especially in North America, and (iv) lockdowns implemented by the Chinese government in select cities in which we operate. Like other industrial manufacturers, we are impacted by rising inflation which we attempt to manage through appropriate pricing actions and enhanced production efficiency measures.
We exited the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 with $113.5 million in cash and $187.5 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  Our leverage ratio covenant, as defined in our revolving credit agreement, was 1.02 to 1 and allowed us the capacity to borrow an additional $323.6 million at December 31, 2022. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity around the world and access to financing to execute on our short and long-term strategic plans.
Finally, we continue to monitor our ability to participate in any governmental assistance programs available to us in each of our global locations and participate in these programs as available and appropriate.

Organic sales increased $22.9 million or 6.4%, primarily due to pricing actions and strong demand in our ETG, Engraving and Specialty segments, acquisitions had a $1.9 million impact on sales, while foreign currency had an $17.8 million or 4.9 % negative impact on sales.
Gross Profit Margin
Our gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 was 38.5%, which increased from the prior year quarter’s gross margin of 37.0%. This increase is primarily a result of organic sales increases, productivity and targeted pricing initiatives, partially offset by foreign currency, raw material availability and inflationary headwinds.
Our gross margin for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was 38.2%, which increased from the prior year gross margin of 37.4%. This increase is primarily a result of organic sales increases, productivity and targeted pricing initiatives and the absence of a one-time project related charge at Engineering Technologies during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, partially offset by foreign currency, raw material availability and inflationary headwinds.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses
Selling, General, and Administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 were $43.7 million, or 23.3% of sales, compared to $43.5 million, or 23.4% of sales, during the prior year quarter. SG&A expenses during the quarter were primarily impacted by increased research and development spending to drive future product initiatives partially offset by decreased distribution expenses.
Selling, General, and Administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were $84.8 million, or 23.0% of sales, compared to $86.3 million, or 23.9% of sales, during the prior year period. SG&A expenses during the period were primarily impacted by decreased distribution expenses, partially offset by increased research and development spending to drive future product initiatives.
29
Restructuring Charges
We incurred restructuring expenses of $0.5 million and $1.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 and the six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively primarily related to productivity improvements, facility rationalization activities, and global headcount reductions within our Engraving and Electronics segments.
We expect to incur restructuring costs of approximately $0.6 million throughout the remainder of fiscal year 2023, as we continue to focus our efforts to reduce cost and improve productivity across our businesses, particularly through headcount reductions and productivity initiatives.
Acquisition Related Expenses
We incurred acquisition related expenses of $0.2 million and $0.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 and the six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Acquisition related expenses typically consist of due diligence, integration, and valuation expenses incurred in connection with recent or pending acquisitions.
Income from Operations
Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 was $27.8 million, compared to $21.8 million during the prior year quarter.  The increase of $6.0 million, or 27.7%, is primarily due to income from organic sales increases and pricing actions, along with cost reduction activities and productivity improvement initiatives, partially offset by foreign currency, material inflation, and increased logistics and labor costs.
Income from operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $54.1 million, compared to $44.6 million during the prior year period.  The increase of $9.5 million, or 21.3%, is primarily due to income from organic sales increases and pricing actions, along with cost reduction activities and productivity improvement initiatives, partially offset by foreign currency, material inflation, and increased logistics and labor costs.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 was $1.6 million, a 2.6% increase from interest expense of $1.5 million during the prior year quarter. Interest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $2.8 million, a 15.2% decrease from interest expense of $3.2 million during the prior year period. Our effective interest rate in the six months ended December 31, 2022 was 2.47%.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 and for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was 23.7% and 23.8%, respectively compared with 24.7% and 24.8% for the prior year quarter and prior year period, respectively. The tax rate was impacted in the current period by the following items: (i) a discrete tax benefit related to equity compensation, (ii) the jurisdictional mix of earnings and (iii) foreign withholding taxes.
The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was enacted on August 16, 2022. The IRA includes provisions imposing a 1% excise tax on share repurchases and introduces a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) on adjusted financial statement income. The income tax provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2022. The 1% excise tax on share repurchases is effective as of January 1, 2023. We currently are not expecting the IRA to have a material impact to our financial statements.

Backlog
Backlog includes all active or open orders for goods and services. Backlog also includes any future deliveries based on executed customer contracts, so long as such deliveries are based on agreed upon delivery schedules. Backlog orders are not necessarily an indicator of future sales levels because of variations in lead times and customer production demand pull systems, with the exception of Engineering Technologies. Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Due to the nature of long-term agreements in the Engineering Technologies segment, the timing of orders and delivery dates can vary considerably resulting in significant backlog changes from one period to another.

Segment Analysis
Overall
Looking
forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2023, we expect to be well positioned to build on fiscal year 2022 and the  six months ended December 31, 2022
momentum, with anticipated year over year improvement in key financial metrics, supported by orders growth and productivity initiatives.
In general, for fiscal year 2023, we expect:
●
continued growth in transportation markets from electric vehicle programs, both the ramp up of existing business and new business opportunities;
●
a decline in vaccine storage demand after record COVID-19 related surge in fiscal year 2021 and early fiscal year 2022, affecting the first six months of fiscal year 2023 results, countered by a return of demand from universities and research institutions;
●
commercial aviation and defense end markets to remain strong with double digit sales increase from the prior year based on current program expectations;
●
space markets to remain attractive, with an anticipated moderate volume decline due to timing of production versus launch;
●
refuse and dump truck and dump trailer end markets to remain stable while being supported by investments in the U.S. infrastructure bill;
●
strong Merchandising  business to benefit from return to pre-COVID-19 demand levels in food service equipment markets.

Net sales in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 decreased $4.1 million, or 5.3%, when compared to the prior year quarter.  Organic sales decreased by $0.2 million or 0.2%. The segment continues to see positive trends in end markets like industrial applications, power management, renewable energy technologies, and electric vehicle related applications. Sensor Solutions was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, adding $0.8 million in sales for the quarter. The foreign currency impact decreased sales by $4.7 million, or 6.1%.
Income from operations in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 decreased by $0.2 million, or 1.1%, when compared to the prior year quarter. The operating income decrease was the result of lower sales, labor and materials inflation, and unfavorable foreign currency impacts, mostly offset by pricing and productivity initiatives.
Net sales in the six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased $4.7 million, or 3.1%, when compared to the prior year period.  Organic sales increased by $3.0 million or 1.9%, reflecting positive trends in end markets like industrial applications, power management, renewable energy technologies, and electric vehicle related applications. Sensor Solutions was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, adding $1.9 million in sales for the period. The foreign currency impact decreased sales by $9.6 million, or 6.3%.
Income from operations in the six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $0.3 million, or 0.9% when compared to the prior year period. The operating income decrease was the result of inflationary and foreign currency impacts almost fully offset by organic sales growth and various cost saving initiatives.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, on a sequential basis, we expect a slight to moderate revenue increase primarily due to strong demand across end markets in North America and increased sales into fast growth markets. We also expect sequentially similar to slightly lower operating margin due to unfavorable project mix and plant moves in China and Germany, which were completed in early January 2023.

Income from operations increased $2.4 million, or 74.5%, in the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period primarily due to volume increases, productivity and efficiency initiatives and the impact of a one-time project related charge in first quarter of fiscal year 2022 that did not repeat.
We continue to ex ecute on a healthy backlog in the Engineering Technologies Group.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, on a sequential basis, we expect a significant decrease in revenue reflecting timing of projects and a slight decrease in operating margin, as productivity actions mostly offset volume decline. We expect more favorable timing of projects in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023.

Corporate expenses in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 decreased by $0.3 million, or 3.5%, when compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease is related to employee related compensation accruals.
Corporate expenses in the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $0.3 million, or  1.9%, when compared to the prior year period. The increase is related to research and development costs and employee related compensation accruals.
The restructuring and acquisition related costs have been discussed above in the Company Overview. The decrease in other expenses is driven by a $1.7 million litigation accrual in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 that was settled in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.
34
Discontinued Operations
In pursuing our business strategy, the Company may divest certain businesses.  Future divestitures may be classified as discontinued operations based on their strategic significance to the Company. Net loss from discontinued operations was less than $0.1 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2022, our total cash balance was $113.5 million, of which $106.6 million was held by foreign subsidiaries.  During the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we repatriated $4.3 million of cash to the United States from our foreign subsidiaries. We expect to repatriate between $25.0 million and $30.0 million during the remainder of fiscal year 2023, however, the amount and timing of cash repatriation during the fiscal year will be dependent upon each business unit’s operational needs including requirements to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and jurisdictional tax payments. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to capital controls; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations.
Net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022, was $27.1 million compared to net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $36.7 million in the prior year.  We generated $55.9 million from operating activities and used $28.7 million of cash to fund working capital and other balance sheet increases.  Cash flow used in investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 totaled $10.9 million and primarily consisted of $11.0 million used for capital expenditures. Cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $7.6 million and consisted primarily of net borrowings of $12.5 million offset by purchases of stock of $13.5 million, cash paid for dividends of $6.4 million, and contingent consideration payments due to the seller of the Renco business of $1.2 million.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we entered into a five-year Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“credit agreement”, or “facility”) with a borrowing limit of $500 million.  The facility can be increased by an amount of up to $250 million, in accordance with specified conditions contained in the agreement.  The facility also includes a $10 million sublimit for swing line loans and a $35 million sublimit for letters of credit.
Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we pay a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee on borrowed amounts as well as a commitment fee on unused amounts under the facility.  The amount of the commitment fee depends upon both the undrawn amount remaining available under the facility and the Company’s funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) ratio at the last day of each quarter.  As our funded debt to EBITDA ratio increases, the commitment fee increases.
35
Funds borrowed under the facility may be used for the repayment of debt, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions (so long as certain conditions, including a specified funded debt to EBITDA leverage ratio is maintained), and other general corporate purposes.  As of December 31, 2022, the Company used $6.0 million against the letter of credit sub-facility and had the ability to borrow $323.6 million under the facility based on our current trailing twelve-month EBITDA.  The facility contains customary representations, warranties and restrictive covenants, as well as specific financial covenants. The Company’s current financial covenants under the facility are as follows:
Interest Coverage Ratio
- The Company is required to maintain a ratio of Earnings Before Interest and Taxes, as Adjusted (“Adjusted EBIT per the Credit Facility”), to interest expense for the trailing twelve months of at least 2.75:1.  Adjusted EBIT per the Credit Facility specifically excludes extraordinary and certain other defined items such as cash restructuring and acquisition related charges up to the lower of $20.0 million or 10% of EBITDA.  The facility also allows for unlimited non-cash charges including purchase accounting and goodwill adjustments.  At December 31, 2022, the Company’s Interest Coverage Ratio was 19.0.
Leverage Ratio
- The Company’s ratio of funded debt to trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDA per the Credit Facility, calculated as Adjusted EBIT per the Credit Facility plus depreciation and amortization, may not exceed 3.5:1.  Under certain circumstances in connection with a Material Acquisition (as defined in the Facility), the Facility allows for the leverage ratio to go as high as 4.0:1 for a four-fiscal quarter period.  At December 31, 2022, the Company’s Leverage Ratio was 1.0.
As of December 31, 2022, we had borrowings under our facility of $187.5 million. In order to manage our interest rate exposure on these borrowings, we are party to $175.0 million of active floating to fixed rate swaps.  These swaps convert our interest payments from LIBOR to a weighted average fixed rate of 1.18%.  The effective rate of interest for our outstanding borrowings, including the impact of the interest rate swaps, was 2.47%.
In February 2023, subsequent to the end of the second quarter 2023, we renewed our five-year Amended and Restated Credit Agreement under terms similar to the existing Agreement, including a borrowing limit of $500 million, financial covenant limits similar to those described above, and the ability to increase the Agreement by an amount of up to $250 million, in accordance with specified conditions contained in the agreement.
36
Our primary cash requirements in addition to day-to-day operating needs include interest payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends.  Our primary sources of cash for these requirements are cash flows from continuing operations and borrowings under the facility.  We expect fiscal year 2023 capital spending to be approximately $30.0 million and $35.0 million which includes amounts not spent in fiscal year 2022.  We expect that fiscal year 2023 depreciation and amortization expense will be between $20.0 and $21.0 million and $7.0 and $9.0 million, respectively.

We sponsor a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans.  The U.S. pension plan is frozen for substantially all participants.  We have evaluated the current and long-term cash requirements of these plans, and our existing sources of liquidity are expected to be sufficient to cover required contributions under ERISA and other governing regulations.
The fair value of the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets was $141.3 million at December 31, 2022, as compared to $157.9 million at the most recent measurement date, which occurred as of June 30, 2022. The next measurement date to determine plan assets and benefit obligations will be on June 30, 2023.
The Company expects to pay $0.3 million in contributions to its defined benefit plans during the remainder of fiscal year 2023. Contributions of $0.1 million and $0.1 million were made during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There are no required contributions to the United States funded pension plan for fiscal year 2023.  The Company expects to make contributions during the remainder of fiscal year 2023 of $0.1 million and $0.2 million to its unfunded defined benefit plans in the U.S. and Germany, respectively.  Any subsequent plan contributions will depend on the results of future actuarial valuations.
We have an insurance program in place to fund supplemental retirement income benefits for three retired executives.  Current executives and new hires are not eligible for this program.  At December 31, 2022, the underlying policies had a cash surrender value of $11.3 million and are reported net of loans of $5.1 million for which we have the legal right of offset, these amounts are reported net on our balance sheet.

Other Matters
Inflation –
Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, occupancy costs, freight and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Inflation for medical costs can impact both our employee benefit costs as well as our reserves for workers' compensation claims. We monitor the inflationary rate and make adjustments to reserves whenever it is deemed necessary. Our ability to control worker compensation insurance medical cost inflation is dependent upon our ability to manage claims and purchase insurance coverage to limit the maximum exposure for us. Each of our segments is subject to the effects of changing raw material costs caused by the underlying commodity price movements. We have experienced price fluctuations for a number of materials including rhodium, steel, and other metal commodities. These materials are some of the key elements in the products manufactured in these segments.  Wherever possible, we will implement price increases to offset the impact of changing prices.  The ultimate acceptance of these price increases will be impacted by our affected divisions’ respective competitors and the timing of their price increases. In general, we do not enter into purchase contracts that extend beyond one operating cycle. While Standex considers our relationship with our suppliers to be good, there can be no assurances that we will not experience any supply shortage.
Foreign Currency Translation
– Our primary functional currencies used by our non-U.S. subsidiaries are the Euro, British Pound Sterling (Pound), Japanese (Yen), and Chinese (Yuan).
Defined Benefit Pension Plans  – We record expenses related to these plans based upon various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, mortality rates, and assumed rates of returns.  The Company’s pension plan is frozen for substantially all eligible U.S. employees and participants in the plan ceased accruing future benefits.
Environmental Matters
– To the best of our knowledge, we believe that we are presently in substantial compliance with all existing applicable environmental laws and regulations and do not anticipate any instances of non-compliance that will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Seasonality
– We are a diversified business with generally low levels of seasonality.
Employee Relations
– The Company has labor agreements with several union locals in the United States and several European employees belong to European trade unions.
Critical Accounting Policies
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Standex International Corporation and all of its subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.  Although we believe that materially different amounts would not be reported due to the accounting policies adopted, the application of certain accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022 lists a number of accounting policies which we believe to be the most critical.
38
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Risk Management
We are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates, commodity prices and changes in foreign currency exchange.  To reduce these risks, we selectively use, from time to time, financial instruments and other proactive management techniques.  We have internal policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of the Treasurer and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes only.  The use of financial instruments for trading purposes (except for certain investments in connection with the non-qualified defined contribution plan) or speculation is strictly prohibited.  The Company has no majority-owned subsidiaries that are excluded from the consolidated financial statements.  Further, we have no interests in or relationships with any special purpose entities.
Exchange Rate Risk
We are exposed to both transactional risk and translation risk associated with exchange rates.  The transactional risk is mitigated, in large part, by natural hedges developed with locally denominated debt service on intercompany accounts.  We also mitigate certain of our foreign currency exchange rate risks by entering into forward foreign currency contracts from time to time.  The contracts are used as a hedge against anticipated foreign cash flows, such as loan payments, customer remittances, and materials purchases, and are not used for trading or speculative purposes.  The fair values of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts.  However, any such losses or gains would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses, respectively, on the related hedged asset or liability.  At December 31, 2022 the fair value, in the aggregate, of the Company’s open foreign exchange contracts was a liability of $0.6 million.
Our primary translation risk is with the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Peso, Japanese Yen and Chinese Yuan.  A hypothetical 10% appreciation or depreciation of the value of any these foreign currencies to the U.S. Dollar at December 31, 2022, would not result in a material change in our operations, financial position, or cash flows.  We hedge our most significant foreign currency translation risks primarily through cross currency swaps and other instruments, as appropriate.
Interest Rate Risk
The Company’s effective interest rate on borrowings was 2.47% at December 31, 2022.  Our interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on our variable rate borrowings and is mitigated by our use of interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements.  At December 31, 2022, we have $175.0 million of active floating to fixed rate swaps with terms ranging from one to four years.  These swaps convert our interest payments from LIBOR to a weighted average rate of 1.18%.  At December 31, 2022 the fair value, in the aggregate, of the Company’s interest rate swaps was assets of $11.6 million. A 25-basis point increase in interest rates would not materially change our annual interest expense as most of our outstanding debt is currently converted to fixed rate debts by means of interest rate swaps.
Concentration of Credit Risk
We have a diversified customer base. As such, the risk associated with concentration of credit risk is inherently minimized. As of December 31, 2022, no one customer accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated outstanding receivables or of our sales.
Commodity Prices
The Company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for all commodities used in its manufacturing processes.  Each of our segments is subject to the effects of changing raw material costs caused by the underlying commodity price movements.  In general, we do not enter into purchase contracts that extend beyond one operating cycle.  While Standex considers our relationship with our suppliers to be good, there can be no assurances that we will not experience any supply shortage.
The Engineering Technologies, Specialty Solutions, and Electronics segments are all sensitive to price increases for steel and aluminum products, other metal commodities such as rhodium and copper, and petroleum-based products.  We have experienced price fluctuations for a number of materials including rhodium, steel, and other metal commodities.  These materials are some of the key elements in the products manufactured in these segments.  Wherever possible, we will implement price increases to offset the impact of changing prices.  The ultimate acceptance of these price increases, if implemented, will be impacted by our affected divisions’ respective competitors and the timing of their price increases.

ITEM 4.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
At the end of the period covered by this Report, the management of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”)). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
December 31, 2022
in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended
December 31, 2022
that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

The Company has a Stock Buyback Program (the “Program”) which was originally announced on January 30, 1985 and most recently amended on April 28, 2022. Under the Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to an aggregate of $200 million of its shares. Under the program, purchases may be made from time to time on the open market, including through 10b5-1 trading plans, or through privately negotiated transactions, block transactions, or other techniques in accordance with prevailing market conditions and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Board’s authorization is open-ended and does not establish a timeframe for the purchases. The Company is not obligated to acquire a particular number of shares, and the program may be discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion.
ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On February 2, 2023, Standex International Corporation entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Credit Facility”) with each of the lenders named therein as Lenders, including Citizens Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender, an L/C issuer, joint lead arranger, joint book runner and multicurrency administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., as co-syndication agent, joint lead arranger and joint book runner, TD Bank, N.A., as co-syndication agent and joint lead arranger, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as co-documentation agent, and Branch Banking & Trust Company, as co-documentation agent.
This Credit Facility has a borrowing limit of $500 million with an “accordion” feature under which the borrowing limit can be increased by agreement between the Company and the Lenders by an amount of up to $250 million, in accordance with specified conditions contained in the agreement. The facility also includes a $10 million sublimit for swing line loans, a $50 million sublimit for multicurrency loans and a $35 million sublimit for letters of credit. The Credit Facility amends and restates an existing $500 million revolving credit agreement (which contained a $250 million “accordion” feature), which was scheduled to expire on December 21, 2023. Funds borrowed under the new credit facility may be used for the repayment of debt, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions (so long as certain conditions, including a specified funded debt to EBITDA leverage ratio is maintained), and other general corporate purposes.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will pay a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee on available, but unused, amounts under the facility. The amount of the commitment fee will depend upon both the undrawn amount remaining available under the facility and the Company’s funded debt to EBITDA ratio as measured quarterly. As the Company’s funded debt to EBITDA ratio increases, the variable rate charged will increase. Amounts borrowed under the facility may be in the form of either Alternate Base Rate or Term SOFR loans. The rate of interest on Alternate Base Rate loans shall be the higher of (i) the Federal Funds rate plus ½ of 1%, (ii) the “prime rate” announced by Citizens Bank, N. A. or (iii) the daily SOFR Rate on such day plus 1%, plus an additional amount based upon the Company’s debt to EBITDA ratio. The rate of interest on SOFR Rate loans shall be the Term SOFR Reference Rate plus 0.1% rate which corresponds to the interest period (either one, two, three or six months) selected by the Company, plus an additional amount based upon the Company’s funded debt to EBITDA ratio. Swing Line loans shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate, plus an additional amount based upon the Company’s funded debt to EBITDA ratio. As the Company’s funded debt to EBITDA ratio increases, the additional amount will also increase.
The Credit Agreement expires on February 2, 2028, and contains customary representations, warranties and restrictive covenants, which include maintaining a funded debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of no greater than 3.50 to 1.00 (with a limited exception for a ratio of no greater than 4.00 to 1.00 for the four calendar quarters following a Material Permitted Acquisition as that term is defined in the Credit Agreement), and an EBIT to interest expense interest coverage ratio of no less than 2.75 to 1.00. The representations, warranties and restrictive covenants are otherwise substantially similar to those contained in the existing agreement. The Credit Facility also provides broader latitude to the Company with respect to foreign acquisitions and the incurrence of additional debt. The Credit Facility also allows the Company to borrow funds in other currencies including Pounds Sterling, Euros, and Canadian Dollars.
Many of the banks that are a party to the Credit Facility or their affiliates have in the past performed, and may in the future from time to time perform, investment banking, financial advisory, lending and/or commercial banking services for the Company and certain of the subsidiaries and affiliates, for which service they have in the past received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation and reimbursement expenses.
ITEM 2.03 CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT
The disclosure provided in Item 1.01 above is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03. The Credit Facility contains standard provisions relating to a default and acceleration of the Company’s payment obligations thereunder upon the occurrence of an event of default, which includes, among other things, the failure to pay principal, interest, fees or other amounts payable under the agreement when due; cross-default with other indebtedness; failure to comply with specified agreements, covenants or obligations; the making of any material misleading or untrue representation, warranty or certification; commencement of bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings by or against the Company; entry of one or more judgments against the Company that exceed $10 million, either individually or in the aggregate, unless covered by insurance; or the occurrence of certain events under Company-sponsored pension plans which could result in liability to the Company under Title IV of ERISA in excess of $10 million.
