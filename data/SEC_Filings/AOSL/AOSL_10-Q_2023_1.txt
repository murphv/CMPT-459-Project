The Company and Significant Accounting Policies The Company Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Company”, “AOS”, “we” or “us”) design, develop and supply a broad range of power semiconductors.
The Company's portfolio of products targets high-volume applications, including personal and portable computers, graphic cards, flat panel TVs, home appliances, smart phones, battery packs, quick chargers, home appliances, consumer and industrial motor controls and power supplies for TVs, computers, servers and telecommunications equipment.
The Company conducts its operations primarily in the United States of America (“USA”), Hong Kong, China, and South Korea. Basis of Preparation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X, as amended.
They do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.
These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods presented have been included in the interim periods.
Operating results for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023 or any other interim period.
The consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2022 is derived from the audited financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Reclassification The Company has reclassified certain amounts previously reported in its financial statements to conform to the current presentation.
See Note 11. Joint Venture On March 29, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture contract (the “JV Agreement”) with two investment funds owned by the Municipality of Chongqing (the “Chongqing Funds”), pursuant to which the Company and the Chongqing Funds formed a joint venture, (the “JV Company”), for the purpose of constructing and operating a power semiconductor packaging, testing and 12-inch wafer fabrication facility in the Liangjiang New Area of Chongqing, China (the “JV Transaction”).
As of December 1, 2021, the Company owned
50.9 %, and the Chongqing Funds owned
49.1 %, of the equity interest in the JV Company.
The Joint Venture was accounted under the provisions of the consolidation guidance since the Company had controlling financial interest until December 1, 2021.
As of December 2, 2021, the Company ceased having control over the JV Company.
Therefore, the Company deconsolidated the JV Company as of that date.
Subsequently, the Company has accounted for its investment in the JV Company using the equity method of accounting.
As of December 31, 2022, the percentage of outstanding JV equity interest beneficially owned by the Company was reduced to
42.2 %.
Such reduction reflects (i) the sale by the Company of approximately
2.1 % of the outstanding JV equity interest which resulted in the deconsolidation of the JV Company, (ii) additional sale by the Company of approximately
1.1 % of outstanding JV equity interest in December 2021, (iii) the adoption of an employee equity incentive plan and the issuance of additional equity interest equivalent to
3.99 %of the JV Company to investors in exchange for cash in December 2021, and (iv) issuance of additional equity interest of JV to investors in January 2022. Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties Related to Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”)
During the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic from 2019 to 2021, consumer behaviors changed due to various government restrictions that accelerated the growth of remote-working options by employers.
As a result, the Company experienced an increasing demand in markets for notebooks, personal computing ("PC"), gaming devices and other products,
8 ALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited) and the Company benefited from the increased demand for PC related products.
During the first half of calendar year 2022, COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rate continued to decline and governments in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and Europe, have lifted various restrictions and limitations on economic activities.
At the same time, new variants of COVID-19 continued to emerge and contributed to recent rise of infection rates in various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including China and U.S.
Also, the Company was affected by certain global impacts resulting from the pandemic, including disruption of the product supply chains, shortages of semiconductor components, and delays in shipments, product development, and product launches and rising inflation rates.
In addition, during the first half of calendar year 2022, the Company's operations were negatively impacted by China’s zero-Covid policy that resulted in factory shutdowns and supply chain shortages, including the temporary suspension of its factory operations in Shanghai from April to June 2022.
In December 2022, the Chinese government issued new guidelines easing some of its strict zero-COVID policies, including the relaxation of testing requirements and travel restrictions.
However, the change of COVID-policy and reopening of commercial activities resulted in a significant increase of COVID infections in China, which may adversely affect the Company’s operations in China. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements will be affected. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the estimates, judgments and assumptions including those related to stock rotation returns, price adjustments, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, warranty accrual, income taxes, leases, share-based compensation, recoverability of and useful lives for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Leases The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, current operating lease liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, finance lease liabilities and long-term finance leases liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The Company uses an estimate of its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The operating lease ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. Operating lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included within the operating lease ROU asset and lease liability calculation. The Company does not record leases on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet with a term of one year or less. The Company elected to combine its lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all asset classes. Revenue recognition The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied. The Company recognizes product revenue at a point in time when product is shipped to the customer, net of estimated stock rotation returns and price adjustments that it expects to provide to certain distributors. The Company presents revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments. Our standard payment terms range from 30 to 60 days. The Company sells its products primarily to distributors, who in turn sell the products globally to various end customers. The Company allows stock rotation returns from certain distributors.
Stock rotation returns are governed by contract and are limited to a specified percentage of the monetary value of products purchased by distributors during a specified period.
The Company records an allowance for stock rotation returns based on historical returns and individual distributor agreements.
The Company also provides special pricing to certain distributors, primarily based on volume, to encourage resale of the Company’s products.
Allowance for price adjustments is recorded against accounts receivable and the provision for stock rotation rights is included in accrued liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 9 ALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited) The Company’s performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient provided in ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. Therefore, the Company is not required to disclose the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period. The Company recognizes the incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract, which consist of sales commissions, when control over the products they relate to transfers to the customer. Applying the practical expedient, the Company recognizes commissions as expense when incurred, as the amortization period of the commission asset the Company would have otherwise recognized is less than one year. Packaging and testing services revenue is recognized at a point in time upon shipment of serviced products to the customer.
Share-based Compensation Expense The Company maintains an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan to grant restricted share units and stock options. The Company recognizes expense related to share-based compensation awards that are ultimately expected to vest based on estimated fair values on the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units is based on the fair value of the Company's common share on the date of grant. For restricted stock awards subject to market conditions, the fair value of each restricted stock award is estimated at the date of grant using the Monte-Carlo pricing model. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on the accelerated attribution basis over the requisite service period of the award, which generally equals the vesting period.
The Employee Share Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) is accounted for at fair value on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Restricted Cash The Company maintains restricted cash in connection with cash balances temporarily restricted for regular business operations.
These balances have been excluded from the Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance and are classified as restricted cash in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the amount of restricted cash was $ 0.3  million and $ 0.3  million, respectively.
Equity method investment The Company uses the equity method of accounting when it has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, over the operating and financial policies of the investee.
Effective December 2, 2021, the Company reduced its equity interest in the JV Company and experienced a loss of control of the JV Company.
As a result, beginning December 2, 2021, the Company records its investment under equity method of accounting.
Since the Company is unable to obtain accurate financial information from the JV Company in a timely manner, the Company records its share of earnings or losses of such affiliate on a one quarter lag.
The Company discloses and recognizes intervening events at the JV Company in the lag period that could materially affect our consolidated financial statements, if applicable.
The Company records its interest in the net earnings of the equity method investee, along with adjustments for unrealized profits or losses on intra-entity transactions and amortization of basis differences, within earnings or loss from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Profits or losses related to intra-entity sales with the equity method investee are eliminated until realized by the investor and investee.
Basis differences represent differences between the cost of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investment and are generally amortized over the lives of the related assets that gave rise to them.
Equity method goodwill is not amortized or tested for impairment; instead the equity method investment is tested for impairment.
The Company reviews for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable.
In such a case, the decrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Valuation of inventories The Company carries inventories at the lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Cost primarily consists of semiconductor wafers and raw materials, labor, depreciation expenses and other manufacturing expenses and overhead, and packaging and testing fees paid to third parties if subcontractors are used.
Valuation of inventories is based on its periodic review of inventory quantities on hand as compared with its sales forecasts, historical usage, aging of
10 ALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited) inventories, production yield levels and current product selling prices.
If actual market conditions are less favorable than those forecasted by the Company, additional future inventory write-downs may be required that could adversely affect its operating results.
Adjustments to inventory, once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped.
If actual market conditions are more favorable than expected and the products that have previously been written down are sold, our gross margin would be favorably impacted.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value of cash equivalents is categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
Cash equivalents consist primarily of short-term bank deposits.
The carrying values of financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values due to their short-term maturities.
The carrying value of the Company's debt is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value which is estimated by considering the current rates available to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities, structure, credit risk and terms of the debts. Government Grants The Company occasionally receives government grants that provide financial assistance for certain eligible expenditures in China.
These grants include reimbursements on interest expense on bank borrowings, payroll tax credits, credit for property, plant and equipment in a particular geographical location, employment credits, as well as business expansion credits.
Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attaching to it, and that the grant will be received.
The Company records such grants either as a reduction of the related expense, a reduction of the cost of the related asset, or as other income depending upon the nature of the grant.
As a result of such grants, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company reduced property, plant and equipment by $ 0.3  million and $ 0.6  million, and operating expenses by $ 0.1  million and $ 0.1  million, respectively.
During the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company reduced interest expense by $ 0.9  million and $ 0.9  million, property, plant and equipment by $ 0.1  million and $ 1.2  million, and operating expenses by $ 0.2  million and $ 0.2  million, respectively. Accounting for income taxes
Income tax expense or benefit is based on income or loss before income taxes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. The Company is subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions.
Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The Company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies based on estimates of whether additional taxes may be due.
While the final tax outcome of these matters may differ from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part.
When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or research and development tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized.
The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable.
The Company considers evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), issued guidance which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized.
The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met
11 ALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited) those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management.
If the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated, a material impact on income tax expense could result. The Company's provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by changes in earnings or tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions.
The Company is subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
The provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes to reserves, as well as the related net interest and penalties. Long-lived Assets The Company reviews all long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that these assets may not be recoverable.
When evaluating long-lived assets, if the Company concludes that the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values, which could adversely affect its results of operations. Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.
The Company's accumulated other comprehensive income consists of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments.
Total comprehensive income is presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements      Recently Issued Accounting Standards not yet adopted
In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-04, "Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations".
This ASU was issued in response to requests from financial statement users for increased transparency surrounding the use of supplier finance programs.
The amendments in ASU 2022-04 require that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude.
The amendments in this ASU do not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In November 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance.
This ASU requires business entities to make annual disclosures about transactions with a government they account for by analogizing to a grant or contribution accounting model under ASC 958-605.
The adoption of ASU 2021-10 had no impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, which, among other things, provides guidance on how to account for contracts on an entity’s own equity. This ASU simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity.
Specifically, the ASU eliminated the need for the Company to assess whether a contract on the entity’s own equity (1) permits settlement in unregistered shares, (2) whether counterparty rights rank higher than shareholder’s rights, and (3) whether collateral is required.
In addition, the ASU requires incremental disclosure related to contracts on the entity’s own equity and clarifies the treatment of certain financial instruments accounted for under this ASU on earnings per share.
The adoption of ASU 2020-06 had no impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 12 ALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Equity Method Investment in Equity Investee On December 1, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), Alpha & Omega Semiconductor (Shanghai) Ltd. (“AOS SH”) and Agape Package Manufacturing (Shanghai) Limited (“APM SH” and, together with AOS SH, the “Sellers”), each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a share transfer agreement ("STA") with a third-party investor to sell a portion of the Company's equity interest in the JV Company which consists of a power semiconductor packaging, testing and 12-inch wafer fabrication facility in Chongqing, China (the “Transaction”).
The Transaction closed on December 2, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), which reduced the Company’s equity interest in the JV Company from
50.9 % to
48.8 %.
Also, the Company’s right to designate directors on the board of JV Company was reduced to
three
(3) out of
seven
(7) directors, from
four
(4) directors prior to the Transaction.
As a result of the Transaction and other factors, the Company no longer has a controlling financial interest in the JV Company and has determined that the JV Company was deconsolidated from the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements effective as of the Closing Date.
On December 24, 2021, the Company entered into a share transfer agreement with another third-party investor, pursuant to which the Company sold to this investor
1.1 % of outstanding equity interest held by the Company in the JV Company.
In addition, the JV Company adopted an employee equity incentive plan and issued an equity interest equivalent to
3.99 % of the JV Company in exchange to cash.
As a result of these two transactions, the Company owned
45.8 % of the equity interest in the JV Company as of December 31, 2021.
On January 26, 2022, the JV Company completed a financing transaction pursuant to a corporate investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) between the JV Company and certain third-party investors (the “New Investors”).
Under the Investment Agreement, the New Investors purchased newly issued equity interest of the JV Company, representing approximately
7.82 % of post-transaction outstanding equity interests of the JV Company, for a total purchase price of RMB
509  million (or approximately USD
80  million based on the currency exchange rate as of January 26, 2022) (the “Investment”).
Following the closing of the Investment and as of June 30, 2022, the percentage of outstanding JV equity interest beneficially owned by the Company was reduced to
42.2 %. The Company accounts for its investment in the JV Company as an equity method investment and reports its equity in earnings or loss of the JV Company on a three-month lag due to an inability to timely obtain financial information of the JV Company.
During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $ 0.5  million and $ 3.0  million of its equity in income of the JV Company, respectively, using lag reporting.
As of December 31, 2022, the percentage of outstanding JV equity interest beneficially owned by the Company was
42.2 %. 13 ALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers
The Company manages its credit risk associated with exposure to distributors and direct customers on outstanding accounts receivable through the application and review of credit approvals, credit ratings and other monitoring procedures.
In some instances, the Company also obtains letters of credit from certain customers.
Credit sales, which are mainly on credit terms of
30
to
60
days, are only made to customers who meet the Company's credit requirements, while sales to new customers or customers with low credit ratings are usually made on an advance payment basis.
The Company considers its trade accounts receivable to be of good credit quality because its key distributors and direct customers have long-standing business relationships with the Company and the Company has not experienced any significant bad debt write-offs of accounts receivable in the past.
The Company closely monitors the aging of accounts receivable from its distributors and direct customers, and regularly reviews their financial positions, where available. Summarized below are individual customers whose revenue or accounts receivable balances were 10% or higher than the respective total consolidated amounts: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, Percentage of revenue 2022 2021 2022 2021 Customer A 19.8   % 22.8   % 22.0   % 25.1   % Customer B 36.7   % 40.7   % 37.7   % 38.7   % Customer C 14.6   % * 12.8   % *   December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Percentage of accounts receivable Customer A 23.1   % 24.6   % Customer B 27.7   % 36.4   % Customer C 18.9   % 12.0   % * Less than 10% 16 ALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Leases
The Company evaluates contracts for lease accounting at contract inception and assesses lease classification at the lease commencement date.
Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities - long-term on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, finance lease liabilities and finance lease liabilities-long-term on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company recognizes a ROU asset and corresponding lease obligation liability at the lease commencement date where the lease obligation liability is measured at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement.
The Company uses an interest rate commensurate with the interest rate to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term with an amount equal to the lease payments.
Operating leases are primarily related to offices, research and development facilities, sales and marketing facilities, and manufacturing facilities.
In addition, long-term supply agreements to lease gas tank equipment and purchase industrial gases are accounted for as operating leases.
Lease agreements frequently include renewal provisions and require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs.
For operating leases, the amortization of the ROU asset and the accretion of its lease obligation liability result in a single straight-line expense recognized over the lease term.
The finance lease is related to the $ 5.1  million of a machinery lease financing with a vendor.
In September 2022, the lease was amended to make a monthly payment of principal and interest as a fixed amount effective in October 2022.
Other terms remain the same.
The amendment was accounted for as a debt modification and no gain or loss was recognized.
In addition, the finance lease related to the RMB

Shareholders' Equity and Share-based Compensation
Share Repurchase In September 2017, the Board of Directors approved a repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”) that allowed the Company to repurchase its common shares from the open market pursuant to a pre-established Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or through privately negotiated transactions up to an aggregate of $ 30.0
million.
The amount and timing of any repurchases under the Repurchase Program depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to, the trading price, volume and availability of the Company’s common shares.
Shares repurchased under this program are accounted for as treasury shares and the total cost of shares repurchased is recorded as a reduction of shareholders' equity.
From time to time, treasury shares may be reissued as part of the Company’s share-based compensation programs.
Gains on re-issuance of treasury stock are credited to additional paid-in capital; losses are charged to additional paid-in capital to offset the net gains, if any, from previous sales or re-issuance of treasury stock.
Any remaining balance of the losses is charged to retained earnings. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did
no t repurchase any shares pursuant to the Repurchase Program.
Since the inception of the program, the Company repurchased an aggregate of
6,784,648
shares for a total cost of $ 67.3
million, at an average price of $ 9.92
per share, excluding fees and related expenses.
No
repurchased shares have been retired.
Of the
6,784,648
repurchased shares,
168,645
shares with a weighted average repurchase price of $ 10.05
per share, were reissued at an average price of $ 4.96
per share pursuant to option exercises and vested restricted share units (“RSU”).
As of December 31, 2022, approximately $ 13.4

1.0  million market-based restricted stock units ("MSUs") to its certain personnel.
The number of shares to be earned at the end of performance period is determined based on the Company’s achievement of specified stock prices and revenue thresholds during the performance period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024 as well as the recipients remaining in continuous service with the Company through such period.
The MSU vests in four equal annual installments after the end of performance period.

(Unaudited) Share-based Compensation Expense
On September 8, 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Board approved modifications to the terms of equity awards granted to a former officer who was a board member of the Company.
The modifications waived the four-year time based service performance of his MSU and allowed continuing vesting of his TRSU and PRSU according to the original awards' vesting schedule after his termination as a board member.
The incremental expenses for these equity shares resulting from the modification were $ 3.9  million.

Income Taxes
The Company recognized income tax expense of approximately $ 1.7  million and $ 34.1  million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The income tax expense of $ 1.7  million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 included a $ 0.1  million discrete tax expense.
The income tax expense of $ 34.1  million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 included a $ 32.8  million discrete tax expense related to the Company’s $ 391.5  million of income from the sale of equity interest in a joint venture and the related deconsolidation gain as the Company switches from the consolidation method of accounting to the equity method of accounting related to this investment and no longer asserts permanent reinvestment related to the Company’s investment in the joint venture.
Excluding the discrete income tax items, the income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 1.6  million and $ 1.3  million, respectively, and the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was
20.2 % and
4.7 %, respectively.
Excluding the effects of the discrete tax expense recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the changes in the tax expense and effective tax rate between the periods resulted primarily from changes in the mix of earnings in various geographic jurisdictions between the current year and the same period of last year as well as from reporting pretax book income of $ 8.0  million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $ 27.6  million of pretax book income (excluding the $ 391.5  million of income from the sale of equity interest in a joint venture and the related deconsolidation gain) for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The Company recognized income tax expense of approximately $ 3.0  million and $ 35.4  million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Excluding the discrete income tax items, income tax expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 2.9  million and $ 2.5  million, respectively, and the effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was
8.2 % and
5.0 %, respectively.
Excluding the effects of the discrete tax expense recorded in the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the changes in the tax expense and effective tax rate between the periods resulted primarily from changes in the mix of earnings in various geographic jurisdictions between the current year and the same period of last year as well as from the Company reporting a pretax book income of $ 35.4  million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to pretax book income of $ 50.4  million of pretax book income (excluding the $ 391.5  million of income from the sale of equity interest in a joint venture and the related deconsolidation gain) for the six months ended December 31, 2021. 28 ALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited) The Company files its income tax returns in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions.
The tax years 2001 to 2022 remain open to examination by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
The tax years 2014 to 2022 remain open to examination by foreign tax authorities. The Company's income tax returns are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions.
In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes.
These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments.
As of December 31, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $ 8.7  million, of which $ 5.7  million, if recognized, would reduce the effective income tax rate in future periods.
If the Company's estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, then a further charge to expense would be required.
If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.
The Company does not anticipate any material changes to its uncertain tax positions during the next twelve months. “The Chip and Science Act of 2022”, Enacted August 2, 2022 In August 2022 the U.S. enacted the Chip and Science Act of 2022 (the Chips Act).
The Chips Act provides incentives to semiconductor chip manufacturers in the United States, including providing a 25% manufacturing investment credits for investments in semiconductor manufacturing property placed in service after December 31, 2022, for which construction begins before January 1, 2027.
Property investments qualify for the 25% credit if, among other requirements, the property is integral to the operation of an advanced manufacturing facility, defined as having a primary purpose of manufacturing semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing equipment.
Currently, we are evaluating the impact of the Chips Act to us. “The Inflation Reduction Act”, Enacted August 16, 2022 In August 2022 the United States enacted tax legislation through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
The IRA introduces a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) for corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) for any consecutive three-tax-year period preceding the applicable tax year exceeds $1 billion.
The CAMT is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022.
The CAMT is currently not applicable to the Company. Altera Litigation On July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
In the July 2015 ruling, the Tax Court concluded that the sharing of the cost of employee stock compensation in a company’s cost-sharing arrangement was invalid under the U.S. Administrative Procedures Act.
In June 2019, a panel of the Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals reversed this decision.
In July 2019, Altera petitioned U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to hold an en banc rehearing of the case.
The petition was subsequently denied by the Ninth Circuit.
Altera appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court in February 2020, but the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in June 2020, leaving intact the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s decision.
AOS has not recorded any benefit related to the Altera Corporation Tax Court decision in any period through December 2022.
The Company will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impact to its financial statements. 29 ALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Segment and Geographic Information
The Company is organized as, and operates in,
one
operating segment: the design, development and supply of power semiconductor products for computing, consumer electronics, communication and industrial applications.
The chief operating decision-maker is the Chief Executive Officer.
The financial information presented to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer is on a consolidated basis, accompanied by information about revenue by customer and geographic region, for purposes of evaluating financial performance and allocating resources.
The Company has
one
business segment, and there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results and plans for products or components below the consolidated unit level.
Accordingly, the Company reports as a single operating segment. The Company sells its products primarily to distributors in the Asia Pacific region, who in turn sell these products to end customers.
Because the Company’s distributors sell their products to end customers which may have a global presence, revenue by geographical location is not necessarily representative of the geographical distribution of sales to end user markets.
The revenue by geographical location in the following tables is based on the country or region in which the products were shipped to: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 (in thousands) (in thousands) Hong Kong $ 159,301   $ 159,189   $ 331,597   $ 307,844   China 15,730   27,235   43,744   60,075   South Korea 3,642   3,263   6,539   6,117   United States 7,972   3,165   12,456   5,470   Other countries 2,115   467   2,900   848     $ 188,760   $ 193,319   $ 397,236   $ 380,354   The following is a summary of revenue by product type: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021   (in thousands) (in thousands) Power discrete $ 137,582   $ 134,511   $ 282,155   $ 264,875   Power IC 49,972   55,557   112,292   108,211   Packaging and testing services 1,206   3,251   2,789   7,268     $ 188,760   $ 193,319   $ 397,236   $ 380,354   Long-lived assets, net consisting of property, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, net by geographical area are as follows:   December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 (in thousands) China $ 112,984   $ 105,326   United States 257,701   232,731   Other countries 3,739   4,283     $ 374,424   $ 342,340   30 ALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Commitments As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had approximately $ 77.2
million and $ 89.9
million, respectively, of outstanding purchase commitments primarily for purchases of semiconductor raw materials, wafers, spare parts, packaging and testing services and others. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had approximately $ 23.7
million and $ 63.4
million, respectively, of capital commitments for the purchase of property and equipment. Other Commitments          See Note 7 and Note 8 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for descriptions of commitments including bank borrowings and leases.
Contingencies and Indemnities
The Company has in the past, and may from time to time in the future, become involved in legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities.  The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation, including claims regarding patent and other intellectual property rights as well as improper hiring practices.
Irrespective of the validity of such claims, the Company could incur significant costs in the defense of such claims and suffer adverse effects on its operations.
In December 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) commenced an investigation into the Company's compliance with export control regulations relating to its business transactions with Huawei and its affiliates (“Huawei”), which were added to the “Entity List” maintained by the Department of Commerce (“DOC”) on May 16, 2019.  The Company is cooperating fully with federal authorities in the investigation, including responding to requests for documents, information and interviews from DOJ in connection with the investigation.
The Company has maintained an export control compliance program and has been committed to comply fully with all applicable laws and regulations.  In connection with this investigation, DOC requested the Company to suspend shipments of its products to Huawei, and the Company complied with such request, and the Company has not shipped any product to Huawei after December 31, 2019.  The Company is currently working with DOC to resolve this issue.  Given the case is in still ongoing and neither DOJ nor DOC have provided the Company with any clear indication of the timing and schedule for the investigation, the Company cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may occur.  Also, the Company is unable to predict the duration, scope, result or related costs of the investigation, although the Company expects to incur additional professional fees as a result of this matter.  In addition, the Company is unable to predict what, if any, further action that may be taken by the government in connection with the investigation, or what, if any, penalties, sanctions or remedial actions may be sought. The Company is a party to a variety of agreements that it has contracted with various third parties.
Pursuant to these agreements, the Company may be obligated to indemnify another party to such an agreement with respect to certain matters.
Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts entered into by the Company, under which the Company customarily agrees to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title to assets sold, certain intellectual property rights, specified environmental matters and certain income taxes.
In these circumstances, payment by the Company is customarily conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow the Company to challenge the other party's claim.
Further, the Company's obligations under these agreements may be limited in time and/or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by it under these agreements.
The Company has not historically paid or recorded any material indemnifications, and
no
accrual was made at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.
The Company has agreed to indemnify its directors and certain employees as permitted by law and pursuant to its Bye-laws, and has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers.
The Company has not recorded a liability associated with these indemnification arrangements, as it historically has not incurred any material costs associated with such indemnification obligations.
Costs associated with such indemnification obligations may be mitigated by insurance coverage that the Company maintains.
However, such insurance may not cover any, or may cover only a portion of, the amounts the Company may be required to pay.
In addition, the Company may not be able to maintain such insurance coverage at reasonable cost, if at all, in the future. 31 ALPHA AND OMEGA SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

45
days of the execution of the agreement, with the remaining amount to be paid upon our achievement of specified engineering services and product milestones. In addition, the Company also entered an accompanying supply agreement to provide limited wafer supply.
32 ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters addressed in this Item 2 constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
These forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding future financial performance of the Company; the expected ramp up timeline of the 12-inch fab at the JV Company; the impact of government investigation and coronavirus on our financial performance; and other statements and information set forth under the heading “Factors Affecting Our Performance”.
Such forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below under the heading “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the Company’s management. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) provides certain “safe harbor” provisions for forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made pursuant to the Act. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to its forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unexpected events. Unless the context otherwise requires, the words “AOS,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited and its subsidiaries. This management’s discussion should be read in conjunction with the management’s discussion included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 19, 2022. Overview We are a designer, developer and global supplier of a broad portfolio of power semiconductors. Our portfolio of power semiconductors includes approximately 2,500 products, and has grown significantly with the introduction of over 130 new products in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, and over 160 new products in each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we introduced an additional 37 new products.
Our teams of scientists and engineers have developed extensive intellectual property and technical knowledge that encompass major aspects of power semiconductors, which we believe enables us to introduce and develop innovative products to address the increasingly complex power requirements of advanced electronics.
We have an extensive patent portfolio that consists of 906 patents and 55 patent applications in the United States as of December 31, 2022.
We also have a total of 961 foreign patents, which were based primarily on our research and development efforts through December 31, 2022.
We differentiate ourselves by integrating our expertise in technology, design and advanced manufacturing and packaging to optimize product performance and cost. Our portfolio of products targets high-volume applications, including personal computers, graphic cards, game consoles, flat panel TVs, home appliances, power tools, smart phones, battery packs, consumer and industrial motor controls and power supplies for TVs, computers, servers and telecommunications equipment. Our business model leverages global resources, including research and development and manufacturing in the United States and Asia. Our sales and technical support teams are localized in several growing markets. We operate an 8-inch wafer fabrication facility located in Hillsboro, Oregon, or the Oregon Fab, which is critical for us to accelerate proprietary technology development, new product introduction and improve our financial performance. To meet the market demand for the more mature high volume products, we also utilize the wafer manufacturing capacity of selected third party foundries. For assembly and test, we primarily rely upon our in-house facilities in China. In addition, we utilize subcontracting partners for industry standard packages. We believe our in-house packaging and testing capability provides us with a competitive advantage in proprietary packaging technology, product quality, cost and sales cycle time. During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, we continued our product diversification program by developing new silicon and packaging platforms to expand our serviceable available market, or SAM and offer higher performance products.
Our metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, or MOSFET, and power IC product portfolio also expanded.
On March 29, 2016, we formed a joint venture (the “JV Company”) with two investment funds owned by the Municipality of Chongqing (the “Chongqing Funds”), for the purpose of constructing and operating a power semiconductor packaging, testing and 12-inch wafer fabrication facility (“Fab”) in the LiangJiang New Area of Chongqing, China.
The Fab is being built in phases.  As of December 1, 2021, we owned 50.9%, and the Chongqing Funds owned 49.1% of the equity interest in the JV Company.
The Joint Venture was accounted under the provisions of the consolidation guidance since we had controlling financial interest until December 1, 2021.
On December 1, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), Alpha & Omega Semiconductor (Shanghai) Ltd. (“AOS SH”) and Agape Package Manufacturing (Shanghai) Limited (“APM SH” and, together with AOS SH, the “Sellers”), each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a share transfer agreement ("STA") with a third-party investor to sell a portion of the
33 Company's equity interest in the JV Company which consists of a power semiconductor packaging, testing and 12-inch wafer fabrication facility in Chongqing, China (the “Transaction”). The Transaction closed on December 2, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), which reduced the Company’s equity interest in the JV Company from 50.9% to 48.8%.
Also, the Company’s right to designate directors on the board of JV Company was reduced to three (3) out of seven (7) directors, from four (4) directors prior to the Transaction.
As a result of the Transaction and other factors, the Company no longer has a controlling financial interest in the JV Company and has determined that the JV Company was deconsolidated from the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements effective as of the Closing Date. On December 24, 2021, the Company entered into a share transfer agreement with another third-party investor, pursuant to which the Company sold to this investor 1.1% of outstanding equity interest held by the Company in the JV Company.
In addition, the JV Company adopted an employee equity incentive plan and issued an equity interest equivalent to 3.99% of the JV Company in exchange for cash.
As a result of these two transactions, the Company owned 45.8% of the equity interest in the JV Company as of December 31, 2021. On January 26, 2022, the JV Company completed a financing transaction pursuant to a corporate investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) between the JV Company and certain third-party investors (the “New Investors”). Under the Investment Agreement, the New Investors purchased newly issued equity interest of the JV Company, representing approximately 7.82% of post-transaction outstanding equity interests of the JV Company, for a total purchase price of RMB 509 million (or approximately USD 80 million based on the currency exchange rate as of January 26, 2022) (the “Investment”). Following the closing of the January 26, 2022 Investment, the percentage of outstanding JV equity interest beneficially owned by the Company was reduced to 42.2% at both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. We reduced our ownership of the JV Company to below 50% to increase the flexibility of the JV Company to raise capital to fund its future expansion.
The JV Company is also contemplating an eventual listing on the Science and Technology Innovation Board, or STAR Market, of the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
The reduction of our ownership assists the JV Company in meeting certain regulatory listing requirements.
A potential STAR Market listing may take several years to consummate and there is no guarantee that such listing by the JV Company will be successful or will be completed in a timely manner, or at all.
In addition, the JV Company will continue to provide us with significant level of foundry capacity to enable us to develop and manufacture our products.
On July 12, 2022, the current shareholders of the JV Company entered into a shareholders contract, pursuant to which the JV Company provided us with a monthly wafer production capacity guarantee, subject to future increase when the JV Company’s production capacity reaches certain specified level. Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic to our Business
Our business operations have been impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn. Numerous governmental jurisdictions, including the States of California, Oregon and Texas in the U.S. and countries throughout the Asia Pacific region have imposed various restrictions on commercial activities, resulting in business closures, work stoppages, labor shortage, disruptions to ports, vaccine mandates and other shipping infrastructure, border closures, thereby negatively impacting our customers, suppliers, distributors, employees, offices, and the entire semiconductor ecosystem.
During the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic from 2019 to 2021, consumer behaviors changed due to various government restrictions that accelerated the growth of remote-working options by employers.
As a result, we experienced an increasing demand in markets for notebooks, personal computing ("PC"), gaming devices and other products, and we benefited from the increased demand for PC related products.
In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees and to comply with various government and regulatory guidelines, we also took proactive actions to adopt policies and protocols at our locations around the world, including social distancing guidelines, vaccine and testing protocols. During the first half of calendar year 2022, COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rate continued to decline and governments in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and Europe, have lifted various restrictions and limitations on economic activities.
At the same time, however, new variants of COVID-19 continued to emerge and contributed to recent rise of infection rates in various jurisdictions in which we operate, including China and U.S.
Also, we may be subject to the ongoing global impacts resulting from the pandemic, including disruption of the product supply chains, shortages of semiconductor components, and delays in shipments, product development, and product launches and rising inflation rates.
In addition, during the first half of calendar year 2022, our operations were negatively impacted by China’s zero-Covid policy that resulted in factory shutdowns and supply chain shortages, including the temporary suspension of our factory operations in Shanghai from April to June 2022. In December 2022, the Chinese government issued new guidelines easing some of its strict zero-COVID policies, including the relaxation of testing requirements and travel restrictions.
However, the change of COVID- 34 policy and reopening of commercial activities resulted in a significant increase of COVID infections in China.
While the rising infection rates affected some of our workers in our facilities in China, we are expecting the infection rate to stabilize or decrease over time and do not expect COVID pandemic in China or elsewhere will have a material impact on our business operations and financial results.
See “Other Factors affecting our performance—Manufacturing costs and capacity availability” As COVID-19 pandemic subsides, its impact on macroeconomic conditions continues, including supply chain disruptions and rising inflation rates.
Recently we have experienced inflationary pressures on our business in most jurisdictions where we operate, including higher wages and labor costs, increased pricing on raw materials and third party vendors, and rising costs of other goods and services that we need to purchase to develop our products and operate our facilities.
While we do not believe inflation has a material impact on our financial performance, we are taking measures to mitigate its impact, including but are not limited to, implementation of cost-saving programs and active search for competitive and alternative sources of goods and services.
There is no guarantee that these measures will be effective, particularly if rising inflation continues for an extended period of time. Other Factors affecting our performance The global, regional economic and PC market conditions : Because our products primarily serve consumer electronic applications, any significant change in global and regional economic conditions could materially affect our revenue and results of operations. A significant amount of our revenue is derived from sales of products in the PC markets, such as notebooks, motherboards and notebook battery packs, therefore a substantial decline or downturn in the PC market could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. The PC markets have experienced a modest global decline in recent years due to continued growth of demand in tablets and smart phones, worldwide economic conditions and the industry inventory correction which had and may continue to have a material impact on the demand for our products.
A decline of the PC market may have a negative impact on our revenue, factory utilization, gross margin, our ability to resell excess inventory, and other performance measures. We have executed and continue to execute strategies to diversify our product portfolio, penetrate other market segments, including the consumer, communications and industrial markets, and improve gross margins and profit by implementing cost control measures. While making efforts to reduce our reliance on the computing market, we continue to support our computing business and capitalize on the opportunities in this market with a more focused and competitive PC product strategy to gain market share. Manufacturing costs and capacity availability:
Our gross margin is affected by a number of factors including our manufacturing costs, utilization of our manufacturing facilities, the product mixes of our sales, pricing of wafers from third party foundries and pricing of semiconductor raw materials.
Capacity utilization affects our gross margin because we have certain fixed costs at our Shanghai facilities and our Oregon Fab.
If we are unable to utilize our manufacturing facilities at a desired level, our gross margin may be adversely affected.
In addition, from time to time, we may experience wafer capacity constraints, particularly at third party foundries, that may prevent us from meeting fully the demand of our customers. For example, the recent global shortage of semiconductor manufacturing capacity has provided us with both challenges and opportunities in the market, and highlighted the importance of maintaining sufficient and independent in-house manufacturing capabilities to meet increasing customer demands. While we can mitigate these constraints by increasing and re-allocating capacity at our own fab, we may not be able to do so quickly or at sufficient level, which could adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations. In addition, we recently commenced a plan to enhance the manufacturing capability and capacity of our Oregon Fab by investing in new equipment and expanding our factory facilities, which we expect will have a positive impact on our future new product development and revenue, particularly during the period of global shortage of capacity.
The expansion is expected to be completed in the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023.
We also rely substantially on the JV Company to provide foundry capacity to manufacture our products, therefore it is critical that we maintain continuous access to such capacity, which may not be available at sufficient level or at a pricing terms favorable to us because of lack of control over the JV Company’s operation.
As a result of sales of our JV Company equity interests and issuance of additional equity interests by the JV Company to third-party investors in financing transactions, our equity interest in the JV Company was reduced to 42.2%, which reduced our control and influence over the JV Company.
We continue to maintain a business relationship with the JV Company to ensure uninterrupted supply of manufacturing capacity.
On July 12, 2022, we entered into an agreement with the JV Company, pursuant to which the JV Company agrees to provide us with a monthly wafer production capacity guarantee, subject to future increase when the JV Company’s production capacity reaches certain specified level.
Because we continue to rely on the JV Company to provide us with manufacturing capacity, if the JV Company take actions or make decisions that prevents us from accessing required capacity, our operations may be adversely affected.
Erosion and fluctuation of average selling price:
Erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical in our industry. Consistent with this historical trend, we expect our average selling prices of existing products to decline in the future. However, in the normal course of business, we seek to offset the effect of declining average selling price by introducing new and higher value products, expanding existing products for new applications and new customers and reducing the manufacturing cost of existing products. These strategies may cause the average selling price of our products to fluctuate significantly from time to time, thereby affecting our financial performance and profitability. 35 Product introductions and customers’ product requirements:
Our success depends on our ability to introduce products on a timely basis that meet or are compatible with our customers' specifications and performance requirements. Both factors, timeliness of product introductions and conformance to customers' requirements, are equally important in securing design wins with our customers. As we accelerate the development of new technology platforms, we expect to increase the pace at which we introduce new products and seek and acquire design wins. If we were to fail to introduce new products on a timely basis that meet customers’ specifications and performance requirements, particularly those products with major OEM customers, and continue to expand our serviceable markets, then we would lose market share and our financial performance would be adversely affected.
Distributor ordering patterns, customer demand and seasonality:
Our distributors place purchase orders with us based on their forecasts of end customer demand, and this demand may vary significantly depending on the sales outlook and market and economic conditions of end customers. Because these forecasts may not be accurate, channel inventory held at our distributors may fluctuate significantly, which in turn may prompt distributors to make significant adjustments to their purchase orders placed with us. As a result, our revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, because our products are used in consumer electronics products, our revenue is subject to seasonality. Our sales seasonality is affected by numerous factors, including global and regional economic conditions as well as the PC market conditions, revenue generated from new products, changes in distributor ordering patterns in response to channel inventory adjustments and end customer demand for our products and fluctuations in consumer purchase patterns prior to major holiday seasons. In recent periods, broad fluctuations in the semiconductor markets and the global and regional economic conditions, in particular the decline of the PC market conditions, have had a more significant impact on our results of operations than seasonality. Furthermore, our revenue may be impacted by the level of demand from our major customers due to factors outside of our control. If these major customers experience significant decline in the demand of their products, encounter difficulties or defects in their products, or otherwise fail to execute their sales and marketing strategies successfully, it may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. Principal line items of statements of income The following describes the principal line items set forth in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income: Revenue We generate revenue primarily from the sale of power semiconductors, consisting of power discretes and power ICs. Historically, a majority of our revenue has been derived from power discrete products. Because our products typically have three-year to five-year life cycles, the rate of new product introduction is an important driver of revenue growth over time. We believe that expanding the breadth of our product portfolio is important to our business prospects, because it provides us with an opportunity to increase our total bill-of-materials within an electronic system and to address the power requirements of additional electronic systems. In addition, a small percentage of our total revenue is generated by providing packaging and testing services to third parties through one of our subsidiaries. Our product revenue is reported net of the effect of the estimated stock rotation returns and price adjustments that we expect to provide to our distributors. Stock rotation returns are governed by contract and are limited to a specified percentage of the monetary value of products purchased by the distributor during a specified period. At our discretion or upon our direct negotiations with the original design manufacturers (“ODMs”) or original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), we may elect to grant special pricing that is below the prices at which we sold our products to the distributors. In these situations, we will grant price adjustments to the distributors reflecting such special pricing. We estimate the price adjustments for inventory at the distributors based on factors such as distributor inventory levels, pre-approved future distributor selling prices, distributor margins and demand for our products. Cost of goods sold Our cost of goods sold primarily consists of costs associated with semiconductor wafers, packaging and testing, personnel, including share-based compensation expense, overhead attributable to manufacturing, operations and procurement, and costs associated with yield improvements, capacity utilization, warranty and valuation of inventories. As the volume of sales increases, we expect cost of goods sold to increase. While our utilization rates cannot be immune to the market conditions, our goal is to make them less vulnerable to market fluctuations. We believe our market diversification strategy and product growth will drive higher volume of manufacturing which will improve our factory utilization rates and gross margin in the long run. Operating expenses 36 Our operating expenses consist of research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. We expect our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate from period to period as we continue to exercise cost control measures in response to the declining PC market as well as align our operating expenses to the revenue level. Research and development expenses .
Our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with new product prototypes, travel expenses, fees for engineering services provided by outside contractors and consultants, amortization of software and design tools, depreciation of equipment and overhead costs. We continue to invest in developing new technologies and products utilizing our own fabrication and packaging facilities as it is critical to our long-term success. We also evaluate appropriate investment levels and stay focused on new product introductions to improve our competitiveness. We expect that our research and development expenses will fluctuate from time to time. Selling, general and administrative expenses.
Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation expense, product promotion costs, occupancy costs, travel expenses, expenses related to sales and marketing activities, amortization of software, depreciation of equipment, maintenance costs and other expenses for general and administrative functions as well as costs for outside professional services, including legal, audit and accounting services. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to fluctuate in the near future as we continue to exercise cost control measures. Income tax expense
We are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions.
Significant judgment and estimates are required in determining our worldwide income tax expense.
The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations of different jurisdictions globally.
We establish accruals for potential liabilities and contingencies based on a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of uncertain tax positions.
If the recognition threshold is met, the applicable accounting guidance permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority.
If the actual tax outcome of such exposures is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, the differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Changes in the location of taxable income (loss) could result in significant changes in our income tax expense. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on historical profitability and our estimate of future taxable income in a particular jurisdiction.
Our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws, tax planning strategies or other factors.
If our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the deferred tax assets may increase or decrease, resulting in corresponding changes in income tax expense.
Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide profits or losses, the tax laws and regulations in each geographical region where we have operations, the availability of tax credits and carry-forwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. “The Chip and Science Act of 2022”, Enacted August 2, 2022 In August 2022 the U.S. enacted the Chip and Science Act of 2022 (the Chips Act).
The Chips Act provides incentives to semiconductor chip manufacturers in the United States, including providing a 25% manufacturing investment credits for investments in semiconductor manufacturing property placed in service after December 31, 2022, for which construction begins before January 1, 2027.
Property investments qualify for the 25% credit if, among other requirements, the property is integral to the operation of an advanced manufacturing facility, defined as having a primary purpose of manufacturing semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing equipment.
Currently, we are evaluating the impact of the Chips Act to us. “The Inflation Reduction Act”, Enacted August 16, 2022 In August 2022 the United States enacted tax legislation through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
The IRA introduces a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) for corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) for any consecutive three-tax-year period preceding the applicable tax year exceeds $1 billion.
The CAMT is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022.
The CAMT is currently not applicable to the Company. 37 Altera Litigation On July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
In the July 2015 ruling, the Tax Court concluded that the sharing of the cost of employee stock compensation in a company’s cost-sharing arrangement was invalid under the U.S. Administrative Procedures Act.
In June 2019, a panel of the Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals reversed this decision.
In July 2019, Altera petitioned U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to hold an en banc rehearing of the case.
The petition was subsequently denied by the Ninth Circuit.
Altera appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court in February 2020, but the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in June 2020, leaving intact the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s decision.

We use the equity method of accounting when we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but we do not have control, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, over the operating and financial policies of the company.
Effective December 2, 2021, we reduced our equity interest in the JV Company below 50% of outstanding equity ownership and experienced a loss of control of the JV Company.
As a result, we record our investment under equity method of accounting.
Since we are unable to obtain accurate financial information from the JV Company in a timely manner, we record our share of earnings or losses of such affiliate on a one quarter lag.
We record our interest in the net earnings of the equity method investee, along with adjustments for unrealized profits or losses on intra-entity transactions and amortization of basis differences, within earnings or loss from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Profits or losses related to intra-entity sales with the equity method investee are eliminated until realized by the investor or investee.
Basis differences represent differences between the cost of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investment and are generally amortized over the lives of the related assets that gave rise to them.
Equity method goodwill is not amortized or tested for impairment.
Instead the total equity method investment balance, including equity method goodwill, is tested for impairment.
We review for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable.
In such a case, the decrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Results of Operations

Excluding the effects of the discrete tax expense recorded in the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the changes in the tax expense and effective tax rate between the periods resulted primarily from changes in the mix of earnings in various geographic jurisdictions between the current year and the same period of last year as well as from the Company reporting a pretax book income of $35.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to pretax book income of $50.4 million of pretax book income (excluding the $391.5 million of income from the sale of equity interest in a joint venture and the related deconsolidation gain) for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The Company files its income tax returns in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions.
The tax years 2001 to 2022 remain open to examination by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.
The tax years 2014 to 2022 remain open to examination by foreign tax authorities. 43 The Company's income tax returns are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions.
In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes.
These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments.
As of December 31, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $8.7 million, of which $5.7 million, if recognized, would reduce the effective income tax rate in future periods.
If the Company's estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, then a further charge to expense would be required.
If the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.
The Company does not anticipate any material changes to its uncertain tax positions during the next twelve months. Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal need for liquidity and capital resources is to maintain sufficient working capital to support our operations and to invest adequate capital expenditures to grow our business. To date, we finance our operations and capital expenditures primarily through funds generated from operations and borrowings under our term loans, financing lease and other debt agreements. On February 6, 2023, we entered into a license and engineering service agreement with a leading power semiconductor automotive supplier related to our Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFET and diode technology.

The purpose of the credit facility was to provide short-term borrowings.
The Company could borrow up to approximately RMB 72.0 million or $10.3 million based on currency exchange rate between RMB and U.S. Dollar on November 16, 2018.
The RMB 72.0 million consists of RMB 27.0 million for trade borrowings with a maturity date of December 31, 2021,
and RMB 45.0 million for working capital borrowings or trade borrowings with a maturity date of September 13, 2022.
During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company borrowed RMB 5.0 million, or $0.8 million, at an interest rate of 3.7% per annum, with principal due on September 12, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, there was no out standin g balance and this loan was expired. On May 1, 2018, Jireh entered into a loan agreement with the Bank that provided a term loan in the amount of $17.8 million.
The obligation under the loan agreement is secured by certain real estate assets of Jireh and guaranteed by the Company.  The loan has a five-year term and matures on June 1, 2023.
Beginning June 1, 2018, Jireh made consecutive monthly payments of principal and interest to the Bank.
The outstanding principal accrues interest at a fixed rate of 5.04% per annum on the basis of a 360-day year.
The loan agreement contains customary restrictive covenants and includes certain financial covenants that require the Company to maintain, on a consolidated basis, specified financial ratios.
In August 2021, Jireh signed an amendment of this loan with the Bank to modify the financial covenants requirement to align with the new term loan agreement entered into on August 18, 2021 discussed above.
The amendment was accounted for as a debt modification and no gain or loss was recognized. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of the term loa n
was $13.7 million. On August 15, 2017, Jireh entered into a credit agreement with the Bank that provided a term loan in an amount up to $30.0 million for the purpose of purchasing certain equipment for the Company’s fabrication facility located in Oregon.  The obligation under the credit agreement is secured by substantially all assets of Jireh and guaranteed by the Company.  The credit agreement has a five-year term and matured on August 15, 2022.
In January 2018 and July 2018, Jireh drew down the loan in the amount of $13.2 million and $16.7 million, respectively.
Beginning in October 2018, Jireh is required to pay to the Bank on each payment date, the outstanding principal amount of the loan in monthly installments.  The loan accrues interest based on an adjusted LIBOR as defined in the credit agreement, plus a specified applicable margin in the range of 1.75% to 2.25%, based on the outstanding balance of the loan.  The credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants and includes certain financial covenants that require the Company to maintain, on a consolidated basis, specified financial ratios and fixed charge coverage ratio.
In August 2021, Jireh signed an amendment of this loan with the Bank to modify the financial covenants requirement to align with the new term loan agreement entered into on August 18, 2021, discussed above.
The amendment was accounted for as a debt modification and no gain or loss was recognized.
The loan was paid in full in September 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, there was 0 outstanding balance. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including working capital and capital expenditures, for at least the next twelve months.
In addition, we commenced an investment plan to expand the manufacturing capacity and upgrade the operational capabilities of our Oregon Fab.
We intend to fund the costs by a combination of cash reserve, bank loans and equipment leases.
In the long-term, we may require additional capital due to changing business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue.
If our cash is insufficient to meet our needs, we may seek to raise capital through equity or debt financing.
The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders.
The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and may include operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations.
We cannot be certain that any financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 45 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we h a d $288.1 million and $314.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, respectively.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Management's Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”)), as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022 have been designed and are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the six months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. 48 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
As previously disclosed, the DOJ commenced an investigation into the Company’s compliance with export control regulations relating to its business transactions with Huawei and its affiliates (“Huawei”), which were added to the “Entity List” by the DOC in May 2019.
The Company is cooperating fully with federal authorities in the investigation.
The Company has continued to respond to inquiries and requests from DOJ for documents and information relating to the investigation, and the matter is currently pending at DOJ, and DOJ has not provided the Company with any specific timeline or indication as to when the investigation will be concluded or resolved.
In connection with this investigation, DOC previously requested the Company to suspend shipments of its products to Huawei.
The Company complied with such request, and the Company has not shipped any product to Huawei after December 31, 2019.
The Company continues to work with DOC to resolve this issue and requested DOC to grant permission to reinstate the Company’s shipments to Huawei.
As part of this process and in response to DOC’s request, the Company provided certain documents and materials relating to the Company’s supply chain and shipment process to DOC, and DOC is currently reviewing this matter.
DOC has not informed the Company of any specific timeline or schedule under which DOC will provide a response to the Company’s request.
We have in the past, and may from time to time in the future, become involved in legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities.
The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation, including claims regarding patent and other intellectual property rights as well as improper hiring practices. Irrespective of the validity of such claims, we could incur significant costs in the defense thereof or could suffer adverse effects on its operations. ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS
Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on September 19, 2022, contains risk factors identified by the Company.
Except as noted below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors we previously disclosed in our filings with the SEC. Our operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or by factors that we currently consider immaterial to our business. Our business operations and financial performance have been, and may in the future continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and related events. Our business operations have been impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn. Numerous governmental jurisdictions have imposed various restrictions on commercial activities, resulting in business closures, work stoppages, labor shortage, disruptions to ports, vaccine mandates and other shipping infrastructure, border closures, thereby negatively impacting our customers, suppliers, distributors, employees, offices, and the entire semiconductor ecosystem. At the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result of changing consumer behaviors due to various government restrictions and the growing trend to provide remote-working options by employers, we experienced shifting market trends, including an increasing demand in markets for notebooks, PCs, gaming devices and other products. While we have benefited from the increasing demand for PC related products, there is no guarantee that this trend will continue, and such increasing demand may discontinue or decline as government authorities relax or terminate COVID-19 related restrictions and consumer behaviors change in response to the reopening of certain economic activities.
Infection rates continued to fluctuate in various regions and new strains of the virus remain a risk, including a surge of COVID-19 cases and hospitalization due to the spread of Omicron variants in late 2021 and early 2022. During the first half of calendar year of 2022, COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rate continued to decline and governments in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and Europe, have lifted various restrictions and limitations on economic activities. At the same time, however, new variants of COVID-19 continued to emerge and contributed to recent rise of infection rates in various jurisdictions in which we operate, including China and U.S. Additionally, during the first half of calendar year 2022, our financial results were negatively impacted temporarily by the suspension of operation of our Shanghai factories as a result of the city-lockdown imposed by Chinese government under the Zero-COVID Policy.
Recently, the Chinese government lifted or eliminated most of its COVID-related restrictions, which caused a significant increase of infection rates among its population. While we have also experienced an increase of worker absence due to sickness, it has not resulted in any material effect on our operations.
Nevertheless, we cannot predict the future trend of the pandemic, including whether additional restrictions will be imposed by the Chinese government or governments in other jurisdictions where we have operation.
49 We may be subject to the ongoing global impacts resulting from the pandemic, including disruption of the product supply chains, shortages of semiconductor components and raw materials, and delays in shipments, product development, and product launches and rising inflation rates, any of which may adversely affect our operations. In addition, actions by United States federal, state and local governments, as well as by foreign governments, to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel bans, stay-at-home orders and school, business and entertainment venue closures, also had a significant adverse effect on the markets in which we conduct our businesses. COVID-19 poses the risk that our workforce, suppliers, and other partners may be prevented from conducting normal business activities for an extended period of time, including due to shutdowns or stay-at-home orders that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. The full extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on many factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic; the availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines; the spread of new variants of COVID-19; the continued and renewed imposition of protective public safety measures such as lockdowns and quarantines; the continuing global disruption in supply chains in our industries and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy, inflation and demand for consumer products. Even after the pandemic has subsided and economic activities gradually increase, we may continue to experience material and adverse impacts to our business, operating results, and financial condition as a result of the pandemic’s lasting global economic impact, including any recession that may occur in the future in our industries, as well as possible continuing inflationary impacts resulting from these factors. We may be adversely affected by the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and other industry-wide and market trends. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change such as the introduction of smart phones and tablets that contributed to the decline in the PC market, product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, uncertain product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. The industry has, from time to time, experienced significant and sometimes prolonged, downturns, which were often connected with or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices.
In addition, because our products target mostly applications in consumer electronics, including PCs and mobile devices, any micro environment and industry-wide trend affecting demand for consumer electronics may impact our business operations and financial results.
For example, the semiconductor market experienced a significant inventory correction by our distributors and customers in the first quarter of 2023, driven primarily by excess inventory accumulated in the past two years in response to substantial growth in consumer electronic sales since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic.
Such inventory correction is expected to result in a significant reduction of customer demand and revenue for our products for the quarter ending March 31, 2023.
While we are projecting this downward trend to subside, and the market demand to recover significantly, during the second half of calendar 2023, there is no guarantee that this will occur. Any prolonged downturn in the consumer electronic market and further inventory correction will adversely affect our business operation and financial results.
Any future downturns, in particular the PC markets or in any other markets in which we sell our products, may reduce our revenue and result in us having excess inventory. By contrast, any upturn in the semiconductor industry could result in increased competition for access to limited third-party foundry and packaging and testing capacity, which could prevent us from benefiting from such an upturn or reduce our profit margins. 50 ITEM 2.
UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS In September 2017, the Board of Directors approved a repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”) that allowed us to repurchase our common shares from the open market pursuant to a pre-established Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or through privately negotiated transactions up to an aggregate of $30.0 million.
The amount and timing of any repurchases under the Repurchase Program depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to, the trading price, volume and availability of our common shares.
There is no guarantee that such repurchases under the Repurchase Program will enhance the value of our shares.
Shares repurchased under this program are accounted for as treasury shares and the total cost of shares repurchased is recorded as a reduction of shareholders' equity.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we
did not repurchase any shares under the Repurchase Program.
As of December 31, 2022, approximately
$13.4 million remained available under the Repurchase Program and the Company has entered into a 10b5-1 repurchase plan to purchase up to such remaining amount under the Repurchase Program. 51 ITEM 3.
