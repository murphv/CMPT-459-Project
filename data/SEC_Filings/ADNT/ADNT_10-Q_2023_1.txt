Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 6 Adient plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Adient is a global leader in the automotive seating supplier industry. Adient has a leading market position in the Americas, Europe and China, and has longstanding relationships with the largest global original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, in the automotive space. Adient's proprietary technologies extend into virtually every area of automotive seating solutions, including complete seating systems, frames, mechanisms, foam, head restraints, armrests and trim covers. Adient is an independent seat supplier with global scale and the capability to design, develop, engineer, manufacture, and deliver complete seat systems and components in every major automotive producing region in the world. Basis of Presentation The unaudited consolidated financial statements of Adient have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the US Securities and Exchange Commission and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). These interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) that management believes are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Adient for the interim periods presented.
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of full-year results particularly as Adient, along with the automotive industry, continues to recover from supply chain disruptions, reacts to inflationary pressures on input costs (particularly labor, freight and utility costs), manages changing COVID-19 regulations in China, and as it addresses the impacts of higher interest rates and softening consumer demand. Principles of Consolidation Adient consolidates its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which it has a controlling interest. Investments in partially-owned affiliates are accounted for by the equity method when Adient's interest exceeds 20% and does not have a controlling interest. Consolidated VIEs Based upon the criteria set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810, "Consolidation," Adient has determined that it was the primary beneficiary in
two
variable interest entities (VIEs) for the reporting periods ended December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022, respectively, as Adient absorbs significant economics of the entities and has the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the entities. The
two
VIEs manufacture seating products in North America for the automotive industry. Adient funds the entities' short-term liquidity needs through revolving credit facilities and has the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the entities through its key customer supply relationships. The carrying amounts and classification of assets (none of which is restricted) and liabilities included in Adient's consolidated statements of financial position for the consolidated VIEs are as follows: (in millions) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Current assets $ 205   $ 262   Noncurrent assets 157   113   Total assets $ 362   $ 375   Current liabilities $ 193   $ 233   Noncurrent liabilities 14   14   Total liabilities $ 207   $ 247   Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 7 Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share: Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income (loss) attributable to Adient $ 12   $ ( 54 ) Denominator: Shares outstanding 95.1   94.6   Effect of dilutive securities 0.8   —   Diluted shares 95.9   94.6   Earnings (loss) per share: Basic $ 0.13   $ ( 0.57 ) Diluted $ 0.13   $ ( 0.57 ) The effect of common stock equivalents that would have been anti-dilutive was excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and was immaterial. Potentially dilutive securities whose effect would have been anti-dilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2021 as a result of being in a loss position. New Accounting Pronouncements Standards Adopted During Fiscal 2023 On October 1, 2022, Adient adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASU) 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock. The adoption of this guidance on October 1, 2022 did not significantly impact Adient's consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2022. On October 1, 2022, Adient adopted ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832) - Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance. The ASU requires annual disclosures of: (i) information about the nature of government assistance transactions and the related accounting policy used to account for the transactions; (ii) the balance sheet and income statement line items affected by the transactions, and the amounts for each financial statement line item; and (iii) significant transaction terms and conditions. The adoption of this guidance on October 1, 2022 did not significantly impact Adient's consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Standards Effective After Fiscal 2023 Adient has considered the ASU summarized below, effective after fiscal 2023, which is not expected to significantly impact the consolidated financial statements: Standard Adopted Description Date Effective
ASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations The ASU requires buyers of goods and services to disclose information about supplier finance programs if such arrangements are used to manage their payables. The disclosures should include both qualitative and quantitative information including key terms and the amount of outstanding obligations. October 1, 2023 Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 8 2. Revenue Recognition Adient generates revenue through the sale of automotive seating solutions, including complete seating systems and the components of complete seating systems. Adient provides production and service parts to its customers under awarded multi-year programs. The duration of a program is generally consistent with the life cycle of a vehicle, however, the program can be canceled at any time without cause by the customer. Programs awarded to Adient to supply parts to its customers do not contain a firm commitment by the customer for volume or price and do not reach the level of a performance obligation until Adient receives either a purchase order and/or a materials release from the customer for a specific number of parts at a specified price, at which point an enforceable contract exists. Sales revenue is generally recognized at the point in time when parts are shipped and control has transferred to the customer, at which point an enforceable right to payment exists. Contracts may provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the awarded program, and prices are adjusted on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in product content/cost and other commercial factors. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that Adient expects to be entitled to in exchange for such products based on purchase orders, annual price reductions and ongoing price adjustments (some of which are accounted for as variable consideration and subject to being constrained), net of the impact, if any, of consideration paid to the customer. In a typical arrangement with the customer, purchase orders are issued for pre-production activities which consist of engineering, design and development, tooling and prototypes for the manufacture and delivery of component parts. Adient has concluded that these activities are not in the scope of ASC 606. Adient includes shipping and handling fees billed to customers in revenue, while including costs of shipping and handling in cost of sales. Taxes collected from customers are excluded from revenue and credited directly to obligations to the appropriate government agencies. Payment terms with customers are established based on customary industry and regional practices. Adient has evaluated the terms of its arrangements and determined that they do not contain significant financing components. Contract assets primarily relate to the right to consideration for work completed, but not billed at the reporting date on contracts with customers. The contracts assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional. Contract liabilities primarily relate to contracts where advance payments or deposits have been received, but performance obligations have not yet been satisfied and revenue has not been recognized. No significant contract assets or liabilities exist at September 30, 2022 or at December 31, 2022. As described above, the issuance of a purchase order and/or a materials release by the customer represents the point at which an enforceable contract with the customer exists. Therefore, Adient has elected to apply the practical expedient in ASC 606, paragraph 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about the remaining performance obligations that have an original expected duration of one year or less. Refer to Note 15, "Segment Information," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disaggregated revenue by geographical market. 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures In fiscal 2022, Adient entered into an agreement whereby Adient would purchase all of the issued and outstanding equity interest in Nantong Yanfeng Adient Seating Trim Co., Ltd. ("YFAT") held by KEIPER Seating Mechanisms Co., Ltd. ("KEIPER") for ¥ 150  million ($ 24  million). Adient made an initial deposit of ¥ 75  million ($ 12  million) in fiscal 2022, which represents
50 % of the estimated purchase price (reflected within other current assets as of September 30, 2022). During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Adient made an additional deposit of ¥ 38  million ($ 6  million) in conjunction with the public bidding process. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals in China, and is expected to be completed during the first half of fiscal 2023. The remaining balance of the estimated purchase price will be paid at the time of completion of the transaction. Also in fiscal 2022, Adient entered into agreements whereby Adient would transfer all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in
two
joint ventures in China held directly by Adient, each of which represents
25 % of their total issued and outstanding equity interests, to Yanfeng for $ 3  million. As a result, Adient concluded that indicators of other-than-temporary impairment were present related to the investments in these joint ventures, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $ 3  million during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The sale of
one
of the joint ventures was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein Adient received $ 3  million of sale proceeds. The sale of the other joint venture closed in January 2023 for minimal proceeds. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, Adient received final cash proceeds of $ 652  million for the sale of its
49.99 % interest in Yanfeng Adient Seating Co., Ltd.("YFAS"), a joint venture previously owned by Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems Company
Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 9 Ltd. ("Yanfeng") ( 50.01 %) and Adient ( 49.99 %), which closed in fiscal 2021, and $ 41  million representing the remaining balance of proceeds from the sale of its interest in Yanfeng Global Automotive Interior Systems Co. ("YFAI"), a joint venture previously owned by Yanfeng ( 70 %) and Adient ( 30 %) which closed in fiscal 2020. Also during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, Adient collected cash proceeds of $ 36  million for sale of certain assets in Turkey. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, Chongqing Boxun Industrial Co., Ltd. (“Boxun”) exercised its right to sell its
25 % equity interest in Chongqing Adient Automotive Components Co., Ltd. (“CQADNT”) to Adient. As a result, Adient reclassified the redeemable noncontrolling interests balance of $ 186  million to other current liabilities on December 31, 2021 as the obligation was determined to be unconditional. The acquisition of Boxun's
25 % interest closed in January 2022 which resulted in Adient owning
100 % of CQADNT. 4. Inventories Inventories consisted of the following: (in millions) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Raw materials and supplies $ 756   $ 755   Work-in-process 31   26   Finished goods 185   172   Inventories $ 972   $ 953   5.

million and $ 13
million, respectively. Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 10 6. Product Warranties Adient offers warranties to its customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement. A typical warranty program requires that Adient replace defective products within a specified time period from the date of sale. Adient records an estimate for future warranty-related costs based on actual historical return rates and other known factors. Based on analysis of return rates and other factors, Adient's warranty provisions are adjusted as necessary. Adient monitors its warranty activity and adjusts its reserve estimates when it is probable that future warranty costs will be different than those estimates. Adient's product warranty liability is recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position in other current liabilities. The changes in Adient's total product warranty liability are as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Balance at beginning of period $ 21   $ 23   Accruals for warranties issued during the period 2   2   Changes in accruals related to pre-existing warranties (including changes in estimates) —   1   Settlements made (in cash or in kind) during the period ( 4 ) ( 3 ) Currency translation 1   —   Balance at end of period $ 20   $ 23   7. Leases Adient's lease portfolio consists of operating leases for real estate including production facilities, warehouses and administrative offices, equipment such as forklifts and computer servers and laptops, and fleet vehicles.

The ABL Credit Facility, as amended in November 2022, is set to mature on November 2, 2027, subject to certain springing maturity provisions. Adient will pay a commitment fee of
0.25 % to
0.375 % on the unused portion of the commitments under the asset-based revolving credit facility based on average global availability. Letters of credit are limited to the lesser of (x) $ 150  million and (y) the aggregate unused amount of commitments under the ABL Credit Facility then in effect. Subject to certain conditions, the ABL Credit Facility may be expanded by up to $ 250  million in additional commitments. Loans under the ABL Credit Facility may be denominated, at the option of Adient, in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling or Swedish Kroner. It also provides flexibility for future amendments to the ABL Facility to incorporate certain sustainability-based pricing provisions. The ABL Credit Agreement is secured on a first-priority lien on all accounts receivable, inventory and bank accounts (and funds on deposit therein) and a second-priority lien on all of the tangible and intangible assets of certain Adient subsidiaries.
Interest is payable on the ABL Credit Facility at a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to SOFR, in the case of amounts outstanding in dollars, EURIBOR, in the case of amounts outstanding in euros, STIBOR, in the case of amounts outstanding in Swedish krona and SONIA, in the case of amounts outstanding in pounds sterling, in each case, plus an applicable margin of
1.50 % to
2.00 %. As of December 31, 2022, Adient had not drawn down on the ABL Credit Facility and had availability under this facility of $ 971
million (net of $ 13  million of letters of credit). In addition, Adient US and Adient Global Holdings S.à r.l., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adient, maintain a term loan credit agreement, as amended in fiscal 2021, (the “Term Loan B Agreement”) that provides for a $ 985
million senior secured term loan facility. The Term Loan B Agreement amortizes in equal quarterly installments at a rate of
1.00 % per annum of the original principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance due at final maturity on April 8, 2028. Interest on the Term Loan B Agreement accrues at the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin equal to
3.25 %. The Term Loan B Agreement also permits Adient to incur incremental term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of $ 750  million and an unlimited amount subject to a pro forma first lien secured net leverage ratio of not greater than
1.75
to 1.00 and certain other conditions. The ABL Credit Facility and Term Loan B Agreement contain covenants that are usual and customary for facilities and debt instruments of this type and that, among other things, restrict the ability of Adient and its restricted subsidiaries to: create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee certain indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions on, or repurchase or redeem, Adient’s capital stock or certain other debt; make other restricted payments; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of Adient’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ assets, to another person. These covenants are subject to a number of other limitations and exceptions set
Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 13 forth in the agreements. The agreements also provide for customary events of default, including, but not limited to, cross-default clauses with other debt arrangements, failure to pay principal and interest, failure to comply with covenants, agreements or conditions, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency involving Adient and its significant subsidiaries. Adient Global Holdings Ltd. ("AGH"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adient, previously maintained $ 900  million aggregate principal amount of
4.875 % USD-denominated unsecured notes due 2026. Adient redeemed $ 103  million and $ 2  million during fiscal 2020 and 2021, respectively, resulting in a remaining balance of $ 795  million as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. AGH also previously maintained € 1.0  billion aggregate principal amount of
3.50 % unsecured notes due 2024. During fiscal 2022, Adient repurchased € 177  million ($ 198  million) of the
3.50 % unsecured notes due 2024 at a premium of € 3  million ($ 4  million) plus € 3  million ($ 3  million) of accrued and unpaid interest, and expensed € 1  million ($ 1  million) of previously deferred financing costs to net financing charges. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining balance of this debt was € 823  million ($ 878  million). Net Financing Charges Adient's net financing charges in the consolidated statements of income (loss) contained the following components: Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest costs $ 41   $ 46   Banking fees and debt issuance cost amortization 4   3   Interest income ( 4 ) ( 2 ) Derivative loss on Yanfeng transaction —   3   Net financing charges $ 41   $ 50   Total interest paid on both short and long-term debt for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 20  million and $ 41  million, respectively. Adient enters into supply chain financing programs in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions to either sell or discount accounts receivable without recourse to third-party institutions. Sales or discounts of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the consolidated statements of financial position and the proceeds are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, $ 181  million was funded under these programs compared to $ 269  million as of September 30, 2022. 9. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Adient selectively uses derivative instruments to reduce Adient's market risk associated with changes in foreign currency. Under Adient's policy, the use of derivatives is restricted to those intended for hedging purposes; the use of any derivative instrument for speculative purposes is strictly prohibited. A description of each type of derivative utilized to manage Adient's risk is included in the following paragraphs. In addition, refer to Note 10, "Fair Value Measurements," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to the fair value measurements and valuation methods utilized by Adient for each derivative type. Adient has global operations and participates in the foreign exchange markets to minimize its risk of loss from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Adient primarily uses foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign exchange rate exposures. Adient hedges
70 % to
90 % of the nominal amount of each of its known foreign exchange transactional exposures. Gains and losses on derivative contracts offset gains and losses on underlying foreign currency exposures. These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges under ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging," and the hedge gains or losses due to changes in fair value are initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions occur and affect earnings. All contracts were highly effective in hedging the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 14 As of December 31, 2022, the € 823
million ($ 878  million) aggregate principal amount of
3.50 % euro-denominated unsecured notes due 2024 was designated as a net investment hedge to selectively hedge portions of Adient's net investment in Europe. The currency effects of Adient's euro-denominated bonds are reflected in the AOCI account within shareholders' equity attributable to Adient where they offset gains and losses recorded on Adient's net investment in Europe. Adient entered into a ¥ 150  million ($ 23  million) foreign exchange forward contract during fiscal 2022 to selectively hedge portions of its net investment in China. The currency effects of the forward contract were reflected in the AOCI account within shareholder’s equity attributable to Adient, where they offset gains and losses recorded on Adient’s net investment in China. The forward contract matured during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The following table presents the location and fair values of derivative instruments and other amounts used in hedging activities included in Adient's consolidated statements of financial position:   Derivatives and Hedging Activities Designated as Hedging Instruments under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging Activities Not Designated as Hedging Instruments under ASC 815 (in millions) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Other current assets Foreign currency exchange derivatives $ 26   $ 17   $ 3   $ 3   Other noncurrent assets Foreign currency exchange derivatives 2   —   —   —   Total assets $ 28   $ 17   $ 3   $ 3   Other current liabilities Foreign currency exchange derivatives $ 8   $ 20   $ —   $ —   Other noncurrent liabilities Foreign currency exchange derivatives —   2   —   1   Long-term debt Foreign currency denominated debt 878   809   —   —   Total liabilities $ 886   $ 831   $ —   $ 1   Adient enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Associations (ISDA) master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under the derivative contracts. The master netting agreements generally provide for net settlement of all outstanding contracts with a counterparty in the case of an event of default or a termination event. Adient has not elected to offset the fair value positions of the derivative contracts recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position. Collateral is generally not required of Adient or the counterparties under the master netting agreements. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022,
no
cash collateral was received or pledged under the master netting agreements. The gross and net amounts of derivative instruments and other amounts used in hedging activities are as follows:
Assets Liabilities (in millions) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Gross amount recognized $ 31   $ 20   $ 886   $ 832   Gross amount eligible for offsetting ( 5 ) ( 19 ) ( 5 ) ( 19 ) Net amount $ 26   $ 1   $ 881   $ 813   The following table presents the effective portion of pretax gains (losses) recorded in other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges: Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 15 Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Foreign currency exchange derivatives $ 32   $ ( 2 ) The following table presents the location and amount of the effective portion of pretax gains (losses) on cash flow hedges reclassified from AOCI into Adient's consolidated statements of income: (in millions) Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Foreign currency exchange derivatives Cost of sales $ 7   $ 1   The following table presents the location and amount of pretax gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments recognized in Adient's consolidated statements of income (loss): (in millions) Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Foreign currency exchange derivatives Cost of sales $ 3   $ 1   Foreign currency exchange derivatives Net financing charges 9   ( 15 ) Total $ 12   $ ( 14 ) The effective portion of pretax gains (losses) recorded in currency translation adjustment (CTA) within other comprehensive income (loss) related to net investment hedges was $( 69 ) million and $ 29
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
no
gains or losses were reclassified from CTA into income for Adient's outstanding net investment hedges. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
no
ineffectiveness was recognized in the consolidated statements of income (loss) resulting from cash flow hedges . 10. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurement," defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability as follows: Level 1:
Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2:
Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and Level 3:
Unobservable inputs where there is little or no market data, which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. ASC 820 requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 16 Recurring Fair Value Measurements The following tables present Adient's fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value:   Fair Value Measurements Using: (in millions) Total as of
December 31, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Other current assets Foreign currency exchange derivatives $ 29   $ —   $ 29   $ —   Other noncurrent assets Foreign currency exchange derivatives 2   —   2   —   Total assets $ 31   $ —   $ 31   $ —   Other current liabilities Foreign currency exchange derivatives 8   —   8   —   Total liabilities $ 8   $ —   $ 8   $ —   Fair Value Measurements Using: (in millions) Total as of September 30, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Other current assets Foreign currency exchange derivatives $ 20   $ —   $ 20   $ —   Other noncurrent assets Interest rate cap —   —   —   —   Total assets $ 20   $ —   $ 20   $ —   Other current liabilities Foreign currency exchange derivatives $ 20   $ —   $ 20   $ —   Other noncurrent liabilities Foreign currency exchange derivatives 3   —   3   —   Total liabilities $ 23   $ —   $ 23   $ —   Valuation Methods Foreign currency exchange derivatives
Adient selectively hedges anticipated transactions and net investments that are subject to foreign exchange rate risk primarily using foreign currency exchange hedge contracts. The foreign currency exchange derivatives are valued under a market approach using publicized spot and forward prices. Changes in fair value on foreign exchange derivatives accounted for as hedging instruments under ASC 815 are initially recorded as a component of AOCI and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions occur and affect earnings. These contracts were highly effective in hedging the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The changes in fair value of foreign currency exchange derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815 are recorded in the consolidated statements of income.
Cross-currency interest rate swaps
Adient determines the fair value of a cross-currency interest rate swap contract using a market approach which is based on quoted market price for similar instruments in markets. All significant inputs are corroborated by observable market data for the term of such a contract. Adient selectively uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge portions of its net investments. Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 17 Interest rate caps
Adient determines the fair value of an interest rate cap contract using a market approach which is based on quoted market price for identical or similar instruments in markets. All significant inputs are corroborated by observable market data for the term of such a contract. As of December 31, 2022, Adient had
no
interest rate caps outstanding. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term debt and accounts payable approximate their carrying values. The fair value of long-term debt, which was $ 2.5  billion
a nd $ 2.4
billion at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively, was determined primarily using market quotes classified as Level 1 inputs within the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy. 11.

These redeemable noncontrolling interests are reported at their estimated redemption value. Any adjustment to the redemption value impacts retained earnings but does not impact net income. Redeemable noncontrolling interests which are redeemable only upon future events, the occurrence of which is not currently probable, are recorded at carrying value.
The following table presents changes in the redeemable noncontrolling interests: Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Beginning balance $ 45   $ 240   Net income 7   13   Dividends ( 18 ) ( 31 ) Change in redeemable noncontrolling interest —   ( 186 ) Foreign currency translation adjustments 11   5   Ending balance $ 45   $ 41   Refer to Note 3, "Acquisitions and Divestitures," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the change in redeemable noncontrolling interests during fiscal 2022. Repurchases of Equity Securities In November 2022, Adient’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of the Company’s ordinary shares up to an aggregate purchase price of $ 600  million with no expiration date. Under the share repurchase authorization, Adient’s ordinary shares may be purchased either through discretionary purchases on the open market, by block trades or privately negotiated transactions. The number of ordinary shares repurchased, if any, and the timing of repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including share price, trading volume and general market conditions, as well as on working capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors.
No
shares were repurchased under the program during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
12. Retirement Plans Adient maintains non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering primarily non-U.S. employees and a limited number of U.S. employees.
The following table contains the components of net periodic benefit cost: Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 19 Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Service cost $ 1   $ 2   Interest cost 4   3   Expected return on plan assets ( 3 ) ( 4 ) Net actuarial and settlement/curtailment (gain) loss 8   —   Net periodic benefit cost $ 10   $ 1   The interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and net actuarial and settlement/curtailment (gain) loss components of net periodic benefit cost are included in other pension expense (income) in the consolidated statements of income (loss). During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Adient recorded an $ 8  million curtailment loss associated with employee termination benefit plans in the Americas segment.
13. Restructuring and Impairment Costs To better align its resources with its overall strategies and reduce the cost structure of its global operations to address the softness in certain underlying markets, Adient commits to restructuring plans as necessary. During fiscal 2023, Adient committed to a restructuring plan ("2023 Plan") of $ 7  million. The restructuring actions relate to cost reduction initiatives and consist primarily of workforce reductions in EMEA. The restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by fiscal 2026. Restructuring costs are included in restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income (loss). The following tables summarize the changes in Adient's restructuring reserve during the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022:
(in millions) Employee Severance and Termination Benefits Currency Translation Total Balance at September 30, 2022 $ 69   $ ( 9 ) $ 60   2023 Plan charges 7   —   7   Utilized - cash ( 27 ) —   ( 27 ) Noncash and other adjustments —   5   5   Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 49   $ ( 4 ) $ 45   (in millions) Employee Severance and Termination Benefits Currency Translation Total Balance at September 30, 2021 $ 111   $ 4   $ 115   2022 Plan charges 3   —   3   Utilized - cash ( 24 ) —   ( 24 ) Noncash and other adjustments ( 7 ) ( 1 ) ( 8 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 83   $ 3   $ 86   Adient's restructuring plans include workforce reductions of approximately
14,000
employees. Restructuring charges associated with employee severance and termination benefits are paid over the severance period granted to each employee or on a lump sum basis in accordance with individual severance agreements. As of December 31, 2022, approximately
12,000
of the employees have been separated from Adient pursuant to the restructuring plans. In addition, the restructuring plans included
twenty-seven
plant closures. As of December 31, 2022,
twenty-one
of the
twenty-seven
plants have been closed. Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 20 Adient's management closely monitors its overall cost structure and continually analyzes each of its businesses for opportunities to consolidate current operations, improve operating efficiencies and locate facilities in low cost countries in close proximity to customers. This ongoing analysis includes a review of its manufacturing, engineering, purchasing and administrative functions, as well as the overall global footprint for all its businesses. Because of the importance of new vehicle sales by major automotive manufacturers to operations, Adient is affected by the general business conditions in the automotive industry. Future adverse developments in the automotive industry could impact Adient's liquidity position, lead to impairment charges and/or require additional restructuring of its operations. 14. Income Taxes In calculating the provision for income taxes, Adient uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. On a quarterly basis, the actual effective tax rate is adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in facts and circumstances, if any, as compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year and each interim period thereafter. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Adient’s income tax expense was $ 31  million equating to an effective tax rate of
48 %. The three month income tax expense was higher than the Irish statutory rate of 12.5% primarily due to the inability to record a tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances and foreign tax rate differentials. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, Adient’s income tax expense was $ 21  million equating to an effective tax rate of ( 233 )%. The three month income tax expense was higher than the statutory rate impact of 12.5% primarily due to the inability to record a tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances and foreign tax rate differentials. Valuation Allowances As a result of the Company's first quarter fiscal 2023 analysis of the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, Adient determined that no changes to valuation allowances were required. Adient reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or combined group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. All of the factors that Adient considers in evaluating whether and when to establish or release all or a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance involve significant judgment. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to Adient's valuation allowances may be necessary. Uncertain Tax Positions At December 31, 2022, Adient had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of $ 522  million. If recognized, $ 122  million of Adient's unrecognized tax benefits would impact the effective tax rate. Total net accrued interest at December 31, 2022 was approximately $ 25  million (net of tax benefit). The interest and penalties accrued for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $ 2  million.
Adient recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 15. Segment Information Adient manages its business on a geographic basis and operates in the following
three
reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: (i) Americas, which is inclusive of North America and South America; (ii) Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"); and (iii) Asia Pacific/China ("Asia"). Adient evaluates the performance of its reportable segments using an adjusted EBITDA metric defined as income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding net financing charges, restructuring and impairment costs, restructuring related-costs, net mark-to-market adjustments on pension and postretirement plans, transaction gains/losses, purchase accounting amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and other non-recurring items ("Adjusted EBITDA"). Also, certain corporate-related costs are not allocated to the segments. The reportable segments are consistent with how management views the markets served by Adient and reflect the financial information that is reviewed by its chief operating decision maker.

Nonconsolidated Partially-Owned Affiliates Investments in the net assets of nonconsolidated partially-owned affiliates are reported in the "Investments in partially-owned affiliates" line in the consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. Equity in the net income of nonconsolidated partially-owned affiliates are reported in the "Equity income (loss)" line in the consolidated statements of income (loss) for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 23 Adient maintains total investments in partially-owned affiliates of $ 306  million and $ 286  million at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.
Operating information for nonconsolidated partially-owned affiliates is as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Income statement data: Net sales $ 976   $ 1,208   Gross profit $ 101   $ 127   Net income $ 60   $ 67   Net income attributable to the entity $ 59   $ 67   Refer to Note 3, "Acquisitions and Divestitures," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for transactions involving Adient's investments in nonconsolidated partially-owned affiliates.
17. Commitments and Contingencies Adient is involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the operation of its businesses, including those pertaining to product liability, casualty environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment, commercial and contractual matters, and various other matters. Although the outcome of any such lawsuit, claim or proceeding cannot be predicted with certainty and some may be disposed of unfavorably to Adient, it is management's opinion that none of these will have a material adverse effect on Adient's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Costs related to such matters were not material to the periods presented. Adient accrues for potential environmental liabilities when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable. Reserves for environmental liabilities totaled $ 5  million and $ 6  million at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Adient reviews the status of its environmental sites on a quarterly basis and adjusts its reserves accordingly. Such potential liabilities accrued by Adient do not take into consideration possible recoveries of future insurance proceeds. They do, however, take into account the likely share other parties will bear at remediation sites. It is difficult to estimate Adient's ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large number of other parties that may be involved, the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties, the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted, the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment, the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites, the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur, and changing environmental laws. Nevertheless, Adient does not currently believe that any claims, penalties or costs in connection with known environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on Adient's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 26 Factors Affecting Adient’s Operating Environment The first quarter results of fiscal 2023 are not necessarily indicative of full-year results particularly as Adient, along with the automotive industry, continues to recover from supply chain disruptions, reacts to inflationary pressures on input costs (particularly labor, freight and utility costs), manages changing COVID-19 regulations in China, and as it addresses the impacts of higher interest rates and softening consumer demand. Refer to the consolidated results of operations and segment analysis discussion below for additional information on the impacts of these items on Adient's results. Global Automotive Industry Adient conducts its business globally in the automotive industry, which is highly competitive and sensitive to economic, political and social factors in the various regions. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, global light vehicle production increased 5.4% year over year driven by improved production volumes in North America and Asia, excluding China, offset by softening demand in both EMEA and China regions. The operating environment is expected to continue to be challenging during the remainder of fiscal 2023 as the automotive industry recovers from supply chain disruptions, reacts to inflationary pressures on input costs, and addresses the impacts of higher interest rates and softening consumer demand. Light vehicle production levels by geographic region are provided below: Light Vehicle Production Three Months Ended December 31, (units in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Global 21.6  5.4  % 20.5  North America 3.6  9.1  % 3.3  South America 0.7  —  % 0.7  EMEA 4.2  (4.5) % 4.4  China 7.2  (2.7) % 7.4  Asia, excluding China, and Other 5.9  25.5  % 4.7  Source: S&P, January 2023 Financial Results Summary Significant aspects of Adient's financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 include the following: • Adient recorded net sales of $3,699 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, representing an increase of $219 million or 6.3% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in net sales is attributable to higher overall production volumes in all regions (primarily Americas and Asia), favorable material economics recoveries, and higher levels of commercial settlements, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies. • Gross profit was $231 million, or 6.2% of net sales, for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $173 million, or 5.0% of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Profitability, including gross profit as a percentage of net sales, was higher due to higher production volumes (primarily Americas and Asia) and higher levels of commercial settlements, partially offset by increased utilities, labor and freight costs, unfavorable impacts of material economics, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies. • Equity income was $28 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to $33 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease is primarily attributable to the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies, the impact of lower volumes at partially-owned affiliates in China, and the impact of KEIPER supply agreement modifications executed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. • Net income attributable to Adient was $12 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to net loss attributable to Adient of $54 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The net income in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 is primarily attributable to higher overall production volumes, higher commercial settlements, lower selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), favorable material economics recoveries, and lower net financing charges, partially offset by higher
Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 27 freight, utilities and labor costs, lower equity income, higher other pension expense, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies.

Cost of Sales / Gross Profit Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Cost of sales $ 3,468 5% $ 3,307 Gross profit $ 231 34% $ 173 % of sales 6.2% 5.0% Cost of sales increased by $161 million, or 5%, and gross profit increased by $58 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The year over year increase in cost of sales was due to higher production volumes ($321 million), increased utilities, labor and freight costs along with operating inefficiencies associated with supply chain issues ($35 million), and higher commodity costs ($33 million), partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currencies ($199 million), favorable supplier pricing ($18 million), the favorable impact of the KEIPER supply agreement modifications ($6 million), and lower depreciation expense ($5 million). Gross profit was impacted by higher overall production volumes, and
Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 28 higher levels of commercial settlements, partially offset by higher utilities, labor and freight costs, and unfavorable net material economics recoveries. Refer to the segment analysis below for a discussion of segment profitability. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 138 (15)% $ 162 % of sales 3.7% 4.7% SG&A expenses decreased by $24 million, or 15% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The year over year decrease in SG&A is attributable to the favorable impact of foreign currencies ($8 million), lower overall engineering and other administrative spending ($7 million), lower compensation expense including stock-based and performance-based incentive compensation costs ($7 million), and lower depreciation and amortization expense ($2 million).
Restructuring and Impairment Costs Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Restructuring and impairment costs $ 7  75% $ 4  Restructuring and impairment costs were higher by $3 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 13, "Restructuring and Impairment Costs," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to Adient's restructuring plans. Equity Income (Loss) Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Equity income (loss) $ 28  (15)% $ 33  Equity income was $28 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to $33 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease is primarily attributable to the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($3 million), and the impact of lower volumes at partially-owned affiliates in China and as a result of the KEIPER supply agreement modifications executed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 ($3 million).
Net Financing Charges Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Net financing charges $ 41  (18)% $ 50  Net financing charges decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 as a result of lower levels of outstanding debt, and the prior year $3 million derivative loss related to the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction. Refer to Note 8, "Debt and Financing Arrangements," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to Adient's debt transactions during the current quarter and components of the net financing charges. Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 29 Other Pension Expense (Income)
Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Other pension expense (income) $ 9  >100% $ (1) Other pension expense was higher by $10 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 due primarily to an $8 million curtailment loss associated with employee termination benefit plans in the Americas segment. Refer to Note 12, "Retirement Plans," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the non-service components of Adient's net periodic pension costs. Income Tax Provision Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Income tax provision (benefit) $ 31  48% $ 21  The first quarter of fiscal 2023 income tax expense of $31 million was higher than the statutory rate of 12.5% primarily due to the inability to record a tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances and foreign tax rate differentials. The first quarter of fiscal 2022 income tax expense of $21 million was higher than the statutory rate of 12.5% primarily due to the inability to record a tax benefit for losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances and foreign tax rate differentials. Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests $ 21  (13)% $ 24  The decreases in income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 is primarily attributable to lower production volumes at certain affiliates in various jurisdictions. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Adient Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Net income (loss) attributable to Adient $ 12  >100% $ (54) Net income attributable to Adient was $12 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to $54 million of net loss attributable to Adient for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The higher net income in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 is primarily attributable to higher overall production volumes primarily in Americas and Asia, higher commercial settlements, lower SG&A expenses, favorable material economics recoveries, and lower net financing charges, partially offset by higher freight, labor and utilities costs, lower equity income, higher other pension expense, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies. Comprehensive Income (Loss) Attributable to Adient Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Comprehensive income (loss) attributable to Adient $ 127  >100% $ (39) Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 30 Comprehensive loss attributable to Adient was $127 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $39 million of comprehensive loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase of $166 million is due primarily to higher net income ($63 million), the favorable impact of foreign currency translation adjustments ($82 million), and the impact of realized and unrealized gains on derivatives ($23 million), partially offset by higher comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests ($6 million). Segment Analysis Adient manages its business on a geographic basis and operates in the following three reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: (i) Americas, which is inclusive of North America and South America; (ii) Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"); and (iii) Asia Pacific/China ("Asia"). Adient evaluates the performance of its reportable segments using an adjusted EBITDA metric defined as income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding net financing charges, restructuring and impairment costs, restructuring related-costs, net mark-to-market adjustments on pension plans, transaction gains/losses, purchase accounting amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and other non-recurring items ("Adjusted EBITDA"). Also, certain corporate-related costs are not allocated to the segments. The reportable segments are consistent with how management views the markets served by Adient and reflect the financial information that is reviewed by its chief operating decision maker. The results presented below are not necessarily indicative of full-year results as Adient, along with the automotive industry, continues to recover from supply chain disruptions, reacts to inflationary pressures on input costs (particularly labor, freight and utility costs), manages changing COVID-19 regulations in China, and as it addresses the impacts of higher interest rates and softening consumer demand. Refer to the Factors Affecting Adient’s Operating Environment section within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, for additional information on factors that have impacted Adient.

Americas Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Net sales $ 1,724  15% $ 1,498  Adjusted EBITDA $ 69  >100% $ 9  Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 32 Net sales increased during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 by $226 million primarily as a result of higher current quarter production volumes ($207 million), the impact of favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($24 million), and favorable impact of foreign currencies ($2 million), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of material economics recoveries ($7 million). Adjusted EBITDA increased during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 by $60 million due to higher current quarter production volumes as explained above ($34 million), higher levels of commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments including the impact of the KEIPER supply agreement modifications ($26 million), certain business performance improvements ($6 million), lower administrative and engineering expense ($6 million), the favorable impact of foreign currencies ($3 million), and higher equity income ($1 million), partially offset by higher freight, labor and utility costs ($12 million), and unfavorable material economics, net of recoveries ($4 million). EMEA Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Net sales $ 1,182  (4)% $ 1,230  Adjusted EBITDA $ 28  (35)% $ 43  Net sales decreased during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 by $48 million primarily as a result of the unfavorable impact of foreign currency ($134 million), partially offset by higher production volumes ($59 million), the favorable impact of material economics recoveries ($22 million) and favorable impact of commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($5 million).
Adjusted EBITDA decreased during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 by $15 million due primarily to increased utilities, labor and freight costs ($30 million), unfavorable material economics, net of recoveries ($13 million), and the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($1 million), partially offset by favorable commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($13 million), certain business performance improvements ($6 million), lower administrative and engineering expense ($4 million), higher equity income ($4 million), and higher current quarter production volumes ($2 million). Utility costs have recently shown signs of stabilization; however, Adient expects higher overall operating costs as compared to prior year periods to persist for the remainder of fiscal 2023. Asia Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 Change 2021 Net sales $ 821  5% $ 784  Adjusted EBITDA $ 138  21% $ 114  Net sales increased during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 by $37 million due to higher production volume and mix ($113 million), and favorable impact of commercial settlements and net pricing adjustments ($6 million), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($82 million). Adjusted EBITDA increased during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 by $24 million due to favorable volume and mix ($23 million), favorable commercial settlements (certain of which in China are non-recurring) and net pricing adjustments including the impact of the KEIPER supply agreement modifications ($20 million), and lower administrative and engineering expense ($3 million), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies ($11 million), lower equity income due to lower volumes at partially-owned affiliates and the impact of the KEIPER supply agreement modifications ($8 million), less favorable operational performance and other labor and overhead efficiency improvements ($2 million), and unfavorable impact of material economics, net of recoveries ($1 million). Liquidity and Capital Resources Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 33 Adient's primary liquidity needs are to fund general business requirements, including working capital, capital expenditures, restructuring costs and debt service requirements. Adient's principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, the revolving credit facility and other debt issuances, and existing cash balances. Adient actively manages its working capital and associated cash requirements and continually seeks more effective uses of cash. Working capital is highly influenced by the timing of cash flows associated with sales and purchases, and therefore can be difficult to manage at times. See below for discussion of Adient's financing arrangements. Adient believes that its current financial resources will be sufficient to fund its liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. Adient US LLC ("Adient US"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Adient, together with certain of Adient's other subsidiaries, maintains an asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Credit Facility”), which provides for a revolving line of credit up to $1,250 million, including a North American subfacility of up to $950 million and a European subfacility of up to $300 million, subject to borrowing base capacity and certain other restrictions, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The ABL Credit Facility, as amended in November 2022, is set to mature on November 2, 2027, subject to certain springing maturity provisions. Adient will pay a commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.375% on the unused portion of the commitments under the asset-based revolving credit facility based on average global availability. Letters of credit are limited to the lesser of (x) $150 million and (y) the aggregate unused amount of commitments under the ABL Credit Facility then in effect. Subject to certain conditions, the ABL Credit Facility may be expanded by up to $250 million in additional commitments. Loans under the ABL Credit Facility may be denominated, at the option of Adient, in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling or Swedish Kroner. It also provides flexibility for future amendments to the ABL Facility to incorporate certain sustainability-based pricing provisions. The ABL Credit Agreement is secured on a first-priority lien on all accounts receivable, inventory and bank accounts (and funds on deposit therein) and a second-priority lien on all of the tangible and intangible assets of certain Adient subsidiaries.
Interest is payable on the ABL Credit Facility at a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to SOFR, in the case of amounts outstanding in dollars, EURIBOR, in the case of amounts outstanding in euros, STIBOR, in the case of amounts outstanding in Swedish krona and SONIA, in the case of amounts outstanding in pounds sterling, in each case, plus an applicable margin of 1.50% to 2.00%. As of December 31, 2022, Adient had not drawn down on the ABL Credit Facility and had availability under this facility of $971 million (net of $13 million of letters of credit). In addition, Adient US and Adient Global Holdings S.à r.l., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adient, maintain a term loan credit agreement, as amended in fiscal 2021, (the “Term Loan B Agreement”) that provides for a $985 million senior secured term loan facility. The Term Loan B Agreement amortizes in equal quarterly installments at a rate of 1.00% per annum of the original principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance due at final maturity on April 8, 2028. Interest on the Term Loan B Agreement accrues at the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin equal to 3.25%. The Term Loan B Agreement also permits Adient to incur incremental term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of $750 million and an unlimited amount subject to a pro forma first lien secured net leverage ratio of not greater than 1.75 to 1.00 and certain other conditions. The ABL Credit Facility and Term Loan B Agreement contain covenants that are usual and customary for facilities and debt instruments of this type and that, among other things, restrict the ability of Adient and its restricted subsidiaries to: create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee certain indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions on, or repurchase or redeem, Adient’s capital stock or certain other debt; make other restricted payments; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of Adient’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ assets, to another person. These covenants are subject to a number of other limitations and exceptions set forth in the agreements. The agreements also provide for customary events of default, including, but not limited to, cross-default clauses with other debt arrangements, failure to pay principal and interest, failure to comply with covenants, agreements or conditions, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency involving Adient and its significant subsidiaries. Adient Global Holdings Ltd. ("AGH"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adient, previously maintained $900 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% USD-denominated unsecured notes due 2026. Adient redeemed $103 million and $2 million during fiscal 2020 and 2021, respectively, resulting in a remaining balance of $795 million as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. AGH also previously maintained €1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.50% unsecured notes due 2024. During fiscal 2022, Adient repurchased €177 million ($198 million) of the 3.50% unsecured notes due 2024 at a premium of €3 million ($4 million) plus €3 million ($3 million) of accrued and unpaid interest, and expensed €1 million ($1 million) of previously deferred financing costs to net financing charges. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining balance of this debt was €823 million ($878 million). Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 34 Sources of Cash Flows   Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Cash provided (used) by operating activities $ 44  $ (14) Cash provided (used) by investing activities (50) 652  Cash provided (used) by financing activities (69) (79) Capital expenditures (61) (60) Operating Cash Flows:
The increase in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to the higher net income attributable to Adient for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, partially offset by overall unfavorable changes to working capital year-over-year. Investing Cash Flows:
The decrease in cash provided by investing activities is primarily attributable to prior year cash flow activities including the $651 million of proceeds received related to the 2021 Yanfeng Transaction, $46 million in proceeds received from the sale of the assets in Turkey, and the collection of $41 million of deferred proceeds from the sale of Adient's interest in YFAI as part of the 2020 Yanfeng Transaction. Refer to Note 3, “Acquisitions and Divestitures,” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Financing Cash Flows:
The decrease in cash used by financing activities is attributable to lower dividend payments to noncontrolling interests,
partially offset by $7 million of debt financing costs associated with the extension of the ABL Credit Facility. Refer to Note 8, “Debt and Financing Arrangements,” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Capital expenditures:
Capital expenditures during the first three months of fiscal 2023 were fairly consistent with those during the first three months of fiscal 2022. Working capital (in millions) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Current assets $ 4,087  $ 4,163  Current liabilities 3,418  3,501  Working capital $ 669  $ 662  Working capital was fairly consistent year over year as a decrease in accounts receivable was offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued compensation and benefits.
Restructuring Costs During fiscal 2023, Adient committed to a restructuring plan ("2023 Plan") of $7 million. The restructuring actions relate to cost reduction initiatives and consist primarily of workforce reductions in EMEA. Adient currently estimates that upon completion of the restructuring actions, the fiscal 2023 restructuring plan will reduce annual operating costs by approximately $4 million, which is primarily the result of lower costs of sales due to reduced employee-related costs, of which approximately 10% will result in net savings. The restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by fiscal 2026.
Adient's restructuring plans include workforce reductions of approximately 14,000 employees. Restructuring charges associated with employee severance and termination benefits are paid over the severance period granted to each employee or on a lump sum basis in accordance with individual severance agreements. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 12,000 of the employees have been separated from Adient pursuant to the restructuring plans. In addition, the restructuring plans included twenty-seven plant closures. As of December 31, 2022, twenty-one of the twenty-seven plants have been closed. Adient's management closely monitors its overall cost structure and continually analyzes each of its businesses for opportunities to consolidate current operations, improve operating efficiencies and locate facilities in low cost countries in close proximity to customers. This ongoing analysis includes a review of its manufacturing, engineering, purchasing and administrative functions, as well as the overall global footprint for all its businesses. Because of the importance of new vehicle sales by major automotive manufacturers to operations, Adient is affected by the general business conditions in the automotive industry. Future adverse
Adient plc | Form 10-Q | 35 developments in the automotive industry could impact Adient's liquidity position, lead to impairment charges and/or require additional restructuring of its operations. Repurchases of Equity Securities In November 2022, Adient’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of the Company’s ordinary shares up to an aggregate purchase price of $600 million with no expiration date. Under the share repurchase authorization, Adient’s ordinary shares may be purchased either through discretionary purchases on the open market, by block trades or privately negotiated transactions. The number of ordinary shares repurchased, if any, and the timing of repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including share price, trading volume and general market conditions, as well as on working capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors. No shares were repurchased under the program during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Adient enters into supply chain financing programs in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions to either sell or discount accounts receivable without recourse to third-party institutions. Sales or discounts of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the consolidated statements of financial position and the proceeds are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, $181 million has been funded under these programs compared to $269 million as of September 30, 2022. Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices The effects of inflation have historically not been significant to Adient's results of operations. Generally, Adient has been able to implement operating efficiencies to sufficiently offset cost increases, which over time have been moderate. The automotive industry has recently experienced a period of significant volatility in commodity and other input costs, including steel, petrochemical, freight energy and labor costs. This price volatility may continue into the future as demand increases and/or supply remains constrained. Price volatility has resulted in an overall increase of input costs for Adient that may not be, or may only be partially, offset through customer negotiations.
