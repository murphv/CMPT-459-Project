Note A— Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Delta Apparel, Inc. (collectively with DTG2Go, LLC, Salt Life, LLC, M.J. Soffe, LLC, and other subsidiaries, "Delta Apparel," "we," "us," "our," or the "Company") is
a vertically-integrated, international apparel company with approximately
8,500   employees worldwide. We design, manufacture,   source, and market a diverse portfolio
of core activewear and lifestyle apparel products under our primary brands of Salt Life®, Soffe®, and Delta. We are a   market leader in the on-demand, digital print and
fulfillment industry,   bringing DTG2Go's proprietary   technology and innovation   to our customers'   supply chains.   We   specialize in selling   casual and   athletic products
through a variety of distribution   channels and tiers, including outdoor   and sporting goods retailers,   independent and specialty stores,   better department stores and mid-tier
retailers, mass merchants, eRetailers, the U.S.   military, and through our   business-to-business digital platform. Our products are also   made available direct-to-consumer
on our ecommerce sites   and in our   branded retail stores.   Our diversified go-to-market   strategy allows us   to capitalize on   our strengths in providing   activewear and lifestyle
apparel products to a broad and evolving customer base whose   shopping preferences may span multiple retail channels.   We design and internally manufacture the majority   of our products, with more   than 90% of the apparel   units that we sell sewn   in our own facilities.   This allows us to   offer
a high degree of   consistency and quality, leverage   scale efficiencies, and react quickly   to changes in trends within the   marketplace. We have   manufacturing operations
located in   the United   States, El   Salvador, Honduras,   and Mexico,   and we   use domestic   and foreign   contractors as   additional sources   of production.   Our distribution
facilities are strategically located throughout the United States to better serve our customers with same-day shipping on our catalog products and weekly   replenishments
to retailers. We   were incorporated in Georgia in 1999, and   our headquarters is located in Duluth, Georgia.   Our common stock trades on the NYSE   American under the
symbol “DLA."
We operate on a   52-53 week   fiscal year   ending on   the Saturday   closest to   September 30.   Our 2023 fiscal   year is   a 52-week   year and   will end   on September   30, 2023 ("fiscal
2023"). Accordingly, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q presents our results for our first quarter of fiscal 2023. Our 2022 fiscal year was a 52-week year and ended on
October 1, 2022 ("fiscal 2022").
For presentation purposes herein, all references to period   ended relate to the following fiscal years and dates:   Period Ended

Fiscal 2023
December 31, 2022   We prepared the accompanying interim Condensed Consolidated   Financial Statements in accordance   with the instructions for Form   10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S- X. Accordingly, they do not include all of   the information and footnotes required   by U.S. generally accepted accounting   principles ("U.S. GAAP") for complete   financial
statements.   We   believe   these   Condensed   Consolidated   Financial   Statements include   all   normal   recurring   adjustments considered   necessary   for   a   fair   presentation.
Operating results for the three months ended December 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for our fiscal 2023. Although our various
product lines are   sold on a   year-round basis,   the demand for   specific products or   styles reflects some   seasonality. By   diversifying our product   lines and go-to-market
strategies over   the years,   we have   reduced the   overall seasonality   of our   business. Consumer   demand for   apparel is   cyclical and   dependent upon   the overall   level of
demand for soft goods, which may or may not coincide with the overall level of discretionary consumer spending. These levels of demand change as regional, domestic
and international economic conditions   change. Therefore, the distribution   of sales by quarter in fiscal   2023 may not be indicative   of the distribution in future   years. These
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be   read in conjunction with the   audited Consolidated Financial Statements and   footnotes included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal 2022, filed with the United   States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Delta   Apparel and its wholly-owned and majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries.
We apply the equity method of accounting for our investment   in
31 % of the outstanding capital stock   of a Honduran company. During the three months ended December
2022 and December 2021, we received dividends   from this investment of $ 0.9   million and $ 0.6   million, respectively. Our Ceiba Textiles manufacturing facility is leased
under   an   operating   lease   arrangement with   this   Honduran   company.   During   the   three   months   ended   December   2022   and   December   2021, we   paid   approximately
$ 0.4   million under this arrangement.     We make   available copies of materials we file   with, or furnish to, the SEC free   of charge at https://ir.deltaapparelinc.com.   The information found on our website is   not
part of this, or any   other, report that we   file with, or furnish to,   the SEC. In addition, we   will provide upon request, at no   cost, paper or electronic copies of our   reports
and other filings   made with the   SEC. Requests should be   directed to: Investor   Relations Department, Delta   Apparel, Inc., 2750 Premiere   Parkway, Suite   100, Duluth,
Georgia 30097. Requests can also be made by telephone to 864-232-5200,   or via email at investor.relations@deltaapparel.com.   Note B—Accounting Policies
Our accounting policies are consistent with those described   in our Significant Accounting Policies in our Annual   Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal 2022, filed with   the
SEC. See Note C for consideration of recently issued   accounting standards. Note C—New Accounting Standards
Standards Not Yet Adopted
In June 2016, the FASB   issued ASU No. 2016-13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses   (Topic 326):   Measurement of Credit   Losses on Financial Instruments
(“ASU
2016-13”), which requires an entity to assess impairment of its   financial instruments based on the entity's estimate of expected credit losses. Since the   issuance of ASU
2016-13, the FASB released several amendments   to improve and clarify   the implementation guidance. These   standards have been collectively   codified within ASC Topic
326,
Credit Losses
(“ASC 326”). As a smaller reporting company as defined by   the SEC, the provisions of ASC 326 are effective   as of the beginning of our fiscal year
2024. We are currently evaluating the impacts of the provisions of ASC 326 on our financial condition,   results of operations, cash flows, and disclosures.

Credit Facility
On May 10, 2016,   we entered into   a Fifth Amended   and Restated Credit Agreement   (as further amended,   the “Amended Credit   Agreement”) with Wells   Fargo Bank,
National Association   (“Wells Fargo”), as Administrative   Agent, the Sole   Lead Arranger and   the Sole   Book Runner, and   the financial   institutions named   therein as Lenders,
which are Wells Fargo,   PNC Bank,   and Regions   Bank. Our   subsidiaries M.J.   Soffe, LLC, Culver   City Clothing   Company, Salt Life,   LLC, and   DTG2Go, LLC   (collectively,
the "Borrowers"), are co-borrowers under   the Amended Credit Agreement.   The Borrowers entered into amendments   to the Amended Credit Agreement   with Wells Fargo
and the other lenders on November 27, 2017, March 9, 2018, October   8, 2018, November 19, 2019, April 27, 2020, and August   28, 2020.
On June 2, 2022, the Borrowers entered into a Seventh Amendment to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank (the “Agent”) and the
other lenders   set forth   therein (the   “Seventh Amendment”).   The Seventh   Amendment, (i)   removes LIBOR   based borrowing   and utilizes   SOFR (Secured   Overnight
Financing Rate) as the primary pricing structure, (ii) amends the   pricing structure based on SOFR plus a CSA (Credit Spread Adjustment)   defined as
10   bps for 1 month
and
15   bps for   3-month tenors, (iii)   sets the   SOFR floor to
0   bps, (iv)   reloads the fair   market value of   real estate and   intellectual property within   the borrowing base
calculation and resets their respective amortization schedules, (v) sets   the maturity date to
5   years from the closing date, and   (vi) updates the requirement for our Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio (“FCCR”) for the preceding 12-month period   must not be less than
1.0   (previously
1.1 ).
The Amended Credit Agreement allows us to borrow   up to $ 170   million (subject to borrowing base limitations), including   a maximum of $ 25   million in letters of credit.
Provided that no event of default exists,   we have the option to increase the   maximum credit to $ 200   million (subject to borrowing base limitations),   conditioned upon the
Administrative Agent's ability to secure   additional commitments and customary closing conditions. The   Amended Credit Agreement contains a   subjective acceleration
clause and a “springing” lockbox arrangement (as defined   in ASC 470, Debt ("ASC 470")) whereby   remittances from customers will be forwarded to our general   bank
account and   will not   reduce the outstanding   debt until   and unless   a specified event   or an   event of   default occurs. We   classify borrowings under   the Amended   Credit
Agreement as long-term debt with consideration of current   maturities.
As of December 2022, we had   $ 142.3   million outstanding under our U.S. revolving credit facility   at an average interest rate of
6.7 %. Our cash on hand combined with
the availability under the   U.S. credit facility totaled $ 27.2   million. At December 2022 and September 2022, there was $ 23.1   million and $ 24.9   million, respectively, of
retained earnings free of restrictions to make cash dividends   or stock repurchases.
See Note P—Subsequent Events for a discussion of the Eighth and Ninth Amendments to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement entered into on January 3,
2023, and February 3, 2023, respectively.

Honduran Debt
Since March 2011, we have   entered into term loans and a   revolving credit facility with Banco Ficohsa, a   Honduran bank, to finance investments in both   the operations
and capital expansion of our   Honduran facilities. In December 2020, we   entered into a new term   loan and revolving credit facility with   Banco Ficohsa, both with
five - year terms, and   simultaneously settled   the prior term   loans and revolving   credit facility with   outstanding balances   at the time   of settlement of   $ 1.1   million and   $ 9.5   million,
respectively. Additionally, in May 2022, we entered   into a new term   loan with a
five -year term with a   principal amount of $ 3.7   million. These loans are   secured by a first- priority lien on the assets of our Honduran operations and are not guaranteed by our U.S. entities.   These loans are denominated in U.S. dollars, and the carrying value of
the debt approximates its fair value. As the revolving   credit facility permits us to re-borrow funds up   to the amount repaid, subject to certain   objective covenants, and we
intend to re-borrow funds, subject to those covenants,   the amounts borrowed are classified as long-term debt.   El Salvador Debt
In September 2022, we entered into   a new term loan with   a
five -year term with a principal amount of   $ 3.0   million with Banco Ficohsa, a Panamanian   bank, to finance
investments in our   El Salvador operations.   This loan is secured   by a first-priority lien   on the assets   of our El Salvador   operations and is   not guaranteed by   our U.S. entities.
The loan is   denominated in U.S.   dollars, and the   carrying value of   the debt approximates   its fair value.   Information about this   loan and   the outstanding balance   as of
December 2022 is listed as part of the long-term debt schedule   above.
Additional information about these loans and the outstanding balances   as of December 2022 is as follows (in thousands):   December 2022

2,878   Note G—Selling, General and Administrative Expense
We include in selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses the costs incurred subsequent to the receipt of finished goods at our distribution facilities, such as
the cost of stocking,   warehousing, picking, packing,   and shipping goods for   delivery to our customers.   Distribution costs included in   SG&A expenses totaled   $ 5.4   million
and $ 5.5   million for the December 2022 and December 2021 quarters, respectively. In addition, SG&A expenses include costs related to sales associates, administrative
personnel, advertising and marketing expenses, retail store   build-outs, and other general and administrative expenses. Note H—Stock-Based Compensation
On February 6, 2020, our shareholders approved the Delta Apparel, Inc. 2020 Stock Plan ("2020   Stock Plan") to replace the 2010 Stock Plan,   which was previously re- approved by our shareholders on February 4, 2015,   and was scheduled to expire by its terms   on September 14, 2020. The 2020 Stock Plan is substantially   similar in both
form and substance to the 2010 Stock   Plan. The purpose of the 2020 Stock   Plan is to continue to give our Board   of Directors and its Compensation Committee   the ability
to offer a variety of compensatory awards designed to enhance the Company’s long-term success by encouraging stock ownership among its executives, key employees
and directors. Under the 2020 Stock Plan,   the Compensation Committee of our Board of   Directors has the authority to determine the   employees and directors to whom
awards may be granted, and   the size and type of   each award and manner in   which such awards will vest. The   awards available under the plan   consist of stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted   stock units, performance stock, stock performance   units, and other stock and   cash awards. Unvested awards, while
employed by the Company or serving as a director, become fully vested under certain circumstances as defined in the 2020 Stock   Plan. Such circumstances include, but
are not limited to, the   participant’s death or disability. The Compensation Committee   is authorized to establish the   terms and conditions of awards   granted under the 2020
Stock Plan, to   establish, amend and   rescind any rules   and regulations relating   to the 2020   Stock Plan, and   to make any   other determinations   that it deems   necessary. Similar
to the 2010   Stock Plan, the 2020   Stock Plan limits the   number of shares that   may be covered by   awards to any participant   in a given   calendar year and also   limits the
aggregate awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock granted in a given calendar year. Shares are generally issued from treasury stock upon
the vesting of the restricted stock units, performance units   or other awards under the 2020 Stock Plan.
Compensation expense is   recorded within SG&A   in our   Condensed Consolidated Statements   of Operations   over the   vesting periods.   During the   December 2022 and
December 2021 quarters,   we recognized $ 0.5   million and $ 0.4   million in stock-based   compensation expense, respectively.   Associated with this   compensation cost are
income tax benefits recognized of $ 0.2   million and $ 0.1   million, respectively, for each of the three-month periods ended December 2022 and   December 2021.
During the December 2022 quarter, restricted stock   units representing
105,000   shares of our common stock   vested with the filing of   our Annual Report on Form   10-K for
fiscal 2022 and were issued in accordance with their respective   agreements. Of these vested awards, all were payable in   common stock.   During the   December 2022 quarter,   performance stock units   and restricted stock   units representing 5,000   and 18,000   shares of our   common stock, respectively,   were
forfeited.
As of December   2022, there was $ 3.3   million of total   unrecognized compensation cost   related to unvested   awards granted under   the 2020 Stock   Plan. This cost   is expected
to be recognized over a period of
1.9   years. Note I—Purchase Contracts

Note J—Business Segments
Our operations are managed and reported in
two   segments, Delta Group and Salt Life Group, which reflect the manner in which   the business is managed, and results are
reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker.   The Delta Group is comprised of the following business   units, which are primarily focused on core activewear styles:   DTG2Go and Delta Activewear.   DTG2Go is a   market leader in the   on-demand, direct-to-garment digital print   and fulfillment industry,   bringing technology and innovation   to the supply   chains of our
many customers. Our ‘On-Demand DC’ digital solution provides retailers   and brands with immediate access to utilize DTG2Go’s broad network of print and fulfillment
facilities, while offering   the scalability to integrate   digital fulfillment within the   customer's own distribution facilities.   We use   highly-automated factory processes and
our proprietary software to deliver on-demand,   digitally printed apparel direct to   consumers on behalf of our customers.   Via our multi-facility fulfillment footprint across
the United States, DTG2Go offers   a robust digital supply chain   shipping custom graphic products   within 24 to 48 hours   to consumers in the United   States and to over   100
countries worldwide. DTG2Go has made significant investments in its “digital first” retail model providing digital graphic prints that meet the high-quality standards of
brands, retailers and intellectual property holders.   Through integration with Delta Activewear, DTG2Go also services   the eRetailer, ad-specialty, promotional and screen
print marketplaces, among others.   Delta Activewear is a preferred supplier of   activewear apparel to regional and global   brands as well as direct to retail and   wholesale markets. The Activewear business   is
organized around three key customer   channels – Delta Direct, Global   Brands, and Retail Direct –   that are distinct in their   go-to-market strategies and how   their respective
customer bases   source their   various apparel   needs. Our   Delta Direct   channel services   the screen   print, promotional,   and eRetailer   markets as   well as   retail licensing
customers that sell through to many mid-tier and mass market retailers. Delta Direct products include a broad portfolio of apparel and accessories under the Delta, Delta
Platinum, and Soffe   brands as well   as sourced   items from   select third   party brands.   Our fashion   basics line   includes our Platinum   Collection, which   offers fresh, fashionable
silhouettes with a luxurious look and feel,   as well as versatile fleece offerings.   We offer innovative   apparel products, including the Delta Dri line of   performance shirts
built with moisture-wicking material   to keep athletes dry   and comfortable; ringspun   garments with superior   comfort, style and durability;   and Delta Soft, a   collection with
an incredible feel and price. We also offer our heritage, mid-   and heavier-weight Delta Pro Weight® and Magnum Weight® tee shirts.   The iconic Soffe brand offers activewear for spirit   makers and record breakers and   is widely known for the original "cheer   short" with the signature roll-down waistband.
Soffe carries a wide range of activewear for the entire family. Soffe's heritage is anchored in the military, and we continue to be a proud supplier to both active duty and
veteran United States   military personnel worldwide.   The Soffe men's assortment   features the tagline   "anchored in the military, grounded   in training" and   offers everything
from physical training   gear certified by   the respective branches of   the military,   classic base layers   that include the   favored 3-pack tees,   and the iconic   "ranger panty."
Complementing the Delta and Soffe   brand apparel, we offer   customers a broad range of   nationally recognized branded products including polos,   outerwear, headwear,
bags and other accessories. Our Soffe products are also available   direct to consumers at
www.soffe.com .   Our Global   Brands channel   serves as a   key supply chain   partner to   large multi-national   brands, major branded   sportswear companies, trendy   regional brands, and   all
branches of the United States armed forces,   providing services ranging from custom product development   to the shipment of branded products with “retail-ready”   value- added services including embellishment, hangtags, and   ticketing.   Our Retail Direct   channel serves brick   and mortar and   online retailers by   providing our portfolio   of Delta, Delta   Platinum, and   Soffe products directly   to the retail   locations
and   ecommerce fulfillment   centers of   a   diversified customer   base including   sporting goods   and   outdoor retailers,   specialty and   resort shops,   farm and   fleet   stores,
department stores, and   mid-tier and mass   retailers. As a   key element of   the integrated Delta   Group segment, each   of Activewear’s   primary channels offer   a seamless
solution for replenishment strategies, small-run decoration   needs, and quick reaction programs with on-demand digital   print services, powered by DTG2Go.   The Salt Life Group is   comprised of our Salt Life business, which   is built on the authentic, aspirational Salt Life   lifestyle brand that represents a passion for   the ocean,
the salt air, and, more importantly, a way of life and all it offers, from surfing, fishing, and diving to beach fun and sun-soaked relaxation. The Salt Life brand combines
function and fashion with a tailored fit for the active lifestyles of those that “live the Salt Life.” With increased worldwide appeal, Salt Life has continued to provide the
cotton graphic tees and logo decals that originally   drove awareness for the brand, and expanded   into performance apparel, swimwear, board shorts, sunglasses, bags,   and
accessories. Consumers can also seamlessly experience the Salt Life   brand through retail partners including surf shops, specialty stores,   department stores, and outdoor
merchants or by accessing our Salt Life ecommerce site   at
www.saltlife.com .   Our Chief Operating Decision Maker and management evaluate performance   and allocate resources based on profit or loss from operations before   interest, income taxes
and special charges ("segment operating earnings").   Our segment operating earnings may not be   comparable to similarly titled measures used   by other companies. The
accounting policies   of our   reportable segments   are the   same as   those described   in Note   2 in   our Annual   Report on   Form 10-K   for fiscal   2022, filed   with the   SEC.
Intercompany transfers   between operating   segments are   transacted   at   cost and   have been   eliminated within   the   segment amounts   shown in   the   following table   (in

4,318   Note K—Income Taxes
The Tax   Cuts and Jobs   Act of 2017   (the “2017 Tax   Legislation”) enacted on December 22,   2017, significantly revised the   U.S. corporate income tax   code by,   among
other things, lowering   federal corporate income   tax rates,   implementing a modified   territorial tax   system and imposing   a repatriation tax ("transition   tax") on deemed
repatriated cumulative earnings of foreign subsidiaries   which will be paid over   eight years. In addition, new   taxes were imposed related to   foreign income, including a
tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) as well as a limitation on the deduction for business interest expense (“Section 163(j)"). GILTI is the excess of the
shareholder’s net controlled foreign corporations   ("CFC") net tested income over   the net deemed tangible income.   GILTI income is eligible for a deduction of   up to 50%
of the income inclusion,   but the deduction is   limited to the amount   of U.S. adjusted   taxable income.   The Section 163(j) limitation   does not allow   the amount of deductible
interest to   exceed the   sum of the   taxpayer's business interest   income and 30%   of the   taxpayer’s adjusted   taxable income. We   have included in   our calculation of   our
effective tax rate the estimated impact of   GILTI and Section   163(j). In addition, we have elected to account   for the tax on GILTI   as a period cost and, therefore, do   not
record deferred taxes related to GILTI on our foreign subsidiaries.
Our effective income tax rate on operations for the three-months   ended December 2022 was
35.0 % compared to a rate of
15.1 % in the same period of the prior year, and
an effective rate of
17.9 % for fiscal 2022. We   generally benefit from having income in   foreign jurisdictions that are either exempt   from income taxes or have tax   rates
that are lower than those   in the United States.   As such, changes in the   mix of U.S. taxable income compared   to profits in tax-free or   lower-tax jurisdictions can have a
significant impact on our overall effective tax rate. Note L—Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements
From time to time, we may use interest rate swaps or other instruments to manage our interest rate exposure and reduce the impact of future interest rate changes. These
financial instruments are   not used   for trading   or speculative purposes.   We   have designated   our interest   rate swap   contracts as   cash flow   hedges of   our future   interest
payments. As a result, the gains   and losses on the swap contracts   are reported as a component   of other comprehensive income and are   reclassified into interest expense as
the related interest payments   are made. As of December   2022, all of our other   comprehensive income was attributable   to shareholders; none related to   the non-controlling
interest.   Outstanding instruments as of December 2022 are as follows:   Effective Date
Notional Amount
Fixed LIBOR   Rate
Maturity Date

141   From time to time, we may purchase   cotton option contracts to economically   hedge the risk related to market fluctuations   in the cost of cotton used in   our operations. We
do not receive hedge accounting   treatment for these derivatives. As such,   the realized and unrealized gains and   losses associated with them are   recorded within cost of
goods sold on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.   No such cotton contracts were outstanding at December   2022 and September 2022.
ASC 820, Fair Value   Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC   820”), defines fair value,   establishes a framework for measuring   fair value and expands   disclosures about
fair value measurements.   Assets and liabilities measured   at fair value   are grouped in   three levels. The   levels prioritize the   inputs used to   measure the fair value   of the
assets or liabilities. These levels are:
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for   identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Inputs other   than quoted prices that are   observable for assets and   liabilities, either directly or indirectly. These   inputs include quoted prices for   similar
assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for   identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are less active.
Level 3 – Unobservable   inputs that are supported   by little or no market   activity for assets or   liabilities and includes certain   pricing models, discounted   cash flow
methodologies and similar techniques.

adjusted for our credit   risk, which fall in   Level 2 of the   fair value hierarchy.   At December 2022 and September 2022,   book value for fixed rate   debt approximated   fair
value based on quoted   market prices for the   same or similar issues   or on the current   rates offered to   us for debt of   the same remaining   maturities (a Level 2   fair value
measurement).   Note M—Legal Proceedings
At times,   we are   party to various   legal claims,   actions and   complaints. We believe   that, as   a result   of legal   defenses, insurance   arrangements, and   indemnification provisions
with parties believed to be financially capable, such actions   should not have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial   condition, or liquidity. Note N—Repurchase of Common Stock
As of September 28, 2019,   our Board of   Directors authorized management to   use up to   $ 60.0   million to repurchase stock   in open market   transactions under our Stock
Repurchase   Program. We   did
no t   purchase   any   shares   of   our   common   stock   during   the   December   2022   quarter.   Through   December   2022, we   have   purchased
3,735,114   shares of   our common   stock for   an aggregate   of $ 56.4   million under   our Stock   Repurchase Program   since its   inception. All   purchases were   made at   the discretion
of management and pursuant   to the safe harbor provisions   of SEC Rule 10b-18.   As of December 2022, $ 3.6   million remained available for future   purchases under our
Stock Repurchase Program, which does not have an expiration   date. Note O—Goodwill and Intangible Assets

include $ 18.0   million of goodwill, and the Salt Life Group segment assets   include $ 19.9   million.
Depending on the type   of intangible asset, amortization is   recorded under cost of goods   sold or selling, general and   administrative expenses. Amortization expense for
intangible   assets   for   the   December   2022   and   December   2021   quarters   was   $ 0.6   million   and   $ 0.6   million,   respectively.   Amortization   expense   is   estimated   to   be
approximately $ 1.4   million for the year ended September 2023,   approximately $ 1.4   million for the year ended September 2024,   and approximately $ 1.4   million for the
years ended September 2025, 2026, and 2027. Note P—Subsequent Events
On January 3, 2023, Delta Apparel, Inc. and its   subsidiaries, M.J. Soffe, LLC, Culver City Clothing Company (f/k/a Junkfood Clothing Company), Salt Life,   LLC, and
DTG2Go, LLC (f/k/a Art   Gun, LLC) (collectively, the “Borrowers”)   entered into an Eighth   Amendment to the Fifth   Amended and Restated Credit   Agreement with Wells
Fargo Bank (the   “Agent”) and   the other lenders   set forth therein   (the “Eighth   Amendment”). The Eighth   Amendment essentially   clarifies the Amended   Credit Agreement’s
provisions regarding the inclusion of eligible in-transit inventory in the borrowing base and amends the definition of Increased Reporting Event to include 12.5% of the
lesser of the borrowing base and the maximum revolver   amount as opposed to 12.5% of the line cap.   On February 3, 2023, the   Borrowers entered into a Ninth   Amendment to the Fifth   Amended and Restated Credit   Agreement with the Agent and   the other lenders set forth
therein (the “Ninth Amendment”). The Ninth Amendment adds an Accommodation Period beginning on the amendment date and continuing through the date following
September 30, 2023, upon which Borrowers satisfy minimum availability thresholds and during which: (i)   the minimum borrowing availability thresholds applicable to
the Amended Credit   Agreement are (a)   through (and including)   April 1, 2023,   $ 7,500,000 , (b) on   and after April   2, 2023 through   (and including) June   4, 2023, $ 9,000,000 ,
(c) on and after June 5, 2023, through   the date following September 30, 2023,   upon which Borrowers satisfy minimum availability   thresholds, $ 10,000,000 ; and (d) at all
14
times thereafter, $ 0 ; (ii) the Fixed   Charge Coverage Ratio (“FCCR”)   covenant is suspended;   (iii) Borrowers must   maintain specified minimum   EBITDA levels for   trailing
three-month periods starting March 4, 2023; (iv) the Applicable Margin with respect to loans under the Amended Credit Agreement is increased by
50   basis points; and
(v) a Cash Dominion   Trigger Event occurs if   availability is less   than $ 2,000,000 .   The Ninth Amendment   also, among other   things, (i) amends   the FILO maximum   amount
calculation by reloading
5 % of eligible accounts receivable (capped at $ 3,000,000 ) and deferring the applicable amortization schedules to August 1, 2023; (ii) defers   the
monthly amortization payments for   real estate, machinery   and equipment, and intellectual   property assets to August   1, 2023; (iii) requires weekly   reporting of availability
through the date following   September   30, 2023, upon which   Borrowers satisfy minimum availability thresholds;   and (iv) prohibits certain   restricted payments through
the date following September 30, 2023, upon which Borrowers   satisfy minimum availability thresholds.   The foregoing summary of the Eighth and Ninth Amendments and the   transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified   in its entirety
by reference to the text of the   Eighth and Ninth Amendments, which are filed herewith as   Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to this   Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and which are
incorporated herein by reference.   We   expect the Eighth   and Ninth Amendments will   enhance our borrowing base   and allow us to   access more of our   availability under the Amended   Credit Agreement
while easing the financial covenant restrictions for the remainder   of fiscal 2023.
See Part II, Item 5. Other Information for additional   detail regarding the Ninth Amendment.

● our ability to attract and retain key management;
● the volatility and uncertainty of energy, fuel and related costs;
● material disruptions in our information systems related to our   business operations;
● compromises of our data security;
● significant changes in our effective tax rate;
● significant litigation in either domestic or international jurisdictions;
● recalls, claims and negative publicity associated with product   liability issues;
● the ability to protect our trademarks and other intellectual   property;
● changes in international trade regulations;
● our ability to comply with trade regulations;
● changes in employment laws or regulations or our relationship   with employees; or our ability to attract and retain   employees;
● negative publicity   resulting from violations   of manufacturing standards   or labor   laws or   unethical business practices   by our   suppliers or independent
contractors;
● the inability of suppliers or other third-parties, including those providing key equipment, transportation, and other services, to perform their obligations
or fulfill the terms of their contracts with us;
● restrictions on our ability to borrow capital or service our   indebtedness;
● interest rate fluctuations increasing our obligations under our   variable rate indebtedness;
● the ability to raise additional capital;
● the impairment of acquired intangible assets;
● foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
● the illiquidity of our shares; and
● price volatility in our shares and the general volatility of the stock   market.
A detailed discussion   of significant risk   factors that have   the potential to   cause actual results   to differ materially   from our expectations is   set forth in   Part 1 under   the
subheading "Risk Factors" in our   Annual Report on Form 10-K   for fiscal 2022, filed with   the SEC. Any forward-looking statements   in this Quarterly Report on   Form 10- Q do not purport to be predictions   of future events or circumstances and   may not be realized.

Business Outlook
We were pleased to start our 2023 fiscal year   with double-digit sales growth across   four of our five go-to-market   channels, including record sales   and almost 20% growth
in our DTG2Go   digital print channel   as well as   record sales   and 17% growth   in our Salt   Life lifestyle   brand channel.   Our topline performance   this quarter   further illustrates
the resiliency of our multi-pronged business   model, which allowed us to overcome   the soft demand for basic   tees impacting the mass retail supply   chain and our Delta
Direct channel for the last several quarters.   The   milestone   sales   in   our   Delta   Group   segment’s   DTG2Go   channel   highlight the   market’s   growing   interest in   our   digital   print   and   fulfillment   strategies and   its
appreciation for the reduced working capital   investment; lower inventory risk; faster order-to-porch   cycle; replenishment and quick activation   capability; unlimited color
and design choice; and other   benefits they provide. DTG2Go continues   to effectively leverage two very   unique advantages that differentiate   it in the market   – a multi- facility footprint facilitating one-to-two day shipping speed to 99% of United States consumers and priority access to our Delta Direct channel’s   low-cost vertical blank
tee and   fleece supply.   DTG2Go’s “Digital   First” strategy continues   to generate substantial   new customer demand   and we are   encouraged with the   productivity gains
achieved on the new technology. Further improvements in   machine efficiency, quality and production rates are   necessary for us to realize our long-term   objectives in this
business.   Our Delta Group segment’s Global Brands channel delivered double-digit sales growth for the quarter and continues to add value to the supply chains of multi-national,
regional and major sportswear brands and the United States armed forces as a preferred supplier of custom decorated products. We also achieved double-digit growth in
our Delta   Group segment’s   Retail Direct   channel where   we provide   decorated and   “retail ready”   products directly   to the   brick and   mortar locations   and eCommerce
fulfillment centers of sporting goods and outdoor retailers,   farm and fleet stores, department stores, and mid-tier   and mass retailers.   The growth in our   Global Brands and   Retail Direct channels was   accelerated by new   business resulting from   the Activewear industry’s burgeoning emphasis   on nearshore
sourcing strategies like those offered   by our vertical platform in   Central America coupled with our   ability to meet the service   and compliance requirements of the   world’s
leading brands and   retailers.   We expect   the focus on   U.S. proximity sourcing strategies   to continue and believe   that both of   these channels are positioned   to generate
growth opportunities across our Delta Group segment over   time.
As expected, our Delta Group segment’s   results for the quarter were impacted by   the reduced demand in the mass retail   supply chain and the associated manufacturing
shutdowns that we, like many   across the industry,   initiated to recalibrate output as   well as elevated raw material, energy   and labor costs.   Although the price of cotton,
one of our key raw materials, has moderated from last year’s notable highs, that high-cost cotton continues to flow through our cost of sales due to production cadences
and pressures margins accordingly.   We expect to cycle through most of that higher-priced cotton in our   second quarter and begin to see the benefit of lower input costs
in our results as   we progress through the   second half of our   fiscal year. We   will continue to leverage   the flexibility of our   vertical manufacturing strategy until we   see
better equilibrium between inventories and demand and also focus on opportunities in higher   margin areas of our Delta Direct channel outside   of the mass retail supply
ecosystem.   The momentum in our Salt Life Group segment continues with this quarter’s record sales   and excellent bottom line performance as it moves into its traditionally strong
Spring selling season. The   escalating growth across   Salt Life’s direct-to-consumer retail   and eCommerce channels   should continue as   it expands its brick   and mortar retail
and digital footprints to   keep pace with the   brand’s consumer base   stretching across the country.   Salt Life is targeting   six to eight new   store openings this fiscal   year,
including debut locations   in New   Jersey and Virginia,   bringing its total   store count to   approximately 30 locations   across nine states   spanning the U.S.   coastline from
California to Florida to New Jersey.   Salt Life’s consumer   eCommerce site,   www.saltlife.com, now ships   to all   50 states,   including significant   order flows   to states outside   of the brand’s   traditional southeastern
base, and its wholesale business also continues to expand.   There are now approximately 1,800 customer retail doors across 48 states and foreign countries offering Salt
Life products.   We continue to see a tremendous runway for growth for the Salt Life brand across the United   States and internationally.   Looking ahead, we   will further rely on   the versatility of   our multiple go-to-market   strategies and focus on   organic growth through   both new customer   acquisition and
expansion of existing relationships. We see outstanding opportunities deriving from our investments in DTG2Go’s   digital technology platform and Salt Life’s authentic
lifestyle brand   positioning. Moreover,   we are   now seeing   some welcome   cost stabilization   in our   Delta Group   segment and   expect these   trends to   positively impact
profitability as we progress   throughout the year.   Along the way,   we will continue to   prudently manage our working capital   and expenses while pursuing   opportunities
generated by our diversified business model.
Results of Operations
Financial results included herein have been presented on a generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") basis.
Net sales were $107.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal   2023, a decrease of 3.1% compared to the prior year first quarter net sales   of $110.7 million.     Net sales in the Delta Group segment declined 4.8% to $97.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $101.9 million in the prior year first quarter.
We saw record first quarter sales in our DTG2Go business and   growth in our Global Brands and Retail Direct   channels, offset by diminished demand in the mass
retail supply chain driving reduced sales in our Delta Direct   channel.
The Salt Life Group segment first   quarter fiscal 2023 revenue grew   16.5% to $10.3 million compared to   $8.8 million in the prior year   first quarter. The segment’s
record first quarter sales were driven by growth in both direct-to-consumer   and wholesale channels.     Gross margins were 12.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, declining   810 basis points from the prior year first quarter gross margin of 20.8%.
The Delta Group segment gross margins were 8.0%   for the first quarter of fiscal   2023, a decline of 100 basis points   from the prior year first quarter   margins of
18.0%. Gross margins were primarily impacted   by higher inventory costs from inflationary   raw material and other input pricing   in fiscal 2022 flowing through
sales during the quarter, in addition to $3.4 million in plant curtailment costs.     The Salt Life Group segment gross margins improved to 57.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, an improvement of 370 basis points compared to 53.3% in the
prior year first quarter resulting from a favorable mix   of sales, including increased Salt Life branded retail store   and ecommerce sales.     Selling, general, and administrative expenses ("SG&A") were $18.9 million in the first   quarter of fiscal 2023, or 17.6% of sales, compared to $17.5 million,   or 15.8% of
sales, in the prior year first quarter.   The increase in SG&A expenses of $1.3 million compared to the prior year first quarter   was primarily driven by higher selling costs
driven by our expanded Salt Life retail footprint, in addition   to increased distribution and administrative costs.     Other income for the 2023 and 2022 first fiscal quarters includes   profits related to our Green Valley Industrial Park equity method investment. Additionally, in the first
quarter of fiscal 2023, we recognized a discrete gain of   $2.5 million from the settlement of a commercial litigation matter.
Operating loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2023   was $2.6 million.   This compares to operating income of $5.9 million   in the prior year first fiscal quarter.
17
The Delta Group segment had operating income of $0.1 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2023, or 0.1% of net sales, compared to $8.4 million,   or 8.3% of net
sales, in the   prior year first   quarter. The decrease in   operating profit was   driven by declining   gross margins due   to increased inflationary   costs and plant   curtailment
costs.     The Salt Life Group segment had operating income of $0.3 million in the first fiscal   quarter of 2023, or 2.5% of net sales, compared to $0.1 million,   or 1.5% of
sales, in the prior year first quarter.   The increase in operating profit was driven by higher sales volume and increased gross   margins offset by higher selling and
distribution costs.     Net interest expense for the first quarters of each of fiscal years   2023 and 2022 was $2.9 million and $1.6 million,   respectively.     Our effective tax rate on operations for the three-month period ended December 2022 was 35.0%. This compares   to an effective tax rate of 15.1% for the same period in
the prior year   and 17.9% for   the full fiscal   year 2022. Changes   in the mix   of U.S. taxable   income compared to   profits in tax-free   or lower-tax jurisdictions   drove this
change in our effective tax rate.
Net loss attributable to shareholders for the first fiscal quarter of 2023   was $3.6 million,   or a loss of $0.51 per diluted share, compared to net income of   $3.6 million, or
$0.51 per diluted share, in the prior year.
Accounts receivable were $57.8 million   at December 2022, compared   to $68.2 million as of September   2022. Days sales outstanding ("DSO")   as of December 2022   were
47 days compared to 52 days at September 2022.
Net inventory as of December 2022 was   $258.9 million,   an increase of $10.4 million from September 2022 and   $75.8 million from December 2021. The increase from
September 2022 stemmed primarily from timely Salt Life first   quarter inventory deliveries compared to last year’s supply   chain delays pushing scheduled deliveries into
the second quarter.
Total net debt, including capital lease financing and cash on hand,   was $185.2 million as of December 31, 2022, an increase of $14.6 million from September 2022 and
$39 million from   December 2021. Cash on   hand and availability under   the Company’s   U.S. revolving credit facility   totaled $27.2 million as   of December 31, 2022,   a
decrease of $7.5 million from   September 2022 and $5.8 million from   December 2021, with the increase from   September 2022 principally driven by investments in the
business to support working capital needs.     Liquidity and Capital Resources
Operating Cash Flows
Operating activities resulted in a cash usage   of $11.9 million for the three   months ended December 2022 compared to $13.2   million of cash used in the   prior year. The
improvement in cash used in operating cash flows in the current year are due to the timing of payments from customers and to vendors, in addition to reduced inventory
in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior   year as a result of reduced customer demand.   Investing Cash Flows
Cash outflows for capital expenditures were $2.1 million during the first three months of 2023 compared to $1.8 million in the same period in the prior year. During the
three-months ended June 2022, there were $0.1 million of capital expenditures   financed under a capital lease arrangement. We   currently expect to spend less on capital
expenditures in 2023 as   compared to 2022, with   our expenditures expected to focus   on digital print equipment,   information technology, manufacturing   efficiency, and
direct-to-consumer investments,   including new Salt Life retail store openings.   Financing Activities
During the three months ended December 2022, cash provided by financing   activities was $9.6 million and primarily related to funding   our operating activities, working
capital needs, and certain capital investments offset by scheduled loan   principal payments.
Future Liquidity and Capital Resources
See Note F – Debt to the Condensed   Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion   of our various financing arrangements,   including the terms of our revolving U.S.
credit facility.
Our credit facility, as well as cash flows   from operations, are intended   to fund our day-to-day working   capital needs, and along with   capital lease financing arrangements,
to fund our planned capital expenditures. However,   any material deterioration in our results of   operations may result in the loss   of our ability to borrow under   our U.S.
revolving credit facility and to issue letters of credit to suppliers, or may cause the borrowing availability under that facility to be insufficient for our needs. Availability
under our credit facility is primarily a function of the levels of our accounts receivable and inventory. A significant deterioration in our accounts receivable or inventory
levels could restrict   our ability to   borrow additional funds   or service our   indebtedness. Additionally,   a significant deterioration in our   business results could   cause our
availability to   fall below   minimum thresholds, thereby   requiring us   to maintain   the minimum   FCCR specified in   our credit   agreement, which   we may   not be   able to
maintain. Refer to Item 5. Other Information for   further information regarding our current financial covenants. While   our availability at December 2022 was   above the
minimum thresholds   specified in   our credit   agreement, a   significant deterioration   in our   business could   cause our   availability to   fall below   such thresholds,   thereby
requiring us to maintain the minimum FCCR specified in   our credit agreement.
Share Repurchase Program
The Company did not   purchase any shares under   our previously announced share   repurchase program in the   first quarter of fiscal   2023. The total amount   repurchased
during the life of   the program is $56.4 million.   At the end of   the first quarter of   fiscal 2023, the Company had   $3.6 million of remaining repurchase capacity under   its
existing authorization.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared
in accordance with   U.S. GAAP. The preparation of   our Condensed Consolidated   Financial Statements requires   us to make estimates   and judgments that   affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other   factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for   making judgments about the carrying values   of assets and liabilities that are   not readily apparent from other sources. Actual   results
18
may   differ   from these   estimates under   different   assumptions or   conditions. The   most significant   estimates and   assumptions relate   to   revenue recognition,   accounts
receivable and related reserves, inventory and related reserves,   the carrying value of goodwill, and the accounting for   income taxes.
A   detailed discussion   of   critical   accounting policies   is   contained in   the   Significant   Accounting Policies   included   in   Note 2   to   the   Audited Consolidated   Financial
Statements included in our Annual Report   on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022, and   there have been no changes in those   policies since the filing of that Annual   Report on Form
10-K with the SEC.
Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
We   are subject   to various   federal, state   and local   environmental laws   and regulations   concerning, among   other things,   wastewater discharges,   storm water   flows, air
emissions and   solid waste   disposal. The   labeling, distribution, importation,   marketing, and   sale of   our products   are subject   to extensive   regulation by various   federal
agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Product Safety Commission and state attorneys general in the United States. Our international operations
are also subject to compliance   with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the   “FCPA”) and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations.
The environmental and other regulations applicable to our business are becoming increasingly   stringent, and we incur capital and other expenditures annually to achieve
compliance with these environmental   standards and regulations. We currently do not   expect that the amount of   expenditures required to comply with   these environmental
standards or other regulatory   matters will have   a material adverse   effect on our operations,   financial condition or   liquidity. There can be no   assurance, however, that future
changes in   federal, state,   or   local regulations,   interpretations of   existing regulations   or   the discovery   of   currently unknown   problems or   conditions will   not   require
substantial additional expenditures. Similarly, while we believe that we are currently in   compliance with all applicable environmental and other regulatory requirements,
the extent of   our liability, if any, for past   failures to comply   with laws, regulations   and permits applicable   to our operations   cannot be determined   and could have   a material
adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.
Item 4.   Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures   that are designed to reasonably assure that information   required to be disclosed in the reports that
we file   or submit   under the   Exchange Act   is recorded,   processed, summarized   and reported   within the   time periods   specified in   the SEC’s   requirements. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or
submit under   the   Exchange Act   is   accumulated and   communicated to   our management,   including our   Chief Executive   Officer   and   principal accounting   officer,   as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, with the   participation of our Chief   Executive Officer and principal   accounting officer, has   evaluated the effectiveness of our   disclosure controls and
procedures as   of the   end of   period covered by   this quarterly   report ("the   Evaluation Date") and,   based on   their evaluation,   our Chief   Executive Officer   and principal
accounting officer have concluded that these controls and procedures   were effective as of the Evaluation Date.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes during the December   2022 quarter that have materially affected, or   are reasonably likely to materially affect,   our internal control over   financial
reporting.

Ninth Amendment to the Fifth Amended and Restated   Credit Agreement
On February 3, 2023, Delta Apparel, Inc. and its subsidiaries, M.J. Soffe, LLC,   Culver City Clothing Company (f/k/a Junkfood Clothing Company), Salt Life,   LLC, and
DTG2Go, LLC (f/k/a Art Gun, LLC) (collectively, the “Borrowers”) entered into a Ninth Amendment to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Wells
Fargo Bank (the “Agent”) and the other lenders set forth therein   (“Ninth Amendment”). The Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2016,
was filed as   Exhibit 10.1 to   Delta Apparel’s Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q filed with   the SEC on   May 12, 2016.   The First Amendment   to the Amended   Credit Agreement
was filed as   Exhibit 10.2.5 to   Delta Apparel’s   Annual Report on   Form 10-K filed   with the SEC   on November 28,   2017. The Consent   and Second Amendment   to the
Amended Credit Agreement was filed   as Exhibit 10.1 to   Delta Apparel’s Form 8-K   filed with the SEC   on March 13, 2018.   The Consent and Third Amendment   to the
Amended Credit Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to Delta   Apparel’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on   October 9, 2018. The Consent and Fourth Amendment to the
Amended Credit Agreement   was filed as   Exhibit 10.2.8 to   Delta Apparel's Annual   Report on Form   10-K filed with   the SEC on November   21, 2019. The   Fifth Amendment
to the   Amended Credit   Agreement was   filed   as Exhibit   10.1 to   Delta Apparel’s   Quarterly Report   on   Form 10-Q   filed   with the   SEC on   April 30,   2020.   The Sixth
Amendment to the Amended Credit Agreement was   filed as Exhibit 10.1 to Delta Apparel’s Form 8-K filed with the   SEC on August 31, 2020. The Seventh Amendment
to the Amended Credit Agreement was filed as Exhibit   10.1 to Delta Apparel’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 3, 2022.   The Ninth Amendment adds an   Accommodation Period beginning on the amendment date and   continuing through the date following September 30,   2023, upon which
Borrowers satisfy minimum availability thresholds   and during which: (i)   the minimum borrowing availability thresholds   applicable to the Amended   Credit Agreement
are (a) through (and including) April 1, 2023, $7,500,000,   (b) on and after April 2, 2023 through (and including)   June 4, 2023, $9,000,000, (c) on and after June 5, 2023,
through the date following September 30, 2023, upon which Borrowers satisfy minimum availability thresholds, $10,000,000; and (d) at all   times thereafter, $0; (ii) the
Fixed Charge Coverage   Ratio (“FCCR”)   covenant is   suspended; (iii)   Borrowers must   maintain specified   minimum EBITDA   levels for trailing   three-month periods   starting
March 4, 2023; (iv) the Applicable Margin with respect to loans   under the Amended Credit Agreement is increased by   50 basis points; and (v) a Cash Dominion Trigger
19
Event occurs if availability   is less than $2,000,000.   The Ninth Amendment also,   among other things, (i)   amends the FILO maximum   amount calculation by reloading   5%
of eligible   accounts receivable   (capped at   $3,000,000) and   deferring the   applicable amortization   schedules to   August 1,   2023; (ii)   defers the   monthly amortization   payments
for real   estate, machinery and   equipment, and   intellectual property assets   to August 1,   2023; (iii)   requires weekly reporting   of availability through   the date   following
September 30, 2023, upon which Borrowers   satisfy minimum availability thresholds;   and (iv) prohibits certain restricted payments   through the date following September
30, 2023, upon which Borrowers satisfy minimum availability   thresholds.   We expect the Ninth Amendment will enhance   our borrowing base and allow   us to access more of   our availability under the Amended   Credit Agreement while easing   the
financial covenant restrictions for the remainder of fiscal 2023.
The foregoing summary of the Ninth Amendment and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the text of the Ninth Amendment, which is filed herewith   as Exhibit 10.2 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q   and which is incorporated herein by reference.
Separate from   the relationship   related to   the   Amended Credit   Agreement, as   amended, certain   lenders thereunder   have engaged   in, or   may in   the future   engage in,
