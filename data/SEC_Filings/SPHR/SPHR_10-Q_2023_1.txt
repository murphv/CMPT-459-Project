NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) All amounts included in the following notes to condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) are presented in thousands, except per share data or as otherwise noted. Note 1.  Description of Business and Basis of Presentation Description of Business Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “MSG Entertainment”), is a leader in live entertainment comprised of iconic venues, marquee entertainment brands, regional sports and entertainment networks and popular dining and nightlife offerings. Utilizing the Company’s powerful brands and live entertainment expertise, the Company delivers unique experiences that set the standard for excellence and innovation while forging deep connections with diverse and passionate audiences. The Company is comprised of
three
reportable segments: Entertainment, MSG Networks and Tao Group Hospitality. As of December 31, 2022, there have been no changes to the reportable segments of the Company. See Note 1, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation, to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in the Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 as filed with the SEC on August 19, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) for more information regarding the details of the Company’s business. Basis of Presentation The Company reports on a fiscal year basis ending on June 30 th
(“Fiscal Year”). In these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements (“financial statements”), the years ended on June 30, 2023 and 2022 are referred to as “Fiscal Year 2023” and “Fiscal Year 2022,” respectively. Certain Fiscal Year 2022 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the Fiscal Year 2023 presentation. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions of Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for Fiscal Year 2022 included in the 2022 Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Company, the accompanying financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of its financial position as of December 31, 2022, and its results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, and cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021. The condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes as of Fiscal Year 2023, were derived from audited annual financial statements but do not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements. The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected for future interim periods or for the full year. As a result of the production of the
Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes
(the “ Christmas Spectacular ”), arena license fees in connection with the use of Madison Square Garden (“The Garden”) by the New York Knicks (the “Knicks”) of the National Basketball Association (the “NBA”) and the New York Rangers (the “Rangers”) of the National Hockey League (the “NHL”), and MSG Networks’ advertising revenue being largely derived from the sale of inventory in its live NBA and NHL professional sports programming, the Company generally earns a disproportionate share of its annual revenues in the second and third quarters of its fiscal year. Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic The Company’s operations and operating results were not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period, which was impacted by (i) fewer ticketed events at our performance venues due to the lead-time required to book touring acts and artists, (ii) the postponement or cancellation of select events at our performance venues (including the partial cancellation of the 2021 production of the
Christmas Spectacular) , and a temporary impact to both demand and operations at Tao Group Hospitality as a result of an increase in COVID-19 cases during the fiscal second quarter, and (iii) certain regulatory requirements, including vaccination/mask requirements for our performance, entertainment dining and nightlife venues, which contributed to certain Tao Group Hospitality branded locations remaining closed during the period. See Note 1, Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in the 2022 Form 10-K for more information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. It is unclear to what extent COVID-19 concerns, including with respect to new variants, could result in new government or league-mandated capacity or other restrictions or vaccination/mask requirements or impact the use of and/or demand for our

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) performance, entertainment dining and nightlife venues, demand for our sponsorship and advertising assets, deter our employees and vendors from working at our venues (which may lead to difficulties in staffing) or otherwise materially impact our operations. Note 2.
Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation The financial statements of the Company include the accounts of Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. and its subsidiaries, which include Tao Group Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (“Tao Group Hospitality”) and Boston Calling Events, LLC (“BCE”), until its disposition on December 2, 2022. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial statements of the Company include accounts of Tao Group Hospitality, and BCE (up to December 2, 2022) in which the Company has controlling voting interests. The Company’s consolidation criteria are based on authoritative accounting guidance for identifying a controlling financial interest. Tao Group Hospitality and BCE are consolidated with the equity owned by other stockholders shown as redeemable or nonredeemable noncontrolling interests in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, and the other stockholders’ portion of net earnings (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) shown as net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) attributable to redeemable or nonredeemable noncontrolling interests in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), respectively. The Company disposed of its controlling interest in BCE on December 2, 2022 and these condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations of BCE until its disposition. See Note 3, Dispositions, for details regarding the disposal. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in the 2022 Form 10-K regarding the classification of redeemable noncontrolling interests of Tao Group Hospitality. Use of Estimates The preparation of the accompanying financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the provision for credit losses, valuation of investments, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related net periodic benefit cost, and other liabilities. In addition, estimates are used in revenue recognition, rights fees, performance and share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, litigation matters and other matters, as well as in the valuation of noncontrolling interests resulting from business combination transactions. Management believes its use of estimates in the financial statements to be reasonable. Management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the general economic environment and actions it may take in the future. The Company adjusts such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, these estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on management’s best judgment at a point in time and, as such, these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results. Changes in estimates resulting from weakness in the economic environment or other factors beyond the Company’s control could be material and would be reflected in the Company’s financial statements in future periods. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The following is an update to the Company's Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, disclosed in the 2022 Form 10-K. The update primarily reflects the addition of a policy related to production costs for the Company’s Original Immersive Productions. Production Costs for the Company’s Original Immersive Productions The Company defers certain costs during the production phase of its original immersive productions for MSG Sphere that are directly related to production activities. Such costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to writers, directors, and producers as well as video and music production costs and production specific overhead. Deferred immersive production costs are

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) amortized in the same ratio that current period actual revenue bears to estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenue as of the beginning of the current fiscal year. Estimates of ultimate revenues are prepared on an individual production basis and reviewed regularly by management and revised where necessary to reflect the most current information. Ultimate revenues reflect management’s estimates of future revenue over a period not to exceed ten years following the premiere of the production. Deferred immersive production costs are subject to recoverability assessments whenever there is an indication of potential impairment.

Commitments and Contingencies Commitments See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in the 2022 Form 10-K for details on the Company’s off-balance sheet commitments. The Company’s off-balance sheet commitments as of June 30, 2022 included a total of $ 3,898,281
of contract obligations (primarily related to media rights agreements from the MSG Networks segment). During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any material changes in its non-cancelable contractual obligations (other than activities in the ordinary course of business), except for the execution of the MSG Sphere Term Loan Facility (as defined below) on December 22, 2022. See Note 10, Credit Facilities for details of the principal repayments required under the Company’s various credit facilities, including the MSG Sphere Term Loan Facility. Legal Matters Fifteen
complaints were filed in connection with the Company’s acquisition of MSG Networks Inc. (the “Merger”) by purported stockholders of the Company and MSG Networks Inc. Nine
of these complaints involved allegations of materially incomplete and misleading information set forth in the joint proxy statement/prospectus filed by the Company and MSG Networks Inc. in connection with the Merger. As a result of supplemental disclosures made by the Company and MSG Networks Inc. on July 1, 2021, all of the disclosure actions were voluntarily dismissed with prejudice prior to or shortly following the consummation of the Merger. Six
complaints involved allegations of fiduciary breaches in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger and have since been consolidated into
two
remaining litigations. On September 10, 2021, the Court of Chancery entered an order consolidating
two
derivative complaints filed by purported Company stockholders. The consolidated action is captioned:
In re Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. Stockholders Litigation , C.A. No. 2021-0468-KSJM. The consolidated plaintiffs filed their Verified Consolidated Derivative Complaint on October 11, 2021. The complaint, which names the Company as only a nominal defendant, retains all of the derivative claims and alleges that the members of the board of directors and controlling stockholders violated their fiduciary duties in the course of negotiating and approving the Merger. Plaintiffs seek, among other relief, an award of damages to the Company including interest, and plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. The Company and other defendants filed answers to the complaint on December 30, 2021. The Company substantially completed its production of documents responsive to plaintiffs’ requests on June 24, 2022, and on November 16, 2022, fact discovery closed. The Company continues to be engaged in responding to plaintiffs’ outstanding discovery requests. Pursuant to the indemnity rights in its bylaws and Delaware law, the Company is advancing the costs incurred by defendants in this action, and defendants may assert indemnification rights in respect of any adverse judgment or settlement of the action. On September 27, 2021, the Court of Chancery entered an order consolidating
four
complaints filed by purported stockholders of MSG Networks Inc. The consolidated action is captioned:
In re MSG Networks Inc. Stockholder Class Action Litigation , C.A. No. 2021-0575-KSJM (the “MSG Networks Action”). The consolidated plaintiffs filed their Verified Consolidated Stockholder Class Action Complaint on October 29, 2021. The complaint asserts claims on behalf of a putative class of former MSG Networks Inc. stockholders against each member of the board of directors of MSG Networks Inc. and the controlling stockholders prior to the Merger. Plaintiffs allege that the MSG Networks Inc. board of directors and controlling stockholders breached their fiduciary duties in negotiating and approving the Merger. The Company is not named as a defendant but has been subpoenaed to produce documents and testimony related to the Merger. Plaintiffs seek, among other relief, monetary damages for the putative class and plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. Defendants in the MSG Networks Action filed answers to the complaint on December 30, 2021. The Company substantially completed its production of documents responsive to plaintiffs’ requests on June 24, 2022, and on November 16, 2022 fact discovery closed. The Company continues to be engaged in responding to plaintiffs’ outstanding discovery requests.
Pursuant to the indemnity rights in its bylaws and Delaware law, the
18 MADISON SQUARE GARDEN ENTERTAINMENT CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) Company is advancing the costs incurred by defendants in this action, and defendants may assert indemnification rights in respect of any adverse judgment or settlement of the action. On September 19, 2022, the Court of Chancery approved a case schedule, governing the
two
consolidated actions, which set trial dates for April 2023. On January 3, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted the unopposed motion for class certification in the MSG Networks Action. A joint-mediation session is scheduled for February 11 and 12, 2023. On January 12, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted a stipulation and order dismissing former MSG Networks Inc. directors William Bell, Stephen Mills and Hank Ratner from the MSG Networks Action. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any, with respect to these Merger-related claims. Accordingly, no accrual for these matters has been made in our financial statements. The Company is a defendant in various other lawsuits. Although the outcome of these other lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty (including the extent of available insurance, if any), management does not believe that resolution of these other lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Company.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) The following table summarizes the Company’s share-based compensation expense: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Share-based compensation (a) $ 18,185   $ 24,171   $ 33,373   $ 43,699   Intrinsic value of awards vested (b)      $ 2,995   $ 492   $ 35,127   $ 32,734   _________________ (a) Share-based compensation excludes costs that have been capitalized of $ 1,802
and $ 1,763
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, share-based compensation also excludes costs of $ 2,293
that have been reclassified to Restructuring charges in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, as detailed in Note 5, Restructuring Charges. (b) To fulfill required statutory tax withholding obligations for the applicable income and other employment taxes, RSUs and PSUs with an aggregate value of $ 14,741
and $ 15,652
were retained by the Company during the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The aggregate value of the RSUs and PSUs retained included $ 305
and $ 477
related to MSG Sports employees, during the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, there was $ 106,360
of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs and PSUs held by the Company’s employees. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
1.8
years.
For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, weighted-average anti-dilutive shares primarily consisted of approximately
1,671
units and
1,433
units, respectively, of RSUs and stock options and were excluded in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, weighted-average anti-dilutive shares primarily consisted of approximately
668
units of RSUs and stock options and were excluded in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the six months ended December 31, 2021 all restricted stock units and stock options were excluded from the anti-dilutive calculation because the Company reported a net loss for the period and, therefore, their impact on reported loss per share would have been antidilutive. An anti-dilutive option exists when the average stock price for the period is less than the exercise price of the option or share. Award Activity RSUs During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately
650
and
445
RSUs were granted and approximately
546

and $ 33,149

The Company also earned sublease revenue from related parties of $ 611
and $ 1,222
during the
three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Note 15.  Segment Information As of December 31, 2022, the Company was comprised of
three
reportable segments: Entertainment, MSG Networks and Tao Group Hospitality. The Company takes into account whether two or more operating segments can be aggregated together as one reportable segment as well as the type of discrete financial information that is available and regularly reviewed by its Chief Operating Decision Maker.  The Company incurs non-capitalizable content development and technology costs associated with the Company’s MSG Sphere initiative, which are reported in Entertainment. In addition to event-related operating expenses, Entertainment also includes other expenses such as (a) corporate and supporting department operating costs that are attributable to MSG Sphere development and (b) non-event related operating expenses for the Company’s venues, such as (i) rent for the Company’s leased venues, (ii) real estate taxes, (iii) insurance, (iv) utilities, (v) repairs and maintenance, (vi) labor related to the overall management of the venues, and (vii) depreciation and amortization expense related to the Company’s performance venues and
29 MADISON SQUARE GARDEN ENTERTAINMENT CORP. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued) certain corporate property, equipment and leasehold improvements. Additionally, the Company does not allocate any purchase accounting adjustments related to business acquisitions to the reporting segments. The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, of which the key financial measure is adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure. We define adjusted operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) excluding: (i) the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue associated with the Arena License Agreements with MSG Sports, (ii) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, (iii) amortization for capitalized cloud computing arrangement costs, (iv) share-based compensation expense, (v) restructuring charges or credits, (vi) merger and acquisition-related costs, including litigation expenses, (vii) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses and associated settlements, (viii) the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to business acquisitions, and (ix) gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities under the Company’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (which was established in November 2021). The Company believes that given the length of the Arena License Agreements and resulting magnitude of the difference in leasing revenue recognized and cash revenue received, the exclusion of non-cash leasing revenue provides investors with a clearer picture of the Company's operating performance.
Management believes that this adjustment is beneficial for other incremental reasons as well. This adjustment provides senior management, investors and analysts with important information regarding a long-term related party agreement with MSG Sports. In addition, this adjustment is included under the Company’s debt covenant compliance calculations and is a component of the performance measures used to evaluate, and compensate, senior management of the Company.
The Company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of the Company’s business without regard to the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash. The Company eliminates merger and acquisition-related costs, when applicable, because the Company does not consider such costs to be indicative of the ongoing operating performance of the Company as they result from an event that is of a non-recurring nature, thereby enhancing comparability. In addition, management believes that the exclusion of gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities under the Company’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which were included for the first time in Fiscal Year 2022, provides investors with a clearer picture of the Company’s operating performance given that, in accordance with GAAP, gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities under the Company’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan are recognized in Operating income (loss) whereas gains and losses related to the remeasurement of the assets under the Company’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which are equal to and therefore fully offset the gains and losses related to the remeasurement of liabilities, are recognized in Other income (expense), net, which is not reflected in Operating income (loss). The Company believes adjusted operating income (loss) is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of its business segments and the Company on a consolidated basis. Adjusted operating income (loss) and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors and analysts to analyze the Company’s performance. The Company uses revenues and adjusted operating income (loss) measures as the most important indicators of its business performance, and evaluates management’s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. Adjusted operating income (loss) should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Since adjusted operating income (loss) is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. The Company has presented the components that reconcile operating income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to adjusted operating income (loss). 30 MADISON SQUARE GARDEN ENTERTAINMENT CORP.

All dollar amounts included in the following MD&A are presented in thousands, except as otherwise noted.
Introduction This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company’s unaudited financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the Form 10-K to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations . The Company has three reportable segments (Entertainment, MSG Networks, and Tao Group Hospitality). The Entertainment segment includes the Company’s portfolio of venues: Madison Square Garden (“The Garden”), Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden (“Hulu Theater”), Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, and The Chicago Theatre. In addition, the Company has unveiled its vision for state-of-the-art venues, called MSG Sphere, and is currently building its first such venue in Las Vegas. The Entertainment segment also includes the original production, the
Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes
(the “ Christmas Spectacular ”). This segment also includes our bookings business, which features a variety of live entertainment and sports experiences. The Company also previously owned a controlling interest in Boston Calling Events, LLC (“BCE”), the entertainment production company that owns and operates the Boston Calling Music Festival. The Company disposed of its controlling interest in BCE on December 2, 2022. The MSG Networks segment is comprised of the Company’s regional sports and entertainment networks, MSG Network and MSG+, a companion streaming app, MSG GO, and other digital properties. MSG Networks serves the New York Designated Market Area, as well as other portions of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania and features a wide range of sports content, including live local games and other programming of the New York Knicks (the “Knicks”) of the National Basketball Association (the “NBA”) and the New York Rangers (the “Rangers”), New York Islanders (the “Islanders”), New Jersey Devils (the “Devils”) and Buffalo Sabres (the “Sabres”) of the National Hockey League (the “NHL”), as well as significant coverage of the New York Giants (the “Giants”) and Buffalo Bills (the “Bills”) of the National Football League (the “NFL”). The Tao Group Hospitality segment features the Company’s controlling interest in TAO Group Holdings LLC (“Tao Group Hospitality”), a hospitality group with globally-recognized entertainment dining and nightlife brands including: Tao, Hakkasan, Omnia, Marquee, Lavo, Beauty & Essex, and Cathédrale. Tao Group Hospitality operates over 70 entertainment dining and nightlife branded locations in over 20 markets across four continents. The Company conducts a significant portion of its operations at venues that it either owns or operates under long-term leases. The Company owns The Garden, Hulu Theater and The Chicago Theatre, and leases Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre. Additionally, Tao Group Hospitality operates various restaurants, nightlife and hospitality venues under long-term leases and management contracts in Las Vegas, New York, Southern California, London, Singapore, and various other domestic and international locations. Our MD&A is organized as follows: Results of Operations.
This section provides an analysis of our unaudited results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 on both a (i) consolidated basis and (ii) segment basis. Liquidity and Capital Resources.
This section provides a discussion of our financial condition and liquidity, an analysis of our cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as well as certain contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements. Seasonality of Our Business.
This section discusses the seasonal performance of our Entertainment and MSG Networks segments. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Policies.
This section discusses accounting pronouncements that have been adopted by the Company, recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted by the Company, as well as the results of the Company’s annual impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets performed during the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023. This section should be read together with our critical accounting policies, which are discussed in our Form 10-K under “Item. 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Policies —
39 Critical Accounting Policies” and in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements (“financial statements”) of the Company included therein. Factors Affecting Results of Operations Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business The Company’s operations and operating results were not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period, which was impacted by (i) fewer ticketed events at our performance venues due to the lead-time required to book touring acts and artists, (ii) the postponement or cancellation of select events at our performance venues (including the partial cancellation of the 2021 production of the
Christmas Spectacular) , and a temporary impact to both demand and operations at Tao Group Hospitality as a result of an increase in COVID-19 cases during the fiscal second quarter, and (iii) certain regulatory requirements, including vaccination/mask requirements for our performance, entertainment dining and nightlife venues, which contributed to certain Tao Group Hospitality branded locations remaining closed during the period. See Note 1, Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in the 2022 Form 10-K for more information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. It is unclear to what extent COVID-19 concerns, including with respect to new variants, could result in new government or league-mandated capacity or other restrictions or vaccination/mask requirements or impact the use of and/or demand for our performance, entertainment dining and nightlife venues, demand for our sponsorship and advertising assets, deter our employees and vendors from working at our venues (which may lead to difficulties in staffing) or otherwise materially impact our operations. In addition to the above, the operating results of our segments are largely dependent on our ability to attract concerts and other events to our venues, as well as customers to our entertainment and nightlife offerings, revenues under various agreements entered into with MSG Sports, the continuing popularity of the
Christmas Spectacular , the affiliation agreements MSG Networks negotiates with Distributors, the number of Distributor subscribers that receive our networks, and the advertising rates we charge advertisers. Certain of these factors in turn depend on the popularity and/or performance of the professional sports teams whose games we broadcast on our networks and host in our venues. Our Company’s future performance is dependent in part on general economic conditions and the effect of these conditions on our customers. Weak economic conditions may lead to lower demand for our entertainment and nightlife offerings and programming content, suite licenses and tickets to our live productions, concerts, family shows and other events, which would also negatively affect concession and merchandise sales, lower levels of sponsorship and venue signage and decrease advertising revenues. These conditions may also affect the number of concerts, family shows and other events that take place in the future. An economic downturn could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Due largely to our media rights agreements with the NBA and NHL teams appearing on our networks and the generally recurring nature of our affiliation fee revenue, the MSG Networks segment has consistently produced operating profits for a number of years. Advertising revenues are less predictable and can vary based upon a number of factors, including general economic conditions and team performance. The Company continues to explore additional opportunities to expand our presence in the entertainment industry. Any new investment may not initially contribute to operating income, but is intended to become operationally profitable over time. Our results will also be affected by investments in, and the success of, new productions. 40 Consolidated Results of Operations Comparison of the Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 versus the Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 The tables below set forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information.   Three Months Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percentage Revenues $ 642,198  $ 516,439  $ 125,759  24  % Direct operating expenses (348,959) (296,258) (52,701) 18  % Selling, general and administrative expenses

Factors Affecting Results of Operations The Company’s operations and operating results were not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year period, which was impacted by (i) fewer ticketed events at our performance venues due to the lead-time required to book touring acts and artists, (ii) the postponement or cancellation of select events at our performance venues (including the partial cancellation of the 2021 production of the
Christmas Spectacular) , and a temporary impact to both demand and operations at Tao Group Hospitality as a result of an increase in COVID-19 cases during the fiscal second quarter, and (iii) certain regulatory requirements, including vaccination/mask requirements for our performance, entertainment dining and nightlife venues, which contributed to certain Tao Group Hospitality branded locations remaining closed during the period.

Other expense, net
Other expense, net
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, decreased $15,021 and $20,300, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to lower unrealized losses of approximately $15,500 and $21,300, respectively, associated with the Company’s investments in DraftKings Inc.

The changes in revenues were attributable to the following: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2022 Increase in revenues from the presentation of the

Christmas Spectacular
performances during this year’s holiday season, of which 174 took place in the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, as compared to 101 performances in the prior year’s holiday season (due to the partial cancellation of the 2021 production as a result of an increase in COVID-19 cases), all of which took place in the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2022. For this year’s holiday season, more than 930,000 tickets were sold, representing an over 25% increase in attendance on a per-show basis as compared to the prior year. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the increase in revenues from the presentation of the
Christmas Spectacular
production, as compared to the prior year periods, was primarily due to higher ticket-related revenues. This reflected an increase in the number of performances as compared to the prior year periods and, to a lesser extent, higher per-show paid attendance. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the increase in revenues subject to the sharing of economics with MSG Sports pursuant to the Arena License Agreements primarily reflected higher suite license fee revenues and higher food, beverage and merchandise sales at Knicks and Rangers games. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the increase in revenues primarily reflects higher suite license fee revenues, which was mainly due to the return of live events at the Company’s venues as compared to limited live events held during the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2022 (due to the COVID-19 pandemic). For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the increase in event-related revenues primarily reflects higher revenues from concerts of $7,866 and $88,072, respectively. The increase for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was due to an increase in the number of concerts at the Company’s venues as compared to the prior year period, partially offset by lower per-concert revenues primarily due to the mix of events. The increase in revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the return of live events at the Company’s venues as compared to limited live events held during the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2022 (due to the COVID-19 pandemic).

The improvements in operating income (loss) were primarily due to an increase in revenues, partially offset by higher direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, as discussed above. Adjusted operating income (loss) Adjusted operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $66,313 as compared to adjusted operating income of $14,982 in the prior year period, an increase of $51,331.

For the six months ended December 31, 2022, adjusted operating income was $21,873 as compared to a loss of $56,410 in the prior year period, an improvement of $78,283. The improvement in adjusted operating income was primarily due to an increase in revenues, partially offset by an increase in direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. 49 MSG Networks The tables below set forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income for the Company’s MSG Networks segment.

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business ” for more information. 50 Revenues For the three months ended December 31, 2022, MSG Networks generated total revenues of $158,898, a decrease of $1,083, or 1%, as compared to the prior year quarter. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, MSG Networks generated total revenues of $281,377, a decrease of $20,077, or 7%, as compared to the prior year period. The changes in revenues were attributable to the following: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2022 Decrease in affiliation fee revenue $ (7,549) $ (26,510) Increase in advertising revenue 6,315  6,226  Other net increases 151  207  $ (1,083) $ (20,077) For the three months ended December 31, 2022, affiliation fee revenue decreased $7,549, primarily due to a decrease in subscribers of approximately 10.5%. These decreases were partially offset by net favorable affiliate adjustments of approximately $4,100 and the impact of higher affiliation rates. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, affiliation fee revenue decreased $26,510, primarily due to the impact of the non-renewal of MSG Networks’ carriage agreement with Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”) as of October 1, 2021 and a decrease in subscribers of approximately 10.0% (excluding the impact of the non-renewal with Comcast). These decreases were partially offset by net favorable affiliate adjustments of approximately $10,400 and the impact of higher affiliation rates. Effective October 1, 2021, Comcast’s license to carry MSG Networks expired and MSG Networks has not been carried by Comcast since that date. Comcast’s non-carriage has reduced MSG Networks’ subscribers by approximately 10.0% and has reduced MSG Networks’ revenue by a comparable percentage. In addition, MSG Networks’ segment operating income and AOI have been reduced by an amount that is approximately equal to the dollar amount of the reduced revenue. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the increase in advertising revenue primarily reflected the impact of a higher number of live professional sports telecasts and an increase in per-game advertising sales as compared with the prior year periods and higher sales related to the Company’s non-ratings-based advertising initiatives. Direct operating expenses Direct operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $4,476 to $90,400 as compared to the prior year period. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, direct operating expenses increased $11,473 to $165,820 as compared to the prior year period. The increases were attributable to the following:   Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2022 Increase due to higher rights fees expense primarily due to the impact of annual contractual rate increases in the current year period and the absence of reductions in media rights fees related to the shortened 2020-21 NHL season recorded in the prior year first quarter $ 3,072  $ 9,005  Increase in other programming and production costs including the impact of a higher number of live professional sports telecasts in the current year period 1,404  2,468  $ 4,476  $ 11,473  Selling, general and administrative expenses For the three months ended December 31, 2022, selling, general and administrative expenses of $38,083 increased $891 as compared to the prior year quarter. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, selling, general and administrative expenses of $55,899 decreased $29,268 as compared to the prior year quarter. 51 Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2022 Impact of the acquisition of MSG Networks by MSG Entertainment in July 2021, including litigation costs in the current year period $ 4,669  $ (18,328) Increase in advertising commissions and other expenses 1,717  1,228  Decrease due to lower employee compensation and related benefits (2,834) (6,057) Decrease due to lower advertising and marketing expenses (2,661) (6,111) $ 891  $ (29,268) Operating income For the three months ended December 31, 2022, operating income of $24,790 decreased $10,319, or 29%, as compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the increase in direct operating expenses, the impact of restructuring charges and, to a lesser extent, the decrease in revenues, and the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses (including the impact of higher acquisition-related costs). For the six months ended December 31, 2022, operating income of $52,415 decreased $5,972, or 10%, as compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the decrease in revenues, increase in direct operating expenses, and the impact of restructuring charges, partially offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses (including the impact of lower acquisition-related costs). Adjusted operating income For the three months ended December 31, 2022, adjusted operating income of $39,301 decreased $4,541, or 10%, as compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the increase in direct operating expenses and, to a lesser extent, the decrease in revenues, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding the impact of higher acquisition-related costs). For the six months ended December 31, 2022, adjusted operating income of $72,193 decreased $27,442, or 28%, as compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the decrease in revenues and increase in direct operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding the impact of lower acquisition-related costs). 52 Tao Group Hospitality The tables below set forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income for the Company’s Tao Group Hospitality segment.

Factors Affecting Results of Operations For the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, Tao Group Hospitality’s operations and operating results were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This included certain regulatory requirements such as vaccination/mask requirements, which contributed to certain branded locations remaining closed during the period, and a temporary impact to both demand and operations as a result of an increase in COVID-19 cases during the fiscal 2022 second quarter. As of December 31, 2022 and as of the date of this filing, Tao Group Hospitality’s domestic venues no longer require guests to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination before entering, and Tao Group Hospitality is operating without capacity restrictions in all markets.

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business ” for more information. 53 Revenues Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $18,908, or 16%, to $135,994 as compared to the prior year period. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, revenues increased $32,095, or 14% to $268,645. The changes in revenue were attributable to the following: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2022 Increase in revenues for comparable venues that opened more than 15 months ago $ 9,259  $ 10,736  Increase in revenues associated with new venue openings 6,377  13,914  Increase in revenues associated with venues that were temporarily closed in the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic 2,685  5,798  Other net increases 587  1,647  $ 18,908  $ 32,095  For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the increase in revenues associated with new venue openings was primarily due to the opening of Lavo Ristorante in Los Angeles, a venue that first opened in March 2022, Lavo San Diego, which first opened in June 2022 following the rebranding of a legacy Hakkasan venue, Fleur Room in Los Angeles, a venue that first opened in August 2022, and Tao Beach in Las Vegas which reopened in April 2022 following a multi-year renovation.
For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the increase in revenues associated with venues that were temporarily closed in the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic was due to Avenue and Marquee Singapore reopening in April and July 2022, respectively, and Herringbone Waikiki reopening in November 2021. Direct operating expenses Direct operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $15,603, or 26%, to $76,483 as compared to the prior year period. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, direct operating expenses increased $31,087, or 25%, to $153,060. The net increases were attributable to the following:   Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2022 Increase in employee compensation and related benefits at existing venues and reflecting the impact of new venues $ 7,171  $ 15,105  Increase in the costs of food and beverage due to the impact of inflation, higher comparable venue revenues, and new venue openings 3,342  7,432  Increase in venue entertainment costs 2,636  3,782  Increase in rent expense 1,816  3,850  Other net increases 638  918  $ 15,603  $ 31,087  Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $2,481, or 6%, to $43,166 as compared to the prior year period. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $11,933, or 16% to $86,712. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the net increases were primarily due to (i) higher employee compensation and related benefits of $3,076 and $9,705, respectively, reflecting the impact of increased staffing as the business returns to normal operations and (ii) a net increase of $402 and $2,298, respectively, in restaurant expenses, as well as supplies, utilities, general liability insurance, pre-opening expenses, and repairs and maintenance, and marketing expenses, partially offset by other net decreases. Impairment and other gains (losses) For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a net gain of $473 related to the sale of certain leasehold improvements in connection with closing of a venue. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded net gains of $7,443 principally from the write-off and modification of lease liabilities associated with certain venues.
54 Operating income
Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $11,202 as compared to $16,721 in the prior year period, a decrease of $5,519, or 33%. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in direct operating expenses, a decrease in other net gains, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased revenues. Operating income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $17,100 as compared to $26,802 in the prior year period, a decrease of $9,702, or 36%. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in direct operating expenses and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased revenues. Adjusted operating income Adjusted operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $18,719 as compared to $17,479 in the prior year period, an increase of $1,240, or 7%. The increase in adjusted operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was due to an increase in revenues, partially offset by higher direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses.
Adjusted operating income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $33,299 as compared to $43,667 in the prior year period, a decrease of $10,368, or 24%. The decrease in adjusted operating income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was due to higher direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in revenues. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from the operations of our businesses
and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities.
Our principal uses of cash include working capital-related items (including funding our operations), capital spending (including our construction of MSG Sphere at The Venetian in Las Vegas and related original content, as described below), debt service, investments and related loans and advances that we may fund from time to time, and mandatory purchases from prior acquisitions. We may also use cash to repurchase our common stock. Our decisions as to the use of our available liquidity will be based upon the ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, the optimal allocation of cash resources, and the timing of cash flow generation. To the extent that we desire to access alternative sources of funding through the capital and credit markets, challenging U.S. and global economic and market conditions could adversely impact our ability to do so at that time.
We regularly monitor and assess our ability to meet our net funding and investing requirements, including the construction of MSG Sphere at The Venetian. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance, inclusive of approximately $218,000 in advance cash proceeds primarily related to tickets, suites and sponsorships, was $432,173 as compared to $441,350 as of September 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2022 the Company’s restricted cash and cash equivalents balance was $121,563, inclusive of $75,000 that is required to be held in an account pledged as collateral for the MSG Sphere Term Loan Facility until its release upon the Liquidity Covenant Reduction Date (as defined under Note 10). The principal balance of the Company’s total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022 was $2,010,725, compared to $1,756,898 as of September 30, 2022. We believe we have sufficient liquidity from cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and cash flows from operations (including savings generated by the Company’s cost reduction program and expected cash from operations from MSG Sphere at the Venetian ) to fund our operations and service the credit facilities for the foreseeable future, as well as complete the construction of MSG Sphere at The Venetian. This also includes the Company’s expectation that it will pay down a portion of MSG Networks’ term loan upon the refinancing of the loan prior to its maturity in October 2024.
The Company is exploring a sale of its interest in Tao Group Hospitality in order to further advance the broader MSG Sphere initiative, including additional personnel, as well as the continued development of content and related technology. Should the Company choose not to sell its interest in Tao Group Hospitality, it may pursue additional cost cutting and would need to access additional capital, which may include the monetization of the Company’s retained interest in the live entertainment business upon completion of the planned spin-off. There is no assurance that the Company would be able to obtain such capital. Any additional cost reduction program would include further reductions in discretionary spend in normal course of business and reductions in investments in capital not essential for MSG Sphere. See Note 10, Credit Facilities to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the MSG Networks Credit Facilities, the National Properties Credit Facilities, the MSG Sphere Term Loan Facility and the Tao Credit Facilities. 55 For additional information regarding the Company’s capital expenditures, including those related to MSG Sphere, see Note 22, Segment Information to the Company’s audited consolidated and combined financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended June 30, 2022 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. On March 31, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized, effective following the Entertainment Distribution, a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $350,000 of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. Under the authorization, shares of Class A Common Stock may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. The timing and amount of purchases will depend on market conditions and other factors. No shares have been repurchased under the share repurchase program to date. MSG Spheres The Company has made significant progress on MSG Sphere at The Venetian, its state-of-the-art entertainment venue under construction in Las Vegas. See “Part I — Item 1. Our Business — Our Performance Venues — MSG Sphere” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company expects the venue to have a number of significant revenue streams, including a wide variety of content such as attractions, concert residencies and corporate and select sporting events, as well as sponsorship and premium hospitality opportunities. As a result, we anticipate that MSG Sphere at The Venetian will generate substantial revenue and adjusted operating income on an annual basis. MSG Sphere at The Venetian is a complex construction project that has become even more challenging due to the global impact of COVID-19. In April 2020, the Company announced that it was suspending construction due to COVID-19-related factors outside of its control, including supply chain issues. As the ongoing effects of the pandemic continued to impact its business operations, in August 2020, the Company disclosed that it resumed construction with a lengthened timetable. The Company remains committed to bringing MSG Sphere to Las Vegas and expects to open the venue in September 2023. As with any major construction project, the construction of MSG Sphere is subject to potential delays, unexpected complications or cost fluctuations. As of December 31, 2022,
our cost estimate, inclusive of core technology and soft costs, for MSG Sphere at The Venetian was approximately $2,175,000. This cost estimate was net of $75,000 that the Venetian has agreed to pay to defray certain construction costs and also excludes significant capitalized and non-capitalized costs for items such as content creation, internal labor, capitalized interest, and furniture and equipment. Relative to our cost estimate above, our actual construction costs for MSG Sphere at The Venetian incurred through December 31, 2022 were approximately $2,015,000, which is net of $65,000 received from the Venetian. The amount of construction costs incurred as of December 31, 2022 includes approximately $236,000 of accrued expenses that were not yet paid as of that date. With regard to MSG Sphere at The Venetian, the Company plans to finance the construction of the venue from cash-on-hand and cash flows from operations (including savings generated by the Company’s cost reduction program and expected cash from operations from MSG Sphere at the Venetian). The Company also continues to have revolver capacity available under its credit facilities, if needed. While the Company plans to self-fund the construction of MSG Sphere at The Venetian, under the right terms it would consider third-party financing alternatives. The Company’s intention for any future venues is to utilize several options, such as non-recourse debt financing, joint ventures, equity partners and a managed venue model. In February 2018, we announced the purchase of land in Stratford, London, which we expect will become home to a future MSG Sphere. The Company submitted planning applications to the local planning authority in March 2019 and that process, which requires various stages of review to be completed and approvals to be granted, is ongoing. Therefore, we do not have a definitive timeline at this time. We will continue to explore additional domestic and international markets where we believe next-generation venues such as MSG Sphere can be successful.

The National Properties Credit Agreement includes financial covenants requiring MSG National Properties and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a specified minimum liquidity level, a specified minimum debt service coverage ratio and specified maximum total leverage ratio. The minimum liquidity level is set at $50,000, and is tested based on the level of average daily liquidity, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and available revolving commitments, over the last month of each quarter over the life of the National Properties Credit Facilities. The debt service coverage ratio covenant began testing in the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022, and is set at a ratio of 2:1 before stepping up to 2.5:1 in the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024. The leverage ratio covenant begins testing in the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2023. It is tested based on the ratio of MSG National Properties and its restricted subsidiaries’ consolidated total indebtedness to adjusted operating income, with an initial maximum ratio of 6:1, stepping down to 5.5:1 in the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024 and 4.5:1 in the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2026. As of December 31, 2022, MSG National Properties and its restricted subsidiaries were in compliance with the covenants of the National Properties Credit Agreement. MSG Sphere Term Loan Facility On December 22, 2022, MSG Las Vegas, LLC (“MSG LV”), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto, providing for a five-year, $275,000 senior secured term loan facility (the “MSG Sphere Term Loan Facility”). All obligations under the MSG Sphere Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by MSG Entertainment Group. 57 The MSG Sphere Term Loan Facility will mature on December 22, 2027. The principal obligations under the MSG Sphere Term Loan Facility are due at the maturity of the facility, with no amortization payments prior to maturity.
Under certain circumstances, MSG LV is required to make mandatory prepayments on the loan, including prepayments in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of casualty insurance and/or condemnation recoveries (subject to certain reinvestment, repair or replacement rights), subject to certain exceptions. The MSG Sphere Term Loan Facility includes financial covenants requiring MSG LV to maintain a specified minimum debt service coverage ratio and requiring MSG Entertainment Group to maintain a specified minimum liquidity level. The debt service coverage ratio covenant begins testing in the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023 on a historical basis and, beginning with the first fiscal quarter occurring after the date on which the first ticketed performance or event open to the general public occurs at the MSG Sphere in Las Vegas (the “Opening Date”), is also tested on a prospective basis. Both the historical and prospective debt service coverage ratios are set at 1.35:1. In addition, among other conditions, MSG LV is not permitted to make distributions to MSG Entertainment Group unless the historical and prospective debt service coverage ratios are at least 1.50:1. The minimum liquidity level for MSG Entertainment Group is set at $100,000, with $75,000 required to be held in cash or cash equivalents, which amounts, prior to the Liquidity Covenant Reduction Date (as defined below), must be held in an account pledged as collateral for the MSG Sphere Term Loan Facility until its release upon the Liquidity Covenant Reduction Date (the “Pledged Account”), before stepping down to $50,000, with $25,000 required to be held in cash or cash equivalents, once the MSG Sphere in Las Vegas has been substantially completed and certain of its systems are ready to be used in live, immersive events (the “Liquidity Covenant Reduction Date”). The minimum liquidity level was tested on the closing date and is tested as of the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter based on MSG Entertainment Group’s unencumbered liquidity, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and available lines of credit, as of such date. In the event the Company completes the spin-off of its traditional live entertainment business currently under consideration (the “MSGE Spin-off”) and retains an economic interest in the live entertainment company (the “Live Entertainment Company Retained Interest”), the Live Entertainment Company Retained Interest will be pledged to secure the MSG Sphere Term Loan Facility until the pledge is released upon the Liquidity Covenant Reduction Date, and a portion of the value of the Live Entertainment Company Retained Interest may also be counted toward the minimum liquidity level. Tao Credit Facilities
On June 9, 2022, TAO Group Intermediate Holdings LLC (“TAOIH” or “Intermediate Holdings”) and TAO Group Operating LLC (“TAOG” or “Senior Borrower”) entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Restated Tao Senior Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, and the lenders party thereto. The Restated Tao Senior Credit Agreement provides TAOG with senior secured credit facilities (the “Tao Credit Facilities”) consisting of: (i) an initial $75,000 term loan facility with a term of five years (the “Tao Term Loan Facility”) and (ii) a $60,000 revolving credit facility with a term of five years (the “Tao Revolving Credit Facility”). Up to $5,000 of the Tao Revolving Credit Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2022, outstanding letters of credit were $750 and the remaining borrowing available under the Tao Revolving Credit Facility was $49,250.
The Tao Term Loan Facility amortizes quarterly in accordance with its terms from June 9, 2022 through the maturity date on June 9, 2027. TAOG is required to make mandatory prepayments of the Tao Term Loan Facility from the net cash proceeds of certain sales of assets (including Tao Collateral) or casualty insurance and/or condemnation recoveries (in each case, subject to certain reinvestment, repair or replacement rights) and the incurrence of certain indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions.
The Restated Tao Senior Credit Agreement requires TAOIH to comply with a maximum total leverage ratio of 3.50:1.00, a maximum senior leverage ratio of 2.50:1.00 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25:1.00. The Restated Tao Senior Credit Agreement, among other things, (i) increased the minimum liquidity for TAOG to $20,000 and maximum capital expenditures to $30,000, with a one year carry forward of $20,000 , (ii) increased the basket for the maximum amount of the incremental revolving credit facility to $50,000; and (iii) amended certain other financial covenants regarding leverage to allow up to $10,000 of cash netting. As of December 31, 2022, TAOG, TAOIH and the restricted subsidiaries were in compliance with the covenants of the Restated Tao Senior Credit Agreement. Letters of Credit
The Company uses letters of credit to support its business operations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a total of $9,478 of letters of credit outstanding, which included two letters of credit for an aggregate of $750 issued under the Tao Revolving Credit Facility and two outstanding letters of credit for an aggregate of $7,860 issued under the National Properties Revolving Credit Facility. 58 Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any material changes in its non-cancelable contractual obligations (other than activities in the ordinary course of business), except for the execution of the MSG Sphere Term Loan Facility on December 22, 2022. See Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies,
to the financial statements included in “— Item 1. Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details on the timing and amount of payments under various media rights agreements. Cash Flow Discussion As of December 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $553,736, as compared to $846,010 as of June 30, 2022. The following table summarizes the Company’s cash flow activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 54,965  $ 132,786  Net cash used in investing activities (575,909) (332,532) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 229,175  (57,639) Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (505) (572) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (292,274) $ (257,957) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $77,821 to $54,965 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to changes in working capital assets and liabilities, which included (i) a decrease in deferred revenue associated with customers’ advanced payments, (ii) higher cash payments to promoters, (iii) lower accrued and other liabilities, including related party payables, and (iv) higher prepaid expenses, partially offset by operating income in the current year period. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $243,377 to $575,909 as compared to the prior year period primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures mainly for the MSG Sphere in the current year period. Financing Activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $286,814 to $229,175 as compared to the prior year period primarily due to the proceeds received from the MSG Sphere Term Loan Facility in current year period. Seasonality of Our Business The revenues the Company earns from the  Christmas Spectacular
and arena license fees from MSG Sports in connection with the Knicks’ and Rangers’ use of The Garden generally means that the Entertainment segment earns a disproportionate share of its revenues and operating income in the second and third quarters of the Company’s fiscal year with the first fiscal quarter being disproportionally lower. Similarly, MSG Networks’ advertising revenue is largely derived from the sale of inventory in its live professional sports programming, and as such, a disproportionate share of this revenue has historically been earned in the second and third fiscal quarters. As a result of the foregoing, the Company’s revenue and operating income are disproportionally higher in the fiscal second and third quarter of the fiscal year and lower in the first quarter of the fiscal year. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Estimates Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Accounting Policies, to the financial statements included in “— Item 1. Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. 59 Critical Accounting Estimates There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies, except for the addition of a policy related to production costs from the Company’s Original Immersive Productions mentioned in Note 2. Accounting Policies in “— Item 1. Financial Statements”, as compared with those set forth in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Company’s audited consolidated and combined financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended June 30, 2022 included in the Form 10-K. The following discussion has been included to provide the results of our annual impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets performed during the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023.
Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as of August 31 st
and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The Company performs its goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had three operating and reportable segments consistent with the process the Company’s management followed in making decisions and allocating resources to the business.
For purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company has three reporting units: Entertainment, MSG Networks and Tao Group Hospitality. The goodwill balance reported on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 by reporting unit was as follows:   Entertainment $ 74,309  MSG Networks 424,508  Tao Group Hospitality 1,364  $ 500,181  The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If the Company can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would not need to perform a quantitative impairment test for that reporting unit. If the Company cannot support such a conclusion or the Company does not elect to perform the qualitative assessment, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The estimates of the fair value of the Company’s reporting units are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, comparable market transactions or other acceptable valuation techniques, including the cost approach. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rates, cost-based assumptions, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. Significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the selection of the appropriate discount rate, the estimate of the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and identification of appropriate continuing growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in the analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows. The amount of an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
The Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment of impairment for all of the Company’s reporting units for the Fiscal Year 2023 annual impairment test. These assessments considered factors such as:
• macroeconomic conditions; • industry and market considerations; • cost factors; • overall financial performance of the reporting units; • other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; and • relevant reporting unit specific events such as changes in the carrying amount of net assets. During the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, the Company performed its most recent annual impairment tests of goodwill and determined that there were no impairments of goodwill identified for any of its reporting units as of the impairment test date. Based on these impairment tests, the Company’s reporting units had sufficient safety margins, representing the excess of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, derived from the most recent quantitative assessments, less its respective carrying value (including goodwill allocated to each respective reporting unit). The Company believes that if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%, a sufficient safety margin has been realized. 60 Identifiable Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment as of August 31 st
and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The following table sets forth the amount of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets reported in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022:   Trademarks
$ 61,881  Photographic related rights 1,920  $ 63,801  The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In the qualitative assessment, the Company must evaluate the totality of qualitative factors, including any recent fair value measurements, that impact whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset other than goodwill has a carrying amount that more likely than not exceeds its fair value. The Company must proceed to conducting a quantitative analysis, if the Company (i) determines that such an impairment is more likely than not to exist, or (ii) forgoes the qualitative assessment entirely. Under the quantitative assessment, the impairment test for identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For all periods presented, the Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment of impairment for the photographic related rights and the trademarks. These assessments considered the events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair values of the intangible assets. Examples of such events and circumstances include: • cost factors; • financial performance; • legal, regulatory, contractual, business or other factors; • other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; • industry and market considerations; and • macroeconomic conditions. During the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, the Company performed its most recent annual impairment test of the identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets and determined that there were no impairments identified. Based on these impairment tests, the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets had sufficient safety margins, representing the excess of each identifiable indefinite-lived intangible asset’s estimated fair value over its respective carrying value. The Company believes that if the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%, a sufficient safety margin has been realized.
Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There were no material changes to the disclosures regarding market risks in connection with our pension and postretirement plans. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” of our Form 10-K. Potential Interest Rate Risk Exposure The Company, through its subsidiaries, MSG National Properties, MSG Networks and MSG LV, and the consolidation of Tao Group Hospitality, is subject to potential interest rate risk exposure related to borrowings incurred under their respective credit facilities. Changes in interest rates may increase interest expense payments with respect to any borrowings incurred under these credit facilities. The effect of a hypothetical 200 basis point increase in floating interest rate prevailing as of December 31, 2022 and continuing for a full year would increase the Company’s interest expense on the outstanding amounts under the credit facilities by $40,215. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Exposure We are exposed to market risk resulting from foreign currency fluctuations, primarily to the British pound sterling through our net investment position initiated with our acquisition of land in London in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 for future MSG Sphere development and through cash and invested funds which will be deployed in the construction of our London venue. We may evaluate and decide, to the extent reasonable and practical, to reduce the translation risk of foreign currency fluctuations by entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions. If we were to enter into such hedging transactions, the market risk resulting from foreign currency fluctuations is unlikely to be entirely eliminated. We do not plan to enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for foreign currency speculative purposes. During the past twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the GBP/USD exchange rate ranged from 1.0695 to 1.3967 as compared to GBP/ 61 USD exchange rate of 1.2120 on December 31, 2022, a fluctuation range of approximately 15.24%. As of December 31, 2022, a uniform hypothetical 14.28% fluctuation in the GBP/USD exchange rate would have resulted in a change of approximately $23,200 in the Company’s net asset value. Item 4.
Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 62 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
Legal Proceedings Fifteen complaints were filed in connection with the Company’s acquisition of MSG Networks Inc. (the “Merger”) by purported stockholders of the Company and MSG Networks Inc. Nine of these complaints involved allegations of materially incomplete and misleading information set forth in the joint proxy statement/prospectus filed by the Company and MSG Networks Inc. in connection with the Merger. As a result of supplemental disclosures made by the Company and MSG Networks Inc. on July 1, 2021, all of the disclosure actions were voluntarily dismissed with prejudice prior to or shortly following the consummation of the Merger. Six complaints involved allegations of fiduciary breaches in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger and have since been consolidated into two remaining litigations. On September 10, 2021, the Court of Chancery entered an order consolidating two derivative complaints filed by purported Company stockholders. The consolidated action is captioned:
In re Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. Stockholders Litigation , C.A. No. 2021-0468-KSJM. The consolidated plaintiffs filed their Verified Consolidated Derivative Complaint on October 11, 2021. The complaint, which names the Company as only a nominal defendant, retains all of the derivative claims and alleges that the members of the board of directors and controlling stockholders violated their fiduciary duties in the course of negotiating and approving the Merger. Plaintiffs seek, among other relief, an award of damages to the Company including interest, and plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. The Company and other defendants filed answers to the complaint on December 30, 2021. The Company substantially completed its production of documents responsive to plaintiffs’ requests on June 24, 2022, and on November 16, 2022, fact discovery closed. The Company continues to be engaged in responding to plaintiffs’ outstanding discovery requests. Pursuant to the indemnity rights in its bylaws and Delaware law, the Company is advancing the costs incurred by defendants in this action, and defendants may assert indemnification rights in respect of any adverse judgment or settlement of the action. On September 27, 2021, the Court of Chancery entered an order consolidating four complaints filed by purported stockholders of MSG Networks Inc. The consolidated action is captioned:
In re MSG Networks Inc. Stockholder Class Action Litigation , C.A. No. 2021-0575-KSJM (the “MSG Networks Action”). The consolidated plaintiffs filed their Verified Consolidated Stockholder Class Action Complaint on October 29, 2021. The complaint asserts claims on behalf of a putative class of former MSG Networks Inc. stockholders against each member of the board of directors of MSG Networks Inc. and the controlling stockholders prior to the Merger. Plaintiffs allege that the MSG Networks Inc. board of directors and controlling stockholders breached their fiduciary duties in negotiating and approving the Merger. The Company is not named as a defendant but has been subpoenaed to produce documents and testimony related to the Merger. Plaintiffs seek, among other relief, monetary damages for the putative class and plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. Defendants in the MSG Networks Action filed answers to the complaint on December 30, 2021. The Company substantially completed its production of documents responsive to plaintiffs’ requests on June 24, 2022, and on November 16, 2022 fact discovery closed. The Company continues to be engaged in responding to plaintiffs’ outstanding discovery requests.
Pursuant to the indemnity rights in its bylaws and Delaware law, the Company is advancing the costs incurred by defendants in this action, and defendants may assert indemnification rights in respect of any adverse judgment or settlement of the action. On September 19, 2022, the Court of Chancery approved a case schedule, governing the two consolidated actions, which set trial dates for April 2023. On January 3, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted the unopposed motion for class certification in the MSG Networks Action. A joint-mediation session is scheduled for February 11 and 12, 2023. On January 12, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted a stipulation and order dismissing former MSG Networks Inc. directors William Bell, Stephen Mills and Hank Ratner from the MSG Networks Action. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any, with respect to these Merger-related claims. Accordingly, no accrual for these matters has been made in our financial statements. The Company is a defendant in various other lawsuits. Although the outcome of these other lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty (including the extent of available insurance, if any), management does not believe that resolution of these other lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Company. 63 Item 2.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds As of December 31, 2022, the Company has the ability to repurchase up to $350 million of the Company’s Class A Common Stock under the Class A Common Stock share repurchase program authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors on March 31, 2020. Under the authorization, shares of Class A Common Stock may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. The timing and amount of purchases will depend on market conditions and other factors. No shares have been repurchased to date. 64 Item 6.
