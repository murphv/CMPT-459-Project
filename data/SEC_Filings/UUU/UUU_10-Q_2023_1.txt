Table of Contents UNIVERSAL SECURITY INSTRUMENTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Statement of Management The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Universal Security Instruments, Inc. (USI or the Company) and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Except for the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022, which was derived from audited financial statements, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. Significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US-GAAP) have been condensed or omitted. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s March 31, 2022, audited financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K as filed on July 14, 2022. The interim operating results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year. As previously reported, on February 25, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company (USI), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company D-U Merger Sub, Inc. a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”) and Infinite Reality, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Infinite Reality”). On May 16, 2022, the Company filed with the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) a proxy statement and Form S-4 registration statement in connection with the Merger. On December 12, 2022, Infinite Reality terminated the Merger Agreement. ​ Liquidity and
Management Plans In light of the shutdowns, quarantines and other restrictions and delays in operations and travel caused by or related to COVID-19 in Hong Kong, the PRC and the United States, the Company has experienced delays during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, in shipping and receiving of products. Our short-term borrowings to finance any operating losses, trade accounts receivable, and foreign inventory purchases are provided pursuant to the terms of its Factoring Agreement with Merchant Factors Corporation (Merchant or Factor). Borrowings under the Factoring Agreement bear interest at prime plus
2 % and are secured by trade accounts receivable and inventory. Advances from Merchant are at the sole discretion of Merchant based on Merchant’s assessment of the Company’s receivables, inventory, and financial condition at the time of each request for an advance. The Company had
no
availability on this facility on December 31, 2022. The Company’s non-factored trade and other accounts receivable net of allowance for uncollectible amounts totaled $ 817,589
on December 31, 2022. The Company’s factor has withheld financing on approximately $ 725,000
of the Company’s accounts receivable at December 31, 2022, subject to resolution of any disputes. The resolution of disputed items is ongoing and subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company continues to provide support for resolution of any disputed items. The Company expects that all amounts in dispute will be resolved satisfactorily. In addition, the Company has filed requests for refunds of customs payments with US Customs and Border Protection for approximately $ 300,000
(including interest expected) for overpayments of tariff. The Company expects this refund to be available during either the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, or the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. Though no assurances can be given, if management’s plan continues to be successful over the next twelve months, the Company anticipates that it should be able to meet its cash needs for the next twelve months following the issuance date of this report. Cash flows and credit availability is expected to be adequate to fund operations for one year from the issuance date of this report. ​ Line of Credit – Factor In 2015, the Company entered into a Factoring Agreement (the Agreement) with Merchant for the purpose of factoring the Company’s trade accounts receivable and to provide financing secured by finished goods inventory. Under the Agreement the Company may borrow eighty percent ( 80 %) of eligible accounts receivable. Additional funding, characterized by Merchant as an over advance, may be provided up to one hundred percent ( 100 %) of eligible accounts receivable. The over advance portion, if any, may not exceed fifty percent ( 50 %) of eligible inventory up to a maximum of $ 500,000 . 9
Table of Contents The Agreement has been extended and now expires on January 6, 2024. and provides for continuation of the program for successive
two-year
periods until terminated by one of the parties to the Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had borrowings under the Agreement of approximately $ 2,471,000 . Advances on factored trade accounts receivable are secured by the Company’s trade accounts receivable and inventories, are repaid periodically as collections are made by Merchant but are otherwise due upon demand, and bear interest at the prime commercial rate of interest, as published, plus
two  percent (Effective rate
9.50 % on December 31, 2022). There was no additional availability to borrow under the terms of the agreement at December 31, 2022. Advances under the factoring agreement are made at the sole discretion of Merchant, based on their assessment of the receivables, inventory and our financial condition at the time of each request for an advance. ​ Use of Estimates The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US-GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. ​ Revenue Recognition The Company’s primary source of revenue is the sale of safety and security products based upon purchase orders or contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized at a point in time once the Company has determined that the customer has obtained control over the product. Control is typically deemed to have been transferred to the customer when the product is shipped or delivered to the customer. Customers may not return, exchange, or refuse acceptance of goods without our approval. Generally, the Company does not grant extended payment terms. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight, after control over a product has transferred to a customer, are accounted for as a fulfillment cost, and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for products sold. Revenue is recorded at the transaction price net of estimates of variable consideration. The Company uses the expected value method based on historical data in considering the impact of estimates of variable consideration, which may include trade discounts, allowances, product returns (including rights of return) or warranty replacements. Estimates of variable consideration are included in revenue to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We have established allowances to cover anticipated doubtful accounts based upon historical experience. Disaggregation of Revenue The Company presents below revenue associated with sales of products acquired from Eyston Company Ltd. (Eyston) separately from revenue associated with sales of ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCI’s) and ventilation fans. The Company believes this disaggregation best depicts how our various product lines perform and are affected by economic factors. Revenue recognized by these categories for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three months ended
​ Nine months ended

Table of Contents Concentrations The Company is primarily a distributor of safety products for use in home and business under both its trade names and private labels for other companies. The Company acquires all of the smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarm safety products that it sells from Eyston Company, Ltd. In addition, the Company had one customer in the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022, that represented
30.5 %
and
17.8 %
of the Company’s net sales, respectively. The Company had one customer in the three-month period ended December 31, 2021, that represented
24.1 %
of the Company’s net sales, and two customers in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2021 that represented
11.8 %
and
11.1 %
of the Company’s net sales, respectively. Related Party Transactions During the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022, inventory purchases and other company expenses of approximately $ 523,000
and $ 1,513,000
respectively, were charged to credit card accounts of Harvey B. Grossblatt, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and certain of his immediate family members. During the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2021, inventory purchases and other company expenses of approximately $ 509,000
and $ 1,332,000
respectively, were charged to credit card accounts of Harvey B. Grossblatt, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and certain of his immediate family members. The Company subsequently reimbursed these charges in full. Mr. Grossblatt receives mileage benefits from these charges. The maximum amount outstanding and due to Mr. Grossblatt at any point during the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 amounted to $ 217,066
and $ 210,773 , respectively. There were
no
amounts due to Mr. Grossblatt at December 31, 2022. Receivables Receivables are recorded when the Company has an unconditional right to consideration. We have established allowances to cover anticipated doubtful accounts based upon historical experience. Remaining Performance Obligations Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of firm orders for satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations on contracts with an original expected duration of one year or more. The Company’s contracts are predominantly short-term in nature with a contract term of one year or less. For those contracts, the Company has utilized the practical expedient in ASC Topic 606 exempting the Company from disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less. ​ Income Taxes We calculate our interim tax provision in accordance with the guidance for accounting for income taxes in interim periods. We estimate the annual effective tax rate and apply that tax rate to our ordinary quarterly pre-tax income. The tax expense or benefit related to discrete events during the interim period is recognized in the interim period in which those events occurred. The Company recognizes a liability or asset for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements. These temporary differences may result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of the assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. The deferred tax assets are reviewed periodically for recoverability and a valuation allowance is provided whenever it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. After a review of projected taxable income and the components of the deferred tax asset in accordance with applicable accounting guidance it was determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with the remaining components of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This determination was made based on the Company’s history of losses from operations and the uncertainty as to whether the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to use the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was established to fully offset the value of the deferred tax assets. Our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax assets depends primarily upon the timing of future taxable income and the expiration dates of the components of the deferred tax assets. If sufficient future taxable income is generated, we may be able to offset a portion of future tax expenses. The Company follows ASC 740-10 which provides guidance for tax positions related to the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and requires that we recognize in our condensed consolidated financial statements
11
Table of Contents the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination, based on the technical merits of the position. Interest and penalties, if any, related to income tax matters are recorded as income tax expenses. ​ Accounts Receivable and Amount Due From Factor The Company assigns the majority of its short-term receivables arising in the ordinary course of business to our factor. At the time a receivable is assigned to our factor the credit risk associated with the credit worthiness of the debtor is assumed by the factor. The Company continues to bear any credit risk associated with sales to customers that are denied credit by the factor, dispute delivery, and/or have warranty issues related to the products sold. Management assesses the credit risk of both its trade accounts receivable and its financing receivables based on the specific identification of accounts that have exceeded credit terms. An allowance for uncollectible receivables is provided based on that assessment. Changes in the allowance account are charged to operations in the period the change is determined. Amounts ultimately determined to be uncollectible are eliminated from the receivable accounts and from the allowance account in the period that the receivables’ status is determined to be uncollectible. Based on the nature of the factoring agreement and prior experience,
no
allowance related to Amounts Due from Factor has been provided. At December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, an allowance of approximately $ 157,000
has been provided for uncollectible trade accounts receivable. ​ Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of stock options and other potentially dilutive common stock equivalents. The dilutive effect of stock options and other potentially dilutive common stock equivalents is determined using the treasury stock method based on the Company’s average stock price. There were
no
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, or 2021. As a result, basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are identical for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021. ​ Contingencies From time to time, the Company is involved in various claims and routine litigation matters. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcomes of such matters are not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in future years. ​ Note Payable - Eyston Company Ltd. On March 31, 2020, the Company sold its
fifty
percent ownership interest in the Hong Kong Joint Venture and converted $ 1,081,440
of trade accounts payable due to the Hong Kong Joint Venture to an unsecured long-term interest only note payable with the principal balance due in April 2022. The terms of the note payable were amended subsequent to March 31, 2022, to provide for monthly payments of $ 100,000
beginning April 2022 and until the note payable is paid in full. The principal balance outstanding on the note payable on December 31, 2022, is $ 181,440 . Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the principal balance of $ 181,440
was paid in full. Interest is based on the Shanghai Commercial Bank Limited in Hong Kong US Dollar prime rate published on the first day of each calendar month plus
2 % ( 9.50 % effective rate on December 31, 2022) and is payable monthly. ​ Leases The Company is a lessee in lease agreements for office space. Certain of the Company’s leases contain provisions that provide for one or more options to terminate or extend the lease at the Company’s sole discretion. The Company’s leases are comprised of fixed lease payments, with its real estate leases including lease payments subject to a rate or index which may be variable. Certain real estate leases also include executory costs such as common area maintenance (non-lease component). As a practical expedient permitted under ASC 842, the Company has elected to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The Company utilizes certain practical expedients for short-term leases, including the election not to reassess its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs, as well as the election not to separate lease and non-lease components for
12
Table of Contents arrangements where the Company is a lessee. Lease payments, which may include lease components and non-lease components, are included in the measurement of the Company’s lease liabilities to the extent that such payments are either fixed amounts or variable lease amounts based on a rate or index (fixed in substance) as stipulated in the lease contract. Effective March 2022, we extended our operating lease for a
15,000
square foot office and warehouse located in Baltimore County, Maryland to expire in April 2025 subject to a right to terminate the lease if the Company enters into a binding agreement to sell the assets of the Company. No option to continue the lease beyond April 2025 has been provided in the lease extension. Monthly rental expense, with common area maintenance, currently approximates $ 14,500
and increases
3.0 % per year. None of the Company’s lease agreements contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As a result of the Company’s election of the package of
practical expedients
permitted within ASC 842, which among other things, allows for the carryforward of historical lease classification, all of the Company’s lease agreements in existence at the date of adoption that were classified as operating leases under ASC 840 have been classified as operating leases under ASC 842. Lease expense for payments related to the Company’s operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the related lease term, which includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.
Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments as specified in the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to the Company’s operating leases are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term and amounted to approximately $ 485,000
at the date of adoption and increased by approximately $ 468,000
effective with the lease amendment and extension dated March 2022. When the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available surrounding the Company’s borrowing rates at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The right-of use asset also includes any lease payments made at or before lease commencement less any lease incentives. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had right-of-use assets of $ 350,468
and
lease liabilities of $ 359,547
related to its operating leases. Right-of-use assets are included in property and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheet and lease liabilities related to the Company’s operating leases are included in short-term and long-term lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate related to its operating leases is
two years, three months
and
5.5 %, respectively. During the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022, the cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities related to the Company’s operating leases was $ 113,513 , which is included as an operating cash outflow within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. During the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022, the operating lease costs related to the Company’s operating leases was $ 114,617
which is included in operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The future minimum payments under operating leases were as follows for the fiscal periods ended March 31: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2023 ​ $

Management determined that recently issued ASU’s did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2022. ​ ​ 13
Table of Contents ITEM 2 .     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ​ As used throughout this Report, “we,” “our,” “the Company” “USI” and similar words refers to Universal Security Instruments, Inc. ​ FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ​ This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations with respect to our operations, performance, financial condition, and other developments. These forward-looking statements may generally be identified by the use of the words “may”, “will”, “believes”, “should”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, and similar expressions. These statements are necessarily estimates reflecting management’s best judgment based upon current information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and readers are advised that various factors could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected. While it is impossible to identify all such factors, such factors include, but are not limited to, those risks identified in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ​ OVERVIEW ​ We are in the business of marketing and distributing safety and security products. Our financial statements detail our sales and other operational results for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. ​ In light of the shutdowns, quarantines and other restrictions and delays in operations and travel caused by or related to COVID-19 in Hong Kong, the PRC and the United States, the Company has experienced delays in shipping and receiving of products. ​ As the Company’s products are sold primarily to the construction industry and do-it-yourself centers, restrictions and limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have had a negative impact on the Company’s sales. The Company is not yet able to quantify the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its sales and financial results. ​ The Company has developed products based on new smoke and gas detection technologies, with what the Company believes are improved sensing technology and product features. Most of our new technologies and features have been trademarked under the trade name IoPhic. ​ Changes in international trade duties and other aspects of international trade policy, both in the U.S. and abroad, could materially impact the cost of our products. All of our products are imported from the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). To date, only certain of our products such as Carbon Monoxide and Photoelectric alarms, and wiring devices, have been subjected to tariffs of 25%. We are monitoring these developments and will determine our strategies as additional information becomes available. Any increase in tariffs that is not offset by an increase in our sales prices could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ​ As previously reported, on February 25, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company (USI), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company D-U Merger Sub, Inc. a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”) and Infinite Reality, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Infinite Reality”). On May 16, 2022, the Company filed with the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) a proxy statement and Form S-4 registration statement in connection with the Merger. On December 12, 2022, Infinite Reality terminated the Merger Agreement. ​ RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ​ Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Sales.
Net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022, were $5,758,661 compared to $5,319,014 for the comparable three months in the prior year, an increase of $439,647 (8.3%). Sales increased principally due to the Company’s ability to fill orders as delays in unloading inventory at California ports of entry continued to abate during the period. Gross Profit Margin.
Gross profit margin is calculated as net sales less cost of goods sold expressed as a percentage of net sales. Our gross profit margin was 29.5% and 32.3% of sales for the quarters ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Gross margins
14
Table of Contents were negatively impacted in the period ended December 31, 2022, principally due to increases in the cost of certain electronic components and due to the mix of products sold. ​ Expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,178,502 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1,569,746 for the comparable three months in the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, these expenses decreased to 20.5% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, from 29.5% for the 2021 period. These expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales principally due to a reduction in salaries expense, a reduction in legal and consulting expenditures related to the potential merger, and a reduction in freight, and other selling expenditures. ​ Research and development expenses were comparable at $101,670 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, to $97,370 for the comparable quarter of the prior year. ​ Interest Expense.
Our interest expense was $76,755 for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, compared to interest expense of $14,156 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. Interest expense is dependent upon the total amounts borrowed from the Factor and the increase in interest rates during the period as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. ​ Net Income.
We reported net income of $341,312 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to a net income of $35,351 for the corresponding quarter of the prior fiscal year, a $305,961 (865.5%) increase in net income. The primary reasons for the increase in the net income is supply chain disruptions have begun to abate resulting in higher sales and due to reduced selling, general, and administrative expense as described above. ​ Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Sales.
Net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, were $16,251,106 compared to $15,259,235 for the comparable nine months in the prior period, an increase of $991,871 (6.5%). Sales increased principally due to the Company’s ability to fill orders as delays in unloading inventory at California ports of entry began to abate during the period. ​ Gross Profit Margin.
The gross profit margin is calculated as net sales less cost of goods sold expressed as a percentage of net sales. The Company’s gross profit margin was 28.8% for the period ended December 31, 2022, and 29.8% for the period ended December 31, 2021. Gross margins were negatively impacted in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022, principally due to increases in the cost of certain electronic components and due to the mix of products sold. Expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $3,750,348 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $4,059,988 for the comparable nine months in the prior year. As a percentage of sales, these expenses were 23.1% for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022, and 26.6% for the comparable 2021 period. These expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales principally due to a reduction in salaries expense resulting from recording an employee retention credit of $181,000 under the CARES Act, and a reduction in work force. These expenses also decreased due to a reduction in legal and consulting expenditures related to the potential merger. ​ Research and development expenses were comparable at $294,177 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, to $295,496 for the comparable period of the prior year. ​ Interest Expense.
Our interest expense was $200,776 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to interest expense of $37,954 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Interest expense is dependent upon the total amounts borrowed from the Factor and the increase in interest rates during the period as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. ​ Net Income.
We reported net income of $435,776 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a net income of $157,688 for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase in the net income of $278,088 (176.4%). The primary reasons for the increase in the net income is supply chain disruptions have begun to abate resulting in higher sales. In addition, the Company recorded a reduction in salaries expense resulting from an Employee Retention Credit under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and Economic Security Act, and due to reduced selling, general, and administrative expense as described above. ​ 15
Table of Contents Management Plans and Liquidity ​ In light of the shutdowns, quarantines and other restrictions and delays in operations and travel caused by or related to COVID-19 in Hong Kong, the PRC and the United States, the Company has experienced delays during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, in shipping and receiving of products.
​ ​ Our short-term borrowings to finance any operating losses, trade accounts receivable, and foreign inventory purchases are provided pursuant to the terms of its Factoring Agreement with Merchant Factors Corporation (Merchant or Factor). Borrowings under the Factoring Agreement bear interest at prime plus 2% and are secured by trade accounts receivable and inventory. Advances from Merchant are at the sole discretion of Merchant based on Merchant’s assessment of the Company’s receivables, inventory, and financial condition at the time of each request for an advance. The Company had no availability on this facility on December 31, 2022. The Company’s non-factored trade and other accounts receivable net of allowance for uncollectible amounts totaled $817,589 on December 31, 2022. ​ The Company’s factor has withheld financing on approximately $725,000 of the Company’s accounts receivable subject to resolution of any disputes. The resolution of disputed items is ongoing and subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company continues to provide support for resolution of any disputed items. The Company expects that all amounts in dispute will be resolved satisfactorily. In addition, the Company has filed requests for refunds of customs payments with US Customs and Border Protection for approximately $300,000 (including interest expected) for overpayments of tariff. The Company expects this refund to be available during either the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, or the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. Though no assurances can be given, if management’s plan continues to be successful over the next twelve months, the Company anticipates that it should be able to meet its cash needs for the next twelve months following the issuance date of this report. Cash flows and credit availability is expected to be adequate to fund operations for one year from the issuance date of this report. ​ Operating activities provided cash of $347,270 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. This was primarily due to net income of $435,776, a decrease in inventories, prepaid expenses and other assets of $1,719,546, and a decrease in accounts receivable and amount due from factor of $98,698. This was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1,921,596. Operating activities used cash of $2,111,908 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. This was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and amounts due from factor of $1,657,549, an increase in inventories, prepaid expenses and other of $808,245, and partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $189,243, and net income of $157,688. ​ There were no investing activities for the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022, or 2021. ​ Financing activities used cash of $585,850 during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, from net borrowing in excess of repayments from the factor of $314,150, offset by repayments of the note payable to Eyston Company, Ltd. of $900,000. Financing activities provided cash of $2,338,527 during the nine months ended December 31, 2021, from net borrowing in excess of repayments from the factor. ​ CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ​ In the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and in “Item 7.

Table of Contents ITEM 4 . CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ​ Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures ​ We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as such item is defined in Rules 13a – 15(e) and 15d – 15(e) of the Exchange Act) that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely manner. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated this system of disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with applicable Securities and Exchange Commission guidance as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report and have concluded that disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, because of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as discussed below. ​ A material weakness arose in the classification of and disclosure of amounts within the financial statements. The Company plans to remediate the material weakness by clarification of the classification of amounts and inclusion of the required disclosures. ​ Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting ​ There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ​ ​ 17
