securities AFS in an unrealized loss position. All of the mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2022 were government guaranteed. Management assessed each investment security with unrealized losses for credit loss and determined substantially all unrealized losses on these securities were due to credit spreads and interest rates versus credit loss. As part of that assessment, management evaluated and concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not be required and does not intend to sell any of the securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost. At December 31, 2022, there was no allowance for credit losses ("ACL") for debt securities AFS. 10 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities by contractual maturity are shown below. Certain securities have call features that allow the issuer to call the security prior to maturity. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities in MBS because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Therefore, MBS are not included in the maturity categories in the following maturity summary. The expected maturities of certain Small Business Administration ("SBA") securities may differ from contractual maturities because the borrowers may have the right to prepay the obligation. However, certain prepayment penalties may apply.

million at December 31, 2022 and $ 2.9
million at September 30, 2022 in marketable equity securities. The Company recognized
zero
and $ 2.3
million in unrealized loss on marketable equity securities during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which is attributable to an investee becoming publicly traded during fiscal year 2021. All other marketable equity securities and related activity were insignificant for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. No such securities were sold during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Non-marketable equity securities with a readily determinable fair value totaled $ 7.8
million at December 31, 2022 and $ 7.2
million at September 30, 2022. The Company recognized $ 0.1
million in unrealized gains and $ 0.3
million in unrealized losses
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No such securities were sold during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair value totaled $ 18.2
million at December 31, 2022 and $ 18.2
million at September 30, 2022. No such securities were sold during the three months ended December 31, 2022 . Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB") Stock The Bank is required by federal law to subscribe to capital stock (divided into shares of $100 each) as a member of the FRB of Minneapolis with an amount equal to six per centum of the paid-up capital stock and surplus. One-half of the subscription is paid at time of application, and one-half is subject to call of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. FRB of Minneapolis stock held by the Bank totaled $ 19.7
million at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. These equity securities are 'restricted' in that they can only be owned by member banks.
Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") Stock The Company's borrowings from the FHLB are secured by specific investment securities. Such advances can be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities.
The investments in the FHLB stock are required investments related to the Company's membership in and current borrowings from the FHLB of Des Moines. The investments in the FHLB of Des Moines could be adversely impacted by the financial operations of the FHLB and actions of their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 11 Table of Contents The FHLB stock is carried at cost since it is generally redeemable at par value. The carrying value of the stock held at the FHLB was $ 9.1
million at December 31, 2022 and at September 30, 2022. These equity securities are ‘restricted’ in that they can only be sold back to the respective institution from which they were acquired or another member institution at par. Therefore, FRB and FHLB stocks are less liquid than other marketable equity securities, and the fair value approximates cost.
Equity Security Impairment The Company evaluates impairment for investments held at cost on at least an annual basis based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. All other equity investments, including those under the equity method, are reviewed for other-than-temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis. The Company recognized
no
impairment for such investments for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. NOTE 5.

Although macroeconomic conditions and markets have improved since the beginning of 2021, other factors have been affecting the economic environment in 2022 including geopolitical conflict, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and rising interest rates. While the ultimate impact of the pandemic and these other factors on the Company's loan and lease portfolio remains difficult to predict, management continues to evaluate the loan and lease portfolio in order to assess the impact on repayment sources and underlying collateral that could result in additional losses and the impact to our customers and businesses as a result of COVID-19 and other factors impacting the economy and will refine its estimate as developments occur and more information becomes available.

For commercial finance, collateral dependent financial assets have collateral in the form of cash, equipment, or other business assets. Management has identified certain structured finance credits for alternative energy projects in which a substantial cash collateral account has been established to mitigate credit risk. Due to the nature of the transactions and significant cash collateral positions, these credits are evaluated individually. The balance of these pass rated cash collateral loans totaled $ 153.0  million and $ 120.7  million at December 31, 2022 and at September 30, 2022, respectively. Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities considered by the Bank's primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”), to be of lesser quality as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” The loan classification and risk rating definitions are as follows: Pass - A pass asset is of sufficient quality in terms of repayment, collateral and management to preclude a special mention or an adverse rating.   Watch - A watch asset is generally a credit performing well under current terms and conditions but with identifiable weakness meriting additional scrutiny and corrective measures. Watch is not a regulatory classification but can be used to designate assets that are exhibiting one or more weaknesses that deserve management’s attention. These assets are of better quality than special mention assets. 15 Table of Contents Special Mention - A special mention asset is a credit with potential weaknesses deserving management’s close attention and, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. Special mention is a temporary status with aggressive credit management required to garner adequate progress and move to watch or higher.   The adverse classifications are as follows:   Substandard - A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the net worth and/or repayment ability or by a weak collateral position. Assets so classified will have well-defined weaknesses creating a distinct possibility the Bank will sustain some loss if the weaknesses are not corrected. Loss potential does not have to exist for an asset to be classified as substandard. Doubtful - A doubtful asset has weaknesses similar to those classified substandard, with the degree of weakness causing the likely loss of some principal in any reasonable collection effort. Due to pending factors, the asset’s classification as loss is not yet appropriate. Loss - A loss asset is considered uncollectible and of such little value that the asset’s continuance on the Bank’s balance sheet is no longer warranted. This classification does not necessarily mean an asset has no recovery or salvage value leaving room for future collection efforts. Loans and leases, or portions thereof, are generally charged off when collection of principal becomes doubtful. Typically, this is associated with a delay or shortfall in payments of 210 days or more for commercial insurance premium finance, 120 days or more for consumer credit products and leases, and 90 days or more for commercial finance loans. Action is taken to charge off electronic return originator ("ERO") loans if such loans have not been collected by the end of June and refund advance loans if such loans have not been collected by the end of the calendar year. Nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructurings are generally individually evaluated for expected credit losses. The Company recognizes that concentrations of credit may naturally occur and may take the form of a large volume of related loans and leases to an individual, a specific industry, or a geographic location. Credit concentration is a direct, indirect, or contingent obligation that has a common bond where the aggregate exposure equals or exceeds a certain percentage of the Company’s Tier 1 Capital plus the allowable Allowance for Credit Losses. The Company has various portfolios of consumer finance and tax services loans that present unique risks that are statistically managed. Due to the unique risks associated with these portfolios, the Company monitors other credit quality indicators in their evaluation of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on these portfolios, and as such, these loans are not included in the asset classification table below. The outstanding balances of consumer finance loans and tax services loans were $ 186.9
million and $ 30.4
million at December 31, 2022, respectively, and $ 169.7
million and $ 9.1
million at September 30, 2022, respectively.

The following table provides the average recorded investment in nonaccrual loans and leases: Three Months Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Term lending $ 8,796   $ 13,922   Asset based lending 4,272   4,011   Factoring 708   12,247   Lease financing 3,623   3,033   SBA/USDA 1,420   216   Commercial finance 18,819   33,429   Total loans and leases $ 18,819   $ 33,429   The recognized interest income on the Company's nonaccrual loans and leases for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was not significant. The Company’s troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") typically involve forgiving a portion of interest or principal on existing loans, making loans at a rate materially less than current market rates, or extending the term of the loan. No loans were modified in a TDR during the three months ended December 31, 2022. There were $ 10.1
million of commercial finance loans and $ 0.1
million of consumer finance loans that were modified in a TDR during the three months ended December 31, 2021, all of which were modified to extend the term of the loan.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 0.1
million of commercial finance loans that were modified in a TDR within the previous 12 months and for which there was a payment default. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company had $ 2.3
million of commercial finance loans and $ 0.5
million of consumer finance loans that were modified in a TDR within the previous 12 months and for which there was a payment default. TDR net charge-offs and the impact of TDRs on the Company's allowance for credit losses were insignificant during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 21 Table of Contents NOTE 6.
EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE ("EPS") The Company has granted restricted share awards with dividend rights that are considered to be participating securities. Accordingly, a portion of the Company’s earnings is allocated to those participating securities in the earnings per share calculation under the two-class method. Basic EPS is computed using the two-class method by dividing income available to common stockholders after the allocation of dividends and undistributed earnings to the participating securities by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is calculated using the more dilutive of the treasury stock method or the two-class method. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised, and is computed after giving consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of the Company’s stock options, performance share units, and nonvested restricted stock, where applicable. Diluted EPS under the two-class method also considers the allocation of earnings to the participating securities. Antidilutive securities are disregarded in earnings per share calculations. Diluted EPS shown below reflects the two-class method, as diluted EPS under the two-class method was more dilutive than under the treasury stock method. A reconciliation of net income and common stock share amounts used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is presented below. Three Months Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 2022 2021 Basic income per common share: Net income attributable to Pathward Financial, Inc. $ 27,842   $ 61,324   Dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities ( 403 ) ( 953 ) Basic net earnings available to common stockholders 27,439   60,371   Undistributed earnings allocated to nonvested restricted stockholders 383   929   Reallocation of undistributed earnings to nonvested restricted stockholders ( 382 ) ( 929 ) Diluted net earnings available to common stockholders $ 27,440   $ 60,371   Total weighted-average basic common shares outstanding 28,024,541   30,238,621   Effect of dilutive securities (1) Performance share units 62,282   22,034   Total effect of dilutive securities 62,282   22,034   Total weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding 28,086,823   30,260,655   Net earnings per common share: Basic earnings per common share $ 0.98   $ 2.00   Diluted earnings per common share (2) $ 0.98   $ 2.00   (1)

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Repurchase of Common Stock The Company's Board of Directors authorized the September 3, 2021 share repurchase program to repurchase up to
6,000,000
shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. This authorization is effective from September 3, 2021 through September 30, 2024. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company repurchased
653,994
and
1,711,501
shares, respectively, as part of the share repurchase programs. Under the repurchase programs, repurchased shares were retired and designated as authorized but unissued shares. The Company accounts for repurchased shares using the par value method under which the repurchase price is charged to paid-in capital up to the amount of the original proceeds of those shares. When the repurchase price is greater than the original issue proceeds, the excess is charged to retained earnings. As of December 31, 2022,
3,640,983
shares of common stock remained available for repurchase. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company also repurchased

STOCK COMPENSATION The Company maintains the Pathward Financial, Inc. 2002 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "2002 Omnibus Incentive Plan"), which, among other things, provides for the awarding of stock options, nonvested (restricted) shares, and performance share units ("PSUs") to certain officers and directors of the Company. Awards are granted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors based on the performance of the award recipients or other relevant factors. Compensation expense for share-based awards is recorded over the vesting period at the fair value of the award at the time of the grant. The exercise price of options or fair value of nonvested (restricted) shares and performance share units granted under the Company’s 2002 Omnibus Incentive Plan is equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date, adjusted for dividends where applicable. The Company has elected, with the adoption of ASU 2016-09, to record forfeitures as they occur.
The following tables show the activity of nonvested (restricted) shares and PSUs granted, vested, or forfeited under the 2002 Omnibus Incentive Plan for the three months ended December 31, 2022. There were
no
options granted, exercised, or forfeited under this plan during the three months ended December 31, 2022. (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Number of Shares Weighted Average Fair Value at Grant Nonvested shares outstanding, September 30, 2022 474,348   $ 36.52   Granted 135,417   36.68   Vested ( 181,240 ) 34.71   Forfeited or expired ( 1,017 ) 41.82   Nonvested shares outstanding, December 31, 2022 427,508   $ 37.32   Performance share units outstanding, September 30, 2022 96,689   $ 42.59   Granted (1) 59,115   38.94   Vested —   —   Forfeited or expired —   —   Performance share units outstanding, December 31, 2022 155,804   $ 41.20   (1)
The number of PSUs granted reflects the target number of PSUs able to be earned under a given award. At December 31, 2022, stock-based compensation expense not yet recognized in income totaled $ 10.9
million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining period of
1.73
years. NOTE 12.
INCOME TAXES The Company recorded an income tax expense of $ 6.6
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, resulting in an effective tax rate of
18.79 %, compared to an income tax expense of $ 14.3
million, or an effective tax rate of
18.89 %, for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The Company’s effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily because of the anticipated effect of investment tax credits during fiscal year 2023. The Company's effective tax rate in the future will depend in part on actual investment tax credits generated from qualified solar energy property. 26 Table of Contents The table below compares the income tax expense components for the periods presented.

These revenues are not within the scope of Topic 606. Additional details are included in other footnotes to the accompanying financial statements. The scope of Topic 606 explicitly excludes net interest income as well as many other revenues for financial assets and liabilities, including loans, leases, and securities. Following is a discussion of key revenues within the scope of Topic 606. The Company provides services to customers that have related performance obligations that must be completed to recognize revenue. Revenues are generally recognized immediately upon the completion of the service or over time as services are performed. Any services performed over time generally require that the Company renders services each period; therefore, the Company measures progress in completing these services based upon the passage of time. Revenue from contracts with customers did not generate significant contract assets and liabilities. 27 Table of Contents Refund Transfer Product Fees.
Refund transfer fees are specific to the Banking as a Service ("BaaS") business line and reflect product fees offered by the Company through third-party tax preparers and tax preparation software providers where the Company acts as the partnering financial institution. A refund transfer allows a taxpayer to pay tax preparation and filing fees directly from their federal or state government tax refund, with the remainder of the refund being disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the taxpayer agreement, which may include satisfaction of other disbursement obligations before going directly to the taxpayer via check, direct deposit, or prepaid card. Refund transfer fees are recognized by the Company immediately after the taxpayer's refund has been disbursed in accordance with the contract and is based on standalone pricing included within the terms and conditions. Certain expenses to tax preparation software providers are netted with refund transfer fee income as the Company is considered the agent in these contractual relationships. All refund transfer fees are recorded within the Consumer reporting segment. Card and Deposit Fees.
Card fees relate to the BaaS business line and consists of income from prepaid cards and merchant services, including interchange fees from prepaid cards processed through card association networks, merchant services and other card related services. Interchange rates are generally set by card association networks based on transaction volume and other factors. Since interchange fees are generated by cardholder activity, the Company recognizes the income as transactions occur. Fee income for merchant services and other card related services reflect account management and transaction fees charged to merchants for processing card association network transactions. The associated income is recognized as transactions occur or as services are performed. For the Company's internally managed prepaid card programs, fees are based on standalone pricing within the terms and conditions of the cardholder agreement. The Company is considered the principal of these relationships resulting in all fee income being presented on a gross basis within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the Company's sponsorship prepaid card programs where a third-party is considered the Program Manager, the fees are based on standalone pricing within the terms and conditions of the Program Agreement. For these relationships, the Company is considered the agent and certain expenses with the Program Manager, networks and associations are netted with card fee revenue. All card fee income is included in the Consumer reporting segment. Deposit fees relate to the BaaS and Commercial Finance business lines and consist of income from banking and deposit-related services, including account services, overdraft protection, and wire transfers. Fee income for account services is recognized over the course of the month as the performance obligation is satisfied. Fee income for overdraft protection and wire transfers is recognized point in time when such event occurs. For BaaS, the fees for account services and overdraft protection are based on standalone pricing within the terms and conditions of the Program Agreement with the sponsorship partner. For these relationships, the Company is considered the agent and certain expenses with the partner are netted with deposit fee revenue. For Commercial Finance, fees for wire transfers are based on standalone pricing within the terms and conditions of the customer deposit agreement. Bank and deposit fees for the BaaS and Commercial Finance business lines are included in the Consumer and Commercial reporting segments, respectively. Also included within Card and Deposit Fees for the Consumer reporting segment are servicing fees the Company recognizes for custodial off-balance sheet deposits. This fee income is for services the Bank performs to maintain records of cardholder funds placed at one or more third-party banks insured by the FDIC. The servicing fee is typically reflective of the effective federal funds rate ("EFFR"). NOTE 14.
SEGMENT REPORTING An operating segment is generally defined as a component of a business for which discrete financial information is available and whose results are reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker. Operating segments are aggregated into reportable segments if certain criteria are met. The Company reports its results of operations through the following
three
business segments: Consumer, Commercial, and Corporate Services/Other. The BaaS business line is reported in the Consumer segment. The Commercial Finance business line is reported in the Commercial segment. The Corporate Services/Other segment includes certain shared services as well as treasury related functions such as the investment portfolio, warehouse finance, wholesale deposits and borrowings.

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurements
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities using a hierarchy system and requires disclosures about fair value measurement. It clarifies that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 Inputs
- Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at measurement date. Level 2 Inputs
- Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 3 Inputs
- Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market and are used only to the extent that observable inputs are not available. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company’s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Debt Securities Available for Sale and Held to Maturity . Debt securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and debt securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of debt securities available for sale, categorized primarily as Level 2, is recorded using prices obtained from independent asset pricing services that are based on observable transactions, but not quoted markets. Management reviews the prices obtained from independent asset pricing services for unusual fluctuations and compares to current market trading activity. Equity Securities.
Marketable equity securities and certain non-marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair values of marketable equity securities are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1 inputs). 29 Table of Contents The following tables summarize the fair values of debt securities available for sale and equity securities as they are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.   At December 31, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Debt securities AFS         Corporate securities $ 21,312   $ —   $ 21,312   $ —   SBA securities 95,765   —   95,765   —   Obligations of states and political subdivisions 2,351   —   2,351   —   Non-bank qualified obligations of states and political subdivisions 258,052   —   258,052   —   Asset-backed securities 135,276   —   135,276   —   Mortgage-backed securities 1,335,022   —   1,335,022   —   Total debt securities AFS $ 1,847,778   $ —   $ 1,847,778   $ —   Common equities and mutual funds (1) $ 3,437   $ 3,437   $ —   $ —   Non-marketable equity securities (2) $ 7,822   $ —   $ —   $ —   (1)

Loans and Leases.  The Company does not record loans and leases at fair value on a recurring basis. However, if a loan or lease is individually evaluated for risk of credit loss and repayment is expected to be solely provided by the values of the underlying collateral, the Company measures fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is determined by the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell. The fair value of the collateral is determined based on the internal estimates and/or assessment provided by third-party appraisers and the valuation relies on discount rates ranging from

The Company generally relies on external appraisers to develop this information. Management reduced the appraised value by estimating selling costs and other inputs in a range of
15 % to
59 %. Management discloses the estimated fair value of financial instruments, including assets and liabilities on and off the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. These fair value estimates were made at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 based on relevant market information and information about financial instruments. Fair value estimates are intended to represent the price at which an asset could be sold or a liability could be settled. However, since there is no active market for certain financial instruments of the Company, the estimates of fair value are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties, and include matters of significant judgment. Changes in assumptions as well as tax considerations could significantly affect the estimated values. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value estimates are not intended to represent the underlying value of the Company, on either a going concern or a liquidation basis. 31 Table of Contents The following tables present the carrying amount and estimated fair value of the financial instruments held by the Company:   At December 31, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Carrying Amount Estimated

The Company’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “CASH.” The following discussion focuses on the consolidated financial condition of the Company at December 31, 2022, compared to September 30, 2022, and the consolidated results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements, and notes thereto, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and the related management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Business Highlights for the 2023 Fiscal First Quarter • During the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company recognized the remaining $10.0 million as part of the agreement with Beige Key, LLC to cease all use of the Meta name and trademarks. The $10.0 million was recognized as noninterest income as a gain on sale of trademarks. As part of the corporate rebrand, the Company recognized $3.7 million of pre-tax expenses related to rebranding efforts during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Since the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 through the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company has recognized $16.9 million in expenses related to rebranding efforts. The Company does not anticipate any further material expenses related to rebranding efforts. Financial Highlights for the 2023 Fiscal First Quarter • Total revenue for the first quarter was $149.8 million, a decrease of $8.4 million, or 5%, compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2022,
primarily driven by the $50.0 million gain on sale of trademarks recognized during the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in interest income and the $10.0 million gain on sale of trademarks recognized during the
first
quarter of fiscal year
2023 . • Net interest margin ("NIM")
increased 103 basis points
to 5.62% for the first quarter from 4.59% during the same period of last year. The prior year period was impacted by excess cash associated with the Company's participation in the U.S. Treasury Department's Economic Impact Program. • Total gross loans and leases at December 31, 2022 decreased $174.5 million, or 5%, to $3.51 billion compared to December 31, 2021 and decreased $26.6 million , or 1%,
when compared to September 30, 2022. The decrease compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to a reduction in warehouse finance loans and the sale of the $81.5 million student loan portfolio during the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter, partially offset by growth in the commercial finance portfolio.
The primary driver for the decrease on a linked quarter basis was the
reduction in warehouse finance loans. • During the fiscal 2023 first quarter, the Company repurchased 653,994 shares of common stock at an average share price of $38.10. FINANCIAL CONDITION At December 31, 2022, the Company’s total assets decreased by $88.2 million to $6.66 billion compared to September 30, 2022, primarily due to decreases of $35.1 million in securities available for sale, $26.6 million in total loans and leases, and $18.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total cash and cash equivalents was $369.2 million at December 31, 2022, decreasing from $388.0 million at September 30, 2022. The Company maintains its cash investments primarily in interest-bearing overnight deposits with the FHLB of Des Moines and the FRB. At December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any federal funds sold. 34 Table of Contents The Company's investment security balances decreased $36.2 million, or 2%, to $1.89 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to $1.92 billion at September 30, 2022, due to maturities and principal pay downs. The Company’s portfolio of securities customarily consists primarily of MBS, which have expected lives much shorter than the stated final maturity, non-bank qualified obligations of states and political subdivisions, which mature in approximately 15 years or less, and other tax exempt municipal mortgage related pass through securities which have average lives much shorter than their stated final maturities. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company made no purchases of investment securities. Loans held for sale at December 31, 2022 totaled $17.1 million, decreasing from $21.1 million at September 30, 2022. This decrease was driven by a reduction in consumer credit products held for sale at December 31, 2022 compared to September 30, 2022. Total gross loans and leases totaled $3.51 billion at December 31, 2022, as compared to $3.54 billion at September 30, 2022. The primary driver for the decrease on a linked quarter basis was a reduction in warehouse finance loans and commercial finance loans, partially offset by an increase in the consumer finance portfolio and the seasonal increase in tax services loans.
See Note 5 to the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Commercial finance loans, which comprised 86% of the Company's gross loan and lease portfolio, totaled $3.01 billion at
December 31, 2022 , reflecting a reduction of $16.8 million, or 1%, from
September 30, 2022. Through the Bank, the Company owns stock in the FHLB due to the Bank’s membership and participation in this banking system as well as stock in the Federal Reserve Bank. The FHLB requires a level of stock investment based on a pre-determined formula. The Company’s investment in these stocks was $28.8 million at December 31, 2022 and at September 30, 2022, as purchases were offset by redemptions of FHLB membership stock during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Total end-of-period deposits decreased 1% to $5.79 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to September 30, 2022, primarily driven by a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits of $68.0 million.
The Company's total borrowings decreased $1.1 million, or 3%, from $36.0 million at September 30, 2022 to $35.0 million at December 31, 2022.
At December 31, 2022, the Company’s stockholders’ equity totaled $659.1 million, an increase of $14.0 million, from $645.1 million at September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to a change in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"). The Company and Bank remained above the federal regulatory minimum capital requirements at December 31, 2022, and continued to be classified as well-capitalized, and in good standing with the regulatory agencies. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. Noninterest-bearing Checking Deposits.
The Company may hold negative balances associated with cardholder programs in the BaaS business line that are included within noninterest-bearing deposits on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Negative balances can relate to any of the following payments functions: – Prefundings: The Company deploys funds to cards prior to receiving cash (typically 2-3 days) where the prefunding balance is netted at a pooled partner level utilizing ASC 210-20. – Discount fundings: The Company funds cards in alignment to expected breakage values on the card. Consumers may spend more than is estimated. These discounts are netted at a pooled partner level using ASC 210-20. The majority of these discount fundings relate to a small number of partners, and analyzed on an ongoing basis. – Demand Deposit Account ("DDA") overdrafts: Certain programs offered allow cardholders traditional DDA overdraft protection services whereby cardholders can spend a limited amount in excess of their available card balance. When overdrawn, these accounts are re-classed as loans on the balance sheet within the Consumer Finance category. 35 Table of Contents The Company meets the Right of Set off criteria in ASC 210-20, Balance Sheet - Offsetting, for all payments negative deposit balances with the exception of DDA overdrafts. The following table summarizes the Company's negative deposit balances within the BaaS business line: (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Noninterest-bearing deposits $ 5,903,642  $ 5,916,142  Prefunding (292,943) (244,462) Discount funding (22,652) (15,991) DDA overdrafts (8,921) (8,587) Noninterest-bearing checking, net $ 5,579,126  $ 5,647,102  Custodial Off-Balance Sheet Deposits.
The Bank utilizes a custodial deposit transference structure for certain prepaid and deposit programs whereby the Bank, acting as custodian of cardholder funds, places a portion of such cardholder funds that are not needed to support near term settlement at one or more third-party banks insured by the FDIC (each, a “Program Bank”). Accounts opened at Program Banks are established in the Bank’s name as custodian, for the benefit of the Bank’s cardholders. The Bank remains the issuer of all cards and holder of all accounts under the applicable cardholder agreements and has sole custodial control and transaction authority over the accounts opened at Program Banks. The Bank maintains the records of each cardholder’s deposits maintained at Program Banks. Program Banks undergo robust due diligence prior to becoming a Program Bank and are also subject to continuous monitoring. In return for record keeping services at Program Banks, the Bank receives a servicing fee (“Servicing Fee”). For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized
$12.9 million
in servicing fee income as compared to an insignificant amount for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The Servicing Fee has been typically reflective of the EFFR upon a renegotiation of the contracts with Program Banks.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company managed $2.23 billion of customer deposits at other banks in its capacity as custodian. The balance of these deposits increased $915.9 million as of December 31, 2022 as compared to $1.31 billion at September 30, 2022 primarily due to seasonal activity. These deposits provide the Company with excess deposits that can earn record keeping service fee income, typically reflective of the EFFR.
Approximately 43% of the deposit portfolio as of December 31, 2022 are subject to variable card processing expenses that are derived from the terms of contractual agreements with certain BaaS partners. These agreements are tied to a rate index, typically the EFFR. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   General
The Company recorded net income of $27.8 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to net income of $61.3 million, or $2.00 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Total revenue for the
fiscal 2023
first quarter was $149.8 million, a decrease of $8.4 million, or 5%, compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by the
$50.0 million
gain on sale of trademarks recognized during the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in interest income and the
$10.0 million
gain on sale of trademarks recognized during the
three months ended December 31, 2022 . Net Interest Income Net interest income for the fiscal 2023 first quarter was $84.1 million, an increase of 17%, from the same quarter in fiscal 2022. The increase was mainly attributable to increased yields and an improved earning asset mix.
36 Table of Contents The
first
quarter average outstanding balance of loans and leases decreased
$182.1 million
compared to the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in warehouse finance loans and the sales of the remaining community bank and student loan portfolios, partially offset by an increase in the commercial finance loans.
The Company’s average interest-earning assets for the first fiscal quarter decreased by $249.2 million to $5.93 billion compared with the same quarter in fiscal 2022, primarily due to a reduction in cash balances as a result of high cash levels during the prior year period related to the Company's participation in government stimulus programs. The decrease in interest-earnings assets was partially offset by growth in total investments and commercial finance loans and leases. Fiscal 2023 first quarter NIM increased to 5.62% from 4.59% in the first fiscal quarter of last year. The overall reported tax equivalent yield (“TEY”) on average earning assets increased by 101 basis points to 5.70% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by an increase in loan and lease and investment securities yields, along with a decrease in lower-yielding cash balances. The yield on the loan and lease portfolio was 7.70% compared to 6.96% for the comparable period last year and the TEY on the securities portfolio was 2.76% compared to 1.58% for that same period. The Company's cost of funds for all deposits and borrowings averaged 0.07% during the fiscal 2023 first quarter, as compared to 0.08% during the prior year quarter. The Company's overall cost of deposits was 0.01% in the fiscal 2023 first quarter, the same as the prior year quarter.
37 Table of Contents The following tables present, for the periods indicated, the Company’s total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates. The balances presented in the table below are calculated on a daily average balance. Tax-equivalent adjustments have been made in yield on interest-bearing assets and net interest margin. Nonaccruing loans and leases have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.

Net interest margin expressed on a fully-taxable-equivalent basis ("net interest margin, tax-equivalent") is a non-GAAP financial measure. The tax-equivalent adjustment to net interest income recognizes the estimated income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets and adjusting for federal and state exemption of interest income. The Company believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin expressed on a fully taxable equivalent basis and, accordingly, believes the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure may be useful for peer comparison purposes. (3)
Included in the yield computation are net loan fees of $6.5 million and $8.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
38 Table of Contents Provision for Credit Losses The Company recognized a provision for credit losses of $9.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to $0.2 million of provision for credit losses expense for the comparable period in the prior fiscal year.
T he increase in provision for credit losses during the current quarter compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by the release of provision for credit losses related to the community bank portfolio during the prior year period.
Net charge-offs were $3.2 million
for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. Net charge-offs attributable to the commercial finance, tax services, and consumer finance portfolios for the current quarter were $2.0 million, $1.0 million, and $0.2 million, respectively. Noninterest Income Fiscal 2023 first quarter noninterest income decreased to $65.8 million from $86.6 million for the same period of the prior year.
The decrease was primarily attributable to the gain on sale of trademarks as the Company recognized a $10.0 million gain during the current quarter as compared to a $50.0 million gain during the same period of the prior year. The period over period decrease was partially offset by increases in card and deposit fee income, gain on sale of other, other income, and rental income. The increase in card and deposit fee income was primarily from servicing fee income on off-balance sheet deposits, which totaled $12.9 million during the
fiscal 2023 first quarter , as compared to an insignificant amount for the fiscal quarter ended
December 31, 2021 .
Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense increased 27% to $105.1 million for the fiscal 2023 first quarter, from $82.4 million for the same quarter last year.
The increase was primarily attributable to increases in card processing expense, compensation expense, legal and consulting expense, and operating lease equipment depreciation.
The card processing expense increase was due to structured agreements with BaaS partners. The amount of expense paid under those agreements is based on an agreed upon rate index that varies depending on the deposit levels, floor rates, market conditions, and other performance conditions. Generally, this rate index averages between 50% to 85% of the EFFR and reprices immediately upon a change in the EFFR. Approximately 43% of the deposit portfolio was subject to these higher card processing expenses. For the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, card processing expenses related to these structured agreements were $14.0 million, as compared to $0.1 million for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021. Income Tax Expense The Company recorded an income tax expense of $6.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 18.8%, for the fiscal 2023 first quarter, compared to income tax expense of $14.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 18.9%, for the first quarter last year. The current quarter decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to decreased earnings. The Company originated $11.4 million in solar leases during the fiscal 2023 first quarter, resulting in $3.1 million in total net investment tax credits. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company originated $21.2 million in solar leases resulting in $5.7 million in total net investment tax credits. Investment tax credits related to solar leases are recognized ratably based on income throughout each fiscal year. The timing and impact of future solar tax credits are expected to vary from period to period, and the Company intends to undertake only those tax credit opportunities that meet the Company's underwriting and return criteria. Asset Quality Generally, when a loan or lease becomes delinquent 90 days or more or when the collection of principal or interest becomes doubtful, the Company will place the loan or lease on a nonaccrual status and, as a result, previously accrued interest income on the loan or lease is reversed against current income. The loan or lease will generally remain on a non-accrual status until six months of good payment history has been established or management believes the financial status of the borrower has been significantly restored. Certain relationships in the table below are over 90 days past due and still accruing. The Company considers these relationships as being in the process of collection. Insurance premium finance loans, consumer finance and tax services loans are generally not placed on nonaccrual status but are instead written off when the collection of principal and interest become doubtful. Loans and leases, or portions thereof, are charged-off when collection of principal becomes doubtful. Generally, this is associated with a delay or shortfall in payments of greater than 210 days for insurance premium finance, 180 days for tax and other specialty lending loans, 120 days for consumer credit products and 90 days for other loans.
39 Table of Contents Action is taken to charge off ERO loans if such loans have not been collected by the end of June and refund advance loans if such loans have not been collected by the end of the calendar year. Nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructurings are generally considered impaired. The Company believes that the level of allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022 was appropriate and reflected probable losses related to these loans and leases; however, there can be no assurance that all loans and leases will be fully collectible or that the present level of the allowance will be adequate in the future. See the section below titled “Allowance for Credit Losses” for further information.   The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of the Company's nonperforming assets. (Dollars in thousands)
December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Nonperforming Loans and Leases Nonaccruing loans and leases:   Commercial finance $ 25,077  $ 13,375  Total nonaccruing loans and leases 25,077  13,375  Accruing loans and leases delinquent 90 days or more:   Commercial finance 13,281  4,142  Consumer finance 2,493  2,793  Tax services (1) —  8,873  Total accruing loans and leases delinquent 90 days or more 15,774  15,808  Total nonperforming loans and leases 40,851  29,183  Other Assets   Nonperforming operating leases 4,188  1,736  Foreclosed and repossessed assets: Commercial finance —  1  Total foreclosed and repossessed assets —  1  Total other assets 4,188  1,737  Total nonperforming assets $ 45,039  $ 30,920  Total as a percentage of total assets 0.68  % 0.46  % (1)
Certain tax services loans do not bear interest.   The Company's nonperforming loans and leases at December 31, 2022 were $40.9 million, representing 1.16% of total gross loans and leases, compared to $29.2 million, or 0.82% of total gross loans and leases at September 30, 2022. The increase in the nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets at December 31, 2022 compared to September 30, 2022, was driven by an increase in nonperforming loans in the commercial finance portfolio, primarily due to one lending relationship that moved to nonperforming during the period. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in nonperforming tax services loans due to seasonal timing. Classified Assets . Federal regulations provide for the classification of certain loans, leases, and other assets such as debt and equity securities considered by the Bank's primary regulator, the OCC, to be of lesser quality as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss,” with each such classification dependent on the facts and circumstances surrounding the assets in question. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the Bank will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such minimal value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
40 Table of Contents General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When assets are classified as “loss,” the Bank is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount. The Bank’s determinations as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances are subject to review by its regulatory authorities, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
On the basis of management’s review of its loans, leases, and other assets, at December 31, 2022, the Company had classified loans and leases of $199.4 million as substandard, $3.9 million as doubtful and none as loss. At September 30, 2022, the Company classified loans and leases of $203.7 million as substandard, $4.0 million as doubtful and none as loss.
Allowance for Credit Losses . The ACL represents management’s estimate of current credit losses expected to be incurred by the loan and lease portfolio over the life of each financial asset as of the balance sheet date. The Company individually evaluates loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets, which generally means loans and leases identified as troubled debt restructurings or loans and leases on nonaccrual status. All other loans and leases are evaluated collectively for credit loss. A reserve for unfunded credit commitments such as letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments is recorded in other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Individually evaluated loans and leases are a key component of the ACL. Generally, the Company measures credit loss on individually evaluated loans based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs, as the Company considers these financial assets to be collateral dependent. If an individually evaluated loan or lease is not collateral dependent, credit loss is measured at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan or lease initial effective interest rate. The Company's ACL totaled $52.6 million at December 31, 2022, an increase compared to $45.9 million at September 30, 2022. The increase in the ACL at December 31, 2022, when compared to September 30, 2022, was primarily due to a $4.7 million increase in the commercial finance portfolio, a $1.4 million increase in the consumer finance portfolio and a $0.6 million increase in the seasonal tax services loan portfolio. The following table presents the Company's ACL as a percentage of its total loans and leases. As of the Period Ended December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 June 30, 2022 March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Commercial finance 1.62  % 1.46  % 1.56  % 1.66  % 2.04  % Consumer finance 1.54  % 0.86  % 2.44  % 3.18  % 2.70  % Tax services 2.01  % 0.05  % 54.29  % 35.76  % 1.60  % Warehouse finance 0.10  % 0.10  % 0.10  % 0.10  % 0.10  % Total loans and leases 1.50  % 1.30  % 2.04  % 2.38  % 1.84  % Total loans and leases excluding tax services 1.50  % 1.30  % 1.44  % 1.59  % 1.84  % The Company's ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases increased to 1.50% at December 31, 2022 from 1.30% at September 30, 2022. The increase in the total loans and leases coverage ratio was primarily driven by the commercial and consumer finance portfolios. The increase in the commercial finance coverage ratio was primarily due to a specific reserve on an individually evaluated loan relationship while the increase in consumer finance was related to seasonal activity. The Company expects to continue to diligently monitor the ACL and adjust as necessary in future periods to maintain an appropriate and supportable level. 41 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The financial information contained within these financial statements is, to a significant extent, based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. Management has identified its critical accounting policies, which are those policies that, in management's view, are most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. These policies involve complex and subjective decisions and assessments. Some of these estimates may be uncertain at the time they are made, could change from period to period, and could have a material impact on the financial statements. A discussion of the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022. There were no significant changes to these critical accounting policies and estimates during the first three months of fiscal 2023. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company’s primary sources of funds are deposits, derived principally through its BaaS business line, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans and leases and mortgage-backed securities, and maturing investment securities. In addition, the Company utilizes wholesale deposit sources to provide temporary funding when necessary or when favorable terms are available. While scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable, deposit flows and early loan repayments are influenced by the level of interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. The Company uses its capital resources principally to meet ongoing commitments to fund maturing certificates of deposit and loan commitments, to maintain liquidity, and to meet operating expenses.  At December 31, 2022, the Company had unfunded loan and lease commitments of $1.24 billion. Management believes that loan repayment and other sources of funds will be adequate to meet its foreseeable short- and long-term liquidity needs. As U.S. banking organizations, the Company and the Bank are required to comply with the regulatory capital rules adopted by the Federal Reserve and the OCC (the "Capital Rules") that became effective on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain requirements and other provisions of the Capital Rules. Under the Capital Rules and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s and Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s and Bank’s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. The Capital Rules require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum ratios (set forth in the table below) of total risk-based capital and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and a leverage ratio consisting of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined). At December 31, 2022, both the Company and the Bank exceeded federal regulatory minimum capital requirements to be classified as well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action requirements. The Company and the Bank took the AOCI opt-out election; under the rule, non-advanced approach banking organizations were given a one-time option to exclude certain AOCI components. The tables below include certain non-GAAP financial measures that are used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies. Management reviews these measures along with other measures of capital as part of its financial analyses and has included this non-GAAP financial information, and corresponding reconciliation to total equity. The decrease in Tier 1 leverage capital ratio for the period is the result of higher quarterly average assets related to its seasonal tax business. Regulatory Capital is not affected by the unrealized loss on AOCI. The securities portfolio is made up of nearly all amortizing securities that should provide consistent cash flow and is not expected to require sales to realize the losses to fund future loan growth. 42 Table of Contents At December 31, 2022 Company Bank Minimum to be Adequately Capitalized Under Prompt Corrective Action Provisions Minimum to be Well Capitalized Under Prompt Corrective Action Provisions Tier 1 leverage capital ratio 8.37  % 8.68  % 4.00  % 5.00  % Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio 12.31  13.09  4.50  6.50  Tier 1 capital ratio 12.63  13.09  6.00  8.00  Total capital ratio 14.29  14.29  8.00  10.00  The following table provides a reconciliation of the amounts included in the table above for the Company.

The following table provides a reconciliation of tangible common equity and tangible common equity excluding AOCI, each of which is used in calculating tangible book value data, to total stockholders' equity. Each of tangible common equity and tangible common equity excluding AOCI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is commonly used within the banking industry.

The capital conservation buffer is exclusively composed of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and it applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios but not the leverage ratio. The required Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios with the buffer are currently 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively. 43 Table of Contents Based on current and expected continued profitability and subject to continued access to capital markets, we believe that the Company and the Bank will continue to meet the capital conservation buffer of 2.5% in addition to required minimum capital ratios. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Contractual Obligations "
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 for a summary of our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2022. There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of our business in contractual obligations from September 30, 2022 through December 31, 2022. Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. MARKET RISK The Company derives a portion of its income from the excess of interest collected over interest paid. The rates of interest the Company earns on assets and pays on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Market interest rates change over time. Accordingly, the Company’s results of operations, like those of most financial institutions, are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest rates and the Company’s ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is the Company’s only significant “market” risk. The Company monitors and measures its exposure to changes in interest rates in order to comply with applicable government regulations and risk policies established by the Board of Directors, and in order to preserve stockholder value. In monitoring interest rate risk, the Company analyzes assets and liabilities based on characteristics including size, coupon rate, repricing frequency, maturity date and likelihood of prepayment. The Company’s primary objective for its investment portfolio is to provide a source of liquidity for the Company. In addition, the investment portfolio may be used in the management of the Company’s interest rate risk profile. The investment policy generally calls for funds to be invested among various categories of security types and maturities based upon the Company’s need for liquidity, desire to achieve a proper balance between minimizing risk while maximizing yield, the need to provide collateral for borrowings, and the need to fulfill the Company’s asset/liability management goals. The Company believes that its growing portfolio of longer duration, low-cost deposits generated from its BaaS business line provides a stable and profitable funding vehicle, but also subjects the Company to greater risk in a falling interest rate environment than it would otherwise have without this portfolio. This risk is due to the fact that, while asset yields may decrease in a falling interest rate environment, the Company cannot significantly reduce interest costs associated with these deposits, which thereby compress the Company’s net interest margin.
A portion of the Company’s deposit balances are subject to variable card processing expenses, derived from contractual agreements with certain BaaS partners tied to a rate index, typically the EFFR. These costs reprice immediately upon a change in the application rate index.
The Bank, acting as custodian of cardholder funds, places a portion of such cardholder funds at one or more third-party banks insured by the FDIC (each, a “Program Bank”). These custodial deposits earn recordkeeping service fee income, typically reflective of the EFFR.   The Board of Directors and relevant government regulations establish limits on the level of acceptable interest rate risk at the Company, to which management adheres. There can be no assurance, however, that, in the event of an adverse change in interest rates, the Company’s efforts to limit interest rate risk will be successful.
44 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk (“IRR”) Overview.
The Company actively manages interest rate risk, as changes in market interest rates can have a significant impact on reported earnings. The Company's interest rate risk analysis is designed to compare income and economic valuation simulations in market scenarios designed to alter the direction, magnitude and speed of interest rate changes, as well as the slope of the yield curve. This analysis may not represent all impacts driven by changes in the interest rate environment. The Company does not currently engage in trading activities to control interest rate risk although it may do so in the future, if deemed necessary, to help manage interest rate risk. Earnings at risk and economic value analysis.
As a continuing part of its financial strategy, the Bank considers methods of managing an asset/liability mismatch consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of net interest income. In order to monitor interest rate risk, the Company has created an Asset/Liability Committee whose principal responsibilities are to assess the Bank’s asset/liability mix and implement strategies that will enhance income while managing the Bank’s vulnerability to changes in interest rates. The Company uses two approaches to model interest rate risk: Earnings at Risk (“EAR analysis”) and Economic Value of Equity (“EVE analysis”). Under EAR analysis, net interest income is calculated for each interest rate scenario and compared to the net interest income forecast in the base case. EAR analysis measures the sensitivity of interest-sensitive earnings over a one-year minimum time horizon. The results are affected by projected rates, prepayments, caps and floors. Management exercises its best judgment in making assumptions regarding events that management can influence, such as non-contractual deposit re-pricing, as well as events outside of management's control, such as customer behavior on loan and deposit activity and the effect that competition has on both lending and deposit pricing. These assumptions are subjective and, as a result, net interest income simulation results will differ from actual results due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, changes in market conditions, customer behavior and management strategies, among other factors. The Company performs various sensitivity analyses on assumptions of deposit attrition, loan prepayments, and asset re-pricing, as well as market-implied forward rates and various likely and extreme interest rate scenarios, including rapid and gradual interest rate ramps, rate shocks and yield curve twists. The EAR analysis used in the following table reflects the required analysis used no less than quarterly by management.

shows that total interest-sensitive income will change more rapidly than total interest-sensitive expense over the next year. IRR is a snapshot in time. The Company’s business and deposits are predictably cyclical on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis. The Company’s static IRR results could vary depending on which day of the week the month ends, primarily related to payroll processing and timing of when certain programs are prefunded and when the funds are received.
Under EVE analysis, the economic value of financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments is derived under each rate scenario. The economic value of equity is calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities, net of the impact of off-balance sheet instruments.

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures. EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Management, under the direction of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.   In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. The evaluation was performed under the direction of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to determine the effectiveness, as of December 31, 2022, of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, at December 31, 2022, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not designed effectively to ensure timely alerting of material information relating to the Company required to be included in the Company's periodic SEC filings. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021 and the fiscal third quarter of 2022, the Company identified control deficiencies related to access permissions in two loan systems which resulted in a lack of segregation of duties over disbursements in which select individuals had the ability to both initiate and approve disbursements indicating that the user access provisioning and user entitlement review monitoring controls did not function to a precise level to ensure segregation of duties was maintained. Management determined that the combination of user access provisioning and user entitlement review deficiencies represent a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting on the basis that the deficiencies could result in a misstatement potentially impacting the Company's financial statement accounts and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. REMEDIATION PLAN FOR REPORTED MATERIAL WEAKNESS Annual entitlement review for the loan system identified in the fourth quarter of 2021 was performed in March 2022 and no inappropriate access was identified. For the loan system identified with inappropriate system access in fiscal third quarter of 2022, management removed access for the individuals that had inappropriate access and performed testing of disbursements during the impacted period and did not identify any instances where the segregation of the disbursement over initiation and approval was not maintained. In May, management also implemented an IT application control to identify instances where the initiator and approver are the same to prevent disbursement from occurring.
The Company is in the midst of undergoing a broader risk assessment and other remediation actions, across all material applications, and is on track with the stated project plan. These remediation steps will strengthen the control environment surrounding user access controls.
46 Table of Contents INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable (not absolute) assurance that its objectives will be met. Furthermore, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management conducted an evaluation of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, there were changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the 1934 Act) that were reported in the prior fiscal year that are still under remediation and continue during the fiscal first quarter to which this report relates that could have materially affected the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting, as described above. 47 Table of Contents PATHWARD FINANCIAL, INC.
