Table of Contents OSI SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) ​ 1.
Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of OSI Systems, Inc. and our subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded in accordance with SEC rules and regulations and GAAP applicable to interim unaudited financial statements. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for audited annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal and recurring nature that are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 filed with the SEC. The results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full 2023 fiscal year or any future periods. ​ Use of Estimates ​ The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales, costs of sales and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant of these estimates and assumptions for our company relate to contract revenue, fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, values for inventories reported at lower of cost or net realizable value, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, accrued warranty costs, and the recoverability, useful lives and valuation of recorded amounts of long-lived assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Changes in estimates are reflected in the periods during which they become known. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, our actual amounts reported in future periods could differ materially from these estimates. ​ Earnings Per Share Computations ​ We compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted earnings per share by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and restricted stock unit awards under the treasury stock method. ​ The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share amounts): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      Three Months Ended December 31,       Six Months Ended December 31,  ​ ​ 2021      2022      2021      2022 Net income available to common stockholders ​ $

79 ​ Cash and Cash Equivalents ​ We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less as of the acquisition date to be cash equivalents. 9
Table of Contents Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $ 45.6
million at December 31, 2022. Of this amount, approximately
98 % was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations. These foreign funds were held primarily by our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico, Canada and India, and to a lesser extent in Indonesia, Albania and Australia. We have cash holdings in financial institutions that exceed insured limits for such financial institutions; we mitigate this risk, however, by utilizing international financial institutions of high credit quality. ​ Fair Value of Financial Instruments ​ Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, insurance company contracts, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt instruments, an interest rate swap contract and foreign currency forward contracts. The carrying values of financial instruments, other than long term debt instruments and the interest rate swap contract, are representative of their fair values due to their short-term maturities. The carrying values of our long-term debt instruments are considered to approximate their fair values because the interest rates of these instruments are variable or comparable to current rates for financing available to us. The fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were not significant as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. ​ Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Level 1 category includes assets and liabilities measured at quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

22,654 ​ Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity ​ Our use of derivatives consists of foreign currency forward contracts and an interest rate swap agreement. The foreign currency forward contracts are utilized to partially mitigate certain balance sheet exposures or used as a net investment hedge to protect against potential changes resulting from short-term foreign currency fluctuations. These contracts have original maturities of up to three months. We also manage our risk to changes in interest rates through the use of derivative instruments. We use fixed interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of the variable interest rate payments to fixed interest rate payments. We do not use hedging instruments for speculative purposes. ​ The net gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts, which are not designated as hedge instruments, are reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The amounts reported in the consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 were not significant. The fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts is estimated using a standard valuation model and market-based observable inputs over the contractual term. Unrealized gains are recognized as assets and unrealized losses are recognized as liabilities. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, we held foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling $ 22.9
million and $ 19.8
million, respectively. Unrealized gains and losses from our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 were not significant. 10
Table of Contents The interest rate swap agreement was entered into to improve the predictability of cash flows from interest payments related to our variable, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) based debt. The interest rate swap matures in December 2026. The interest rate swap is considered an effective cash flow hedge, and as a result, the net gains or losses on such instrument are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated financial statements and are reclassified as net income when the underlying hedged interest impacts earnings. A qualitative and quantitative assessment over the hedge effectiveness is performed on a quarterly basis, unless facts and circumstances indicate that the hedge may no longer be highly effective.
As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, the notional amount of the derivative instruments designated as an interest rate swap hedge was $ 0
and $ 175
million, respectively. The fair value of the interest rate swap contract as of December 31, 2022 was $ 3.3
million and is recorded in Other assets within the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
The effect of the cash flow hedges on other comprehensive income (loss) and earnings for the periods presented was as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      Three Months Ended December 31,       Six Months Ended December 31,  ​ ​ 2021      2022 ​ 2021      2022 Total interest and other expense, net presented in the condensed consolidated statements of operations in which the effects of cash flow hedges are recorded ​ $

( 29 ) ​ Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Revenue Contracts with Customers in a Business Combination In October 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2021-08, an accounting standard update to improve the accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts with customers in a business combination (Topic 805). This amendment improves comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired revenue contracts with customers at the date of and after a business combination. This authoritative guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2022 using the prospective approach and applied the amendments to the business combinations that occurred during the year ended June 30, 2022 and the six months ended December 31, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2021-08 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ​ 2. Business Combinations Under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805,
Business Combinations
(“ASC 805”), the acquisition method of accounting requires us to record assets acquired less liabilities assumed from an acquisition at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the total estimated purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired should be recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customers, acquired technology, trade names, useful lives and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions which are believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, as additional information that existed at the acquisition date becomes available for preliminary estimates, we may record adjustments to the preliminary assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any adjustments subsequent to the conclusion of such measurement period are reflected in reported earnings. Fiscal Year 2023 Business Acquisitions In December 2022, we (through our Security division) acquired in a bankruptcy proceeding certain assets of a provider of baggage and parcel inspection systems for approximately $ 1.6
million. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand. 11
Table of Contents In August 2022, we (through our Security division) acquired a privately held provider of training software and solutions for approximately $ 1.9
million plus an immaterial amount of potential contingent consideration. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand. The goodwill recognized for this business is not deductible for income tax purposes. Fiscal Year 2022 Business Acquisitions ​ In February 2022, we (through our Security division) acquired a privately held provider of intelligent inspection, sensory, and recognition solutions for approximately $ 14
million plus up to $ 25
million in potential contingent consideration. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving bank line of credit. The goodwill recognized for this business is not deductible for income tax purposes.
​ We (through our Security division) also acquired in February 2022 a privately held sales and services company for approximately $ 1.1
million, plus an immaterial amount of potential contingent consideration. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand. The goodwill recognized for this transaction is deductible for income tax purposes. ​ These business acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, pro forma historical results of operations and other disclosures related to these businesses have not been presented. ​ 3.

Software development costs incurred after establishing technological feasibility are capitalized on a product-by-product basis until the product is available for general release to customers at which time amortization begins. Annual amortization, charged to cost of goods sold, is the amount computed using the ratio that current revenues for a product bear to the total current and anticipated future revenues for that product. In the event that future revenues are not estimable, such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated economic life of the product. Amortizable assets that have not yet begun to be amortized are included in Thereafter in the table above. For the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, we capitalized software development costs in the amounts of $ 3.6

Table of Contents 5. Contract Assets and Liabilities ​ We enter into contracts to sell products and provide services, and we recognize contract assets and liabilities that arise from these transactions. We recognize revenue and corresponding accounts receivable according to ASC Topic 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(“ASC 606”). When we recognize revenue in advance of the point in time at which contracts give us the right to invoice a customer, we record this as unbilled revenue, which is included in accounts receivable, net, on the consolidated balance sheets. We may also receive consideration, per the terms of a contract, from customers prior to transferring control of goods to the customer. We record customer deposits as contract liabilities. Additionally, we may receive payments, most typically under service and warranty contracts, at the onset of the contract and before services have been performed. In such instances, we record a deferred revenue liability in either Other accrued expenses and current liabilities or Other long-term liabilities. We recognize these contract liabilities as sales after all revenue recognition criteria are met.
​ The table below shows the balance of contract assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, including the change between the periods. There were no substantial non-current contract assets for the periods presented.

3 % ​ Contract assets increased during the six months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to satisfaction of performance obligations for aviation, cargo and vehicle inspection customers in our Security division which have not yet been billed. The overall increase in contract liabilities was primarily due to receipt of upfront deposits from customers and deferred revenue from receipt of payments under service and warranty contracts primarily in our Security division. ​ Remaining Performance Obligations . Remaining performance obligations related to ASC 606 represent the portion of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations under an original contract with a term greater than one year which are fully or partially unsatisfied at the end of the period. As of December 31, 2022, the portion of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $ 338.9
million. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately
58 % of the remaining performance obligations over the next
12 months , and the remainder is expected to be recognized thereafter. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized revenue of $ 37.5
million from contract liabilities existing at the beginning of the period. ​ Practical Expedients.
In cases where we are responsible for shipping after the customer has obtained control of the goods, we have elected to treat the shipping activities as fulfillment activities rather than as a separate performance obligation. Additionally, we have elected to capitalize the cost to obtain a contract only if the period of
amortization
would be longer than one year. We only give consideration to whether a customer agreement has a
financing component
if the period of time between transfer of goods and services and customer payment is greater than one year. ​ 14

Table of Contents 8. Borrowings ​ Revolving Credit Facility ​ In December 2021, we entered into an amendment to the senior secured credit facility that increased the aggregate amount available to borrow from $ 535
million to $ 750
million. The amended facility matures in December 2026 and is comprised of a $ 600
million revolving credit facility and a $ 150
million delayed draw term loan. The revolving credit facility includes a $ 300
million sub-limit for letters of credit. Under certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, we have the ability to increase the revolving credit facility by the greater of $ 250
million or such amount as would not cause our secured leverage ratio to exceed a specified level. Borrowings under the amended facility bore interest at SOFR plus a margin of
1.25 % as of December 31, 2022 (which margin can range from
1.0 % to
1.75 % based on our consolidated net leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility). Letters of credit reduce the amount available to borrow under the credit facility by their face value amount. The unused portion of the facility bore a commitment fee of
0.15 % as of December 31, 2022 (which fee can range from
0.10 % to
0.25 % based on our consolidated net leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility). Our borrowings under the credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of our U.S.-based subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our assets and substantially all the assets of certain of our subsidiaries. The credit facility contains various representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default. As of December 31, 2022, there were $ 235
million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility, $ 66.8
million outstanding under the letters of credit sub-facility, and $ 146.9
million outstanding under the term loan. As of December 31, 2022, the amount available to borrow under the revolving credit facility was $ 298.2
million. Loan amounts under the revolving credit facility may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed during the term. The principal amount of each loan is due and payable in full on the maturity date. We have the right to repay each loan in whole or in part from time to time without penalty. It is our practice to routinely borrow and repay several times per year under the revolving facility and therefore, borrowings under the revolving credit facility are included in current liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under this credit facility. In September 2022, we entered into an interest rate swap in order to mitigate the interest rate risk on a portion of the interest payments expected to be made on the borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility and term loan. Refer to Note 1 for details. 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes (“Notes”) Due 2022 ​ In February 2017, we issued $ 287.5
million of the Notes in a private offering. The Notes were governed by an indenture dated February 22, 2017. The maturity date for the payment of principal was September 1, 2022. The Notes bore interest at the rate of
1.25 % and were payable in cash semiannually in arrears on each March 1 and September 1. On September 1, 2022, we repurchased and cancelled the then-remaining $ 242.3
million balance of the Notes utilizing proceeds from the senior secured credit facility. ​ Issuance costs of $ 7.7
million were allocated between debt ($ 6.5
million) and equity ($ 1.2
million) components with the portion allocated to the debt presented as an offset against long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet and was being amortized as interest expense over the life of the Notes using the effective interest method. Total interest expense recognized for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 related to the Notes was $ 1.2
and $ 2.5
million, respectively, which consisted of $ 0.9
million and $ 1.8
million of contractual interest expense and $ 0.3
million and $ 0.7
million of amortization of debt issuance costs. Total interest expense recognized for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 related to the Notes was
nil
and $ 0.7
million, respectively, which consisted of $ 0.5
million of contractual interest expense and $ 0.2
million of amortization of debt issuance costs. Other Borrowings ​ Several of our foreign subsidiaries maintain bank lines of credit, denominated in local currencies and U.S. dollars, primarily for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2022, $ 48.5
million was outstanding under these letter-of-credit facilities. As of December 31, 2022, the total amount available under these credit facilities was $ 20.5
million. ​ 17

85.29 ​ As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately
0.8
million shares available for grant under the OSI Plan. Under the terms of the OSI Plan, RSUs and restricted stock granted from the pool of shares available for grant reduce the pool by
1.87
shares for each award granted. RSUs and restricted stock forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by
1.87
shares for each award forfeited. ​ We granted
96,620
and
110,811
performance-based RSUs during the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. These performance-based RSU awards are contingent on the achievement of certain performance metrics. The payout related to these awards can range from
zero
to
376 % of the original number of shares or units awarded. Compensation cost associated with these performance-based RSUs are recognized based on the estimated number of shares that we ultimately expect will vest. If the estimated number of shares to vest is revised in the future, then stock-based compensation expense will be adjusted accordingly. ​ Stock Repurchase Program ​ In September 2022, our Board of Directors increased the stock repurchase authorization to a total of
2
million shares. This program does not expire unless our Board of Directors acts to terminate the program. The timing and actual numbers of shares purchased depends on a variety of factors, including stock price, general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities. Repurchases may be made from time to time under the program through open-market purchases or privately-negotiated transactions at our discretion. Upon repurchase, the shares are restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares and we record them in our consolidated financial statements as a reduction in the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. If additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero, we record the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value as a reduction of retained earnings. ​ During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased
261,761
shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2022, there were
1,860,339
shares remaining available for repurchase under the authorized repurchase program. ​ Dividends ​ We have not paid any cash dividends since the consummation of our initial public offering in 1997 and we do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our Board of Directors will determine the payment of future cash dividends, if any. Certain of our current bank credit facilities restrict the payment of cash dividends and future borrowings may contain similar restrictions. ​ 10. Commitments and Contingencies ​ Acquisition-Related Contingent Obligations ​ Under the terms and conditions of the purchase agreements associated with certain acquisitions, we may be obligated to make additional payments based on the achievement of certain sales or profitability milestones through the acquired operations. For agreements that contain contingent consideration obligations that are capped, the remaining maximum amount of such potential future payments is $ 50.0
million as of December 31, 2022. ​ We account for such contingent payments for acquisitions which occurred through the end of fiscal year 2009 as additions to the purchase price of the acquired business. We made contingent payments relating to such acquisitions of $ 1.0
million and $ 1.3
million, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 and $ 1.8
million and $ 2.2
million, respectively, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. ​ 19
Table of Contents For acquisitions completed after fiscal 2009, pursuant to ASC 805, the estimated fair value of these obligations is recorded as a liability at the time of the acquisition with subsequent revisions recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated financial statements. The estimated fair value measurements of contingent earnout obligations are primarily based on unobservable inputs, which may include projected revenues, gross margins, operating income and the estimated probability of achieving the earnouts. ​ These projections and probabilities are used to estimate future contingent earnout payments, which are discounted back to present value to compute contingent earnout liabilities.
The following table provides a roll-forward from June 30, 2022 to December 31, 2022 of the contingent consideration liability, which is included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Beginning fair value, June 30, 2022      $

22,660 ​ Environmental Contingencies ​ We are subject to various environmental laws. We conduct environmental investigations at our manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia-Pacific, and Europe, and, to the extent practicable, on all new properties in order to identify, as of the date of such investigation, potential areas of environmental concern related to past and present activities or from nearby operations. In certain cases, we have conducted further environmental assessments consisting of soil and groundwater testing and other investigations deemed appropriate by independent environmental consultants.
​ We have not accrued for loss contingencies relating to environmental matters because we believe that, although unfavorable outcomes are possible, they are not considered by our management to be probable and reasonably estimable. If one or more of these environmental matters are resolved in a manner adverse to us, the impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be material. ​ Indemnifications and Certain Employment-Related Contingencies ​ In the normal course of business, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, or intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential liability amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. We have not recorded any liability for costs related to contingent indemnification obligations as of December 31, 2022. ​ On December 31, 2017, we and Deepak Chopra, our Chief Executive Officer, entered into an amendment to Mr. Chopra’s employment agreement that, among other things, provides for a $ 13.5
million bonus payment to Mr. Chopra on or within
45 days
of January 1, 2024 contingent upon Mr. Chopra’s continued employment with us through that date, subject to accelerated payout terms in the event of Mr. Chopra’s death or disability. The bonus is recorded in the financial statements over the remaining term of the employment agreement and is included in other long-term liabilities. ​ Product Warranties ​ We offer our customers warranties on many of the products that we sell. These warranties typically provide for repairs and maintenance of the products if problems arise during a specified time period after original shipment. Concurrent with the sale of products, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses with a corresponding increase in cost of goods sold. We periodically adjust this provision based on historical experience and anticipated expenses. We charge actual expenses of repairs under warranty, including parts and labor, to this provision when incurred. The current obligation for warranty provision is included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities and the noncurrent portion is included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. ​ 20

10,734 ​ Legal Proceedings ​ We are involved in various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion after consultation with legal counsel, the ultimate disposition of such proceedings is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We have not accrued for loss contingencies relating to any such matters because we believe that, although unfavorable outcomes in the proceedings are possible, they are not considered by management to be probable and reasonably estimable. If one or more of these matters are resolved in a manner adverse to our company, the impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be material. ​ 11. Income Taxes ​ The determination of the annual effective tax rate is based upon a number of significant estimates and judgments, including the estimated annual pretax income in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate and the development of tax planning strategies during the year. In addition, as a global commercial enterprise, our tax expense can be impacted by changes in tax rates or laws, the finalization of tax audits and reviews and other factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. As such, there can be significant volatility in interim tax provisions. ​ The effective tax rates for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 were
26.3 % and
19.5 %, respectively. During the three month period ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a net discrete tax expense of $ 0.3
million related to equity-based compensation under ASU 2016-09 and changes in prior year tax estimates. During the three month period ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a net discrete tax benefit of $ 0.4
million related to equity-based compensation under ASU 2016-09 and a benefit of $ 0.4
million from changes in prior year estimates. The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 was
21.6 % for both periods. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a net discrete tax benefit of $ 1.8
million related to equity-based compensation under ASU 2016-09 partially offset by a discrete tax expense for changes in prior year tax estimates of $ 0.2
million .
During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized discrete tax benefit of $ 0.5
million related to equity-based compensation under ASU 2016-09 and $ 0.4
million from changes in prior year estimates . ​ 12. Segment Information ​ We have determined that we operate in
three
identifiable industry segments: (a) security and inspection systems (Security division), (b) medical monitoring systems (Healthcare division) and (c) optoelectronic devices and manufacturing (Optoelectronics and Manufacturing division). We also have a corporate segment (Corporate) that includes executive compensation and certain other general and administrative expenses, expenses related to stock issuances and legal, audit and other professional service fees not allocated to industry segments. Both the Security and Healthcare divisions comprise primarily end-product businesses, whereas the Optoelectronics and Manufacturing division primarily supplies components and subsystems to external OEM customers, as well as to the Security and Healthcare divisions. Sales between divisions are at transfer prices that approximate market values. All other accounting policies for the segments are the same as described in Note 1, Basis of Presentation. ​ 21

Forward-looking statements relate to our current expectations, beliefs, and projections concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words such as “project,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, information provided regarding impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve uncertainties, risks, assumptions and contingencies, many of which are outside our control.

Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations are disclosed in this report, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (including Part I, Item 1, “Business,” Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”) and other documents filed by us from time to time with the SEC. Such factors, of course, do not include all factors that might affect our business and financial condition. We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of delays related to the award of domestic and international contracts; failure to secure the renewal of key customer contracts; delays in customer programs; delays in revenue recognition related to the timing of customer acceptance; changes in domestic and foreign government spending, budgetary, procurement and trade policies adverse to our businesses; the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including the potential for broad economic disruption; global economic uncertainty; impacts on our business related to or resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic
such as material delays and cancellations of orders or deliveries thereon, supply chain disruptions, plant closures, or other adverse impacts on our ability to execute business plans ; unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations; effect of changes in tax legislation; market acceptance of our new and existing technologies, products and services; our ability to win new business and convert any orders received to sales within the same fiscal year; enforcement actions in respect of any noncompliance with laws and regulations including export control and environmental regulations and the matters that are the subject of some or all of our investigations and compliance reviews, contract and regulatory compliance matters, and actions, which if brought, could result in judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, debarment or penalties; and other risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those detailed herein and from time to time in our other SEC filings, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
Many of the referenced risks could be amplified by the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.
All forward-looking statements contained in this report are qualified in their entirety by this Section. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment and new risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur, and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We undertake no obligation other than as may be required under securities laws to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ​ 23

Table of Contents Trends and Uncertainties ​ The following is a discussion of certain trends and uncertainties that we believe have influenced, and may continue to influence, our results of operations. ​ Coronavirus Pandemic.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic, including the emergence of new variants, has dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment, with millions of confirmed cases, business slowdowns and shutdowns, and market volatility. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, significant economic disruptions and has impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, our operations and the operations of our suppliers, logistics providers and customers as a result of supply chain disruptions and delays, as well as labor challenges associated with employee absences, travel restrictions, site access, quarantine restrictions, remote work, and adjusted work schedules. Our ability to continue to operate without significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain and to keep our manufacturing facilities open and operating effectively. We have endeavored to implement government and health authority recommendations to protect our employees worldwide including with respect to vaccine administration. There is substantial uncertainty regarding the duration, scope, and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the early stages of the pandemic, our Healthcare division experienced increased demand for certain products as a result of COVID-19. In our Security division, throughout the pandemic, receipt of certain orders has been delayed, most notably with respect to our aviation and cargo products, and our revenues have been adversely impacted as a result of the pandemic. As many customers of our Security division continue to be impacted by the pandemic, we have received and could receive further requests to delay deliveries of equipment and modify service arrangements or the scheduling of factory or site acceptance tests, which has impacted, and could further impact, timing of revenue recognition. In addition, as a result of COVID-19 related government regulations, certain of our global manufacturing facilities have had to limit operations and might have to limit operations in the future. While we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets due primarily to materials shortages, longer lead times on deliveries and transportation constraints. If these business interruptions resulting from COVID-19 were to be prolonged or expanded in scope, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially and adversely impacted. We intend to continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in our best interests and the best interests of our employees, suppliers and customers. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial performance in future periods, including our ability to execute our programs in the expected timeframe, remains uncertain and will depend on future pandemic-related developments, including the duration of the pandemic, potential subsequent waves of COVID-19 infection or potential new variants, the effectiveness and adoption of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, supplier impacts and related government actions to prevent and manage disease spread, including the implementation of any federal, state, local or foreign vaccine mandates, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. The long-term impacts of COVID-19 on government budgets and other funding priorities, including international priorities, that impact demand for our products and services are also difficult to predict, but could negatively affect our future results and performance. Global Economic Considerations.
Our products and services are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with a large percentage of our sales generated outside the United States. Therefore, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. There is uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic factors in the U.S. and globally characterized by the supply chain environment, inflationary pressure, rising interest rates, and labor shortages. Further, global economic conditions continue to be highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, these other global macroeconomic factors, coupled with the U.S. political climate and political unrest internationally, have created uncertainty and impacted demand for certain of our products and services. Also, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the sanctions imposed in response to this conflict have increased global economic and political uncertainty. While the impact of these factors remains uncertain, we will continue to evaluate the extent to which these factors will impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We do not know how long this uncertainty will continue. These factors could have a material negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Global Trade.
In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, the current domestic and international political environment, including in relation to recent and further potential changes by the U.S. and other countries in policies on global trade and tariffs, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy and global trade. This uncertainty is exacerbated by sanctions imposed by the U.S. government against certain businesses and individuals in select countries. Continued or increased uncertainty regarding global trade due to these or other factors may require us to modify our current business practices and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ​ 25
Table of Contents Healthcare Considerations.
As described above, our Healthcare division experienced some increased demand for its patient monitoring products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during the earlier stages of the pandemic. Increased healthcare capital purchases made in prior periods may result in fewer capital purchases in subsequent periods. The pandemic may also impact our ability to manufacture product needed to timely fill orders if we experience supply chain disruptions or need to close any manufacturing facility due to employee COVID-19 cases or local government regulations. European Union Threat Detection Standards.
The EU has implemented regulations for all airports within the EU that use explosive detection systems to have hold baggage screening systems that are compliant with the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) Standard 3. The deadline for compliance with this mandate was initially set for September 2020. Given the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU revised the regulations, and the date by which airports using explosive detection systems for hold baggage screening must meet Standard 3 has been changed to March 2024, with certain larger airports required to meet earlier installation dates. Our Security division’s real time tomography (RTT) product has passed the ECAC explosive detection system Standard 3 threat detection requirement. Government Policies.
Our results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies, including U.S. and foreign government policies to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, such as travel restrictions or site closures. ​ Changes in Costs and Supply Chain Disruptions.
Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in raw material, component, and logistics costs. Our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including freight and shipping activities, have been and may continue to be impacted by increased vendor costs as well as the current global supply chain bottleneck. Specifically, we are impacted by the global shortage of electronic components and other materials needed for production and freight availability. We expect continued disruptions in obtaining material and freight availability as the world economies react to and recover from supply chain shortages. This increased cost environment has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to mitigate the impact of increased costs through pricing or other actions, there could be a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine.
The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the sanctions imposed in response to this conflict have increased global economic and political uncertainty. This has the potential to indirectly disrupt our supply chain and access to certain resources. While we have not experienced significant adverse impacts to date and will continue to monitor for any impacts and seek to mitigate disruption that may arise, we have certain research and development activities within Ukraine for our Healthcare division which have been somewhat impacted. The conflict also has increased the threat of malicious cyber activity from nation states and other actors. Currency Exchange Rates.
On a year-over-year basis, currency exchange rates negatively impacted reported sales by approximately 1.7% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies in 2022. Any further strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would adversely impact our sales for the remainder of the year, and any weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would positively impact our sales for the remainder of the year.

Table of Contents Revenues for the Security division during the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased year-over-year due to increases in product and service revenues of approximately $13.8 million and $7.7 million, respectively. The increase in both product and service revenue was primarily driven by increased sales of cargo and vehicle inspection systems which was partially offset by a decrease in aviation related revenues. ​ Revenues for the Healthcare division during the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased year-over-year due to a reduction in patient monitoring sales of $7.3 million due in part to elevated demand related to COVID in the prior year period, a decrease in cardiology sales of $1.4 million and a decrease in service revenue of $0.2 million.
​ Revenues for the Optoelectronics and Manufacturing division during the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased year-over year as a result of an increase in revenue in our optoelectronics business and contract manufacturing business of approximately $2.5 million and $3.8 million, respectively. ​ Gross Profit ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Q2 ​ % of ​ Q2 ​ % of ​ ​      Fiscal 2022      Net Revenues      Fiscal 2023      Net Revenues      Gross profit ​ $

Our cost of goods sold increased year-over-year primarily as a result of the increase in revenues and higher raw material costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 decreased on a year-over-year basis due to (i) a reduction in the Security division gross margins due to a decrease in margin from product sales driven by a less favorable product mix and increased component costs, (ii) a reduction in sales in the Healthcare division, which carries the highest gross margin of our three divisions, and (iii) an increase in sales in the Optoelectronics and Manufacturing division, which carries the lowest gross margin of our three divisions. ​ Operating Expenses ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Q2      % of      Q2 ​ % of ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      Fiscal 2022      Net Revenues      Fiscal 2023      Net Revenues      $ Change      % Change ​ Selling, general and administrative      $

Our significant selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses include employee compensation, sales commissions, travel, professional services, marketing expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense. SG&A expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $0.9 million lower than such expenses in the same prior-year period primarily due to reduced compensation costs offset primarily by a provision for bad debts compared to a bad debt recovery in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Research and development .
Research and development (R&D) expenses include research related to new product development and product enhancements. R&D expense during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $0.5 million lower than such expenses in the same prior-year period primarily due to a decrease in outside services incurred by our Security and Healthcare divisions partially offset by increases in compensation and professional fees. ​ Impairment, restructuring and other charges.
Impairment, restructuring and other charges generally consist of charges relating to reductions in our workforce, facilities consolidation, impairment of assets, costs related to acquisition activity, legal charges and other non-recurring charges. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, impairment, restructuring and other charges primarily consisted of $1.9 million for legal charges and $0.2 million in charges for employee terminations. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, impairment, restructuring and other charges primarily consisted of $0.5 million for legal charges and $0.3 million in charges for employee terminations. ​ 27
Table of Contents Interest and other expense, net .
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, interest and other expense, net was $5.2 million as compared to $2.2 million in the same prior-year period. This increase was driven by higher average interest rates and higher average levels of borrowing under our credit facility during the three months ended December 31, 2022 in comparison with the levels of borrowing during the same period in the prior year. The 1.25% convertible notes that were previously outstanding during the three month period ended December 31, 2021 were retired in September 2022 using borrowings from our credit facility which carries a higher interest rate. ​ Income taxes . The effective tax rate for a particular period varies depending on a number of factors, including (i) the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions, each of which applies a unique range of income tax rates and income tax credits, (ii) changes in previously established valuation allowances for deferred tax assets (changes are based upon our current analysis of the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be realized), (iii) the level of non-deductible expenses, (iv) certain tax elections, (v) tax holidays granted to certain of our international subsidiaries and (vi) discrete tax items. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a provision for income taxes of $4.0 million compared to $7.1 million for the comparable prior-year period. The effective tax rates for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 were 26.3% and 19.5%, respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a net discrete tax benefit of $0.4 million related to equity-based compensation under ASU 2016-09 and a benefit of $0.4 million from changes in prior year estimates. During the three-month periods ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a net discrete tax provision of $0.3 million for changes in prior year tax estimates and equity-based compensation under ASU 2016-09. ​ Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 (YTD Q2 Fiscal 2022) Compared to the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 (YTD Q2 Fiscal 2023) (amounts in millions) ​ Net Revenues The table below and the discussion that follows are based upon the way in which we analyze our business.

​ Interest and other expense, net .
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, interest and other expense, net was $8.6 million as compared to $4.2 million in the same prior-year period. This increase was driven by higher average interest rates and higher average levels of borrowing under our credit facility during the six months ended December 31, 2022 in comparison with the levels of borrowing during the same period in the prior year. The 1.25% convertible notes that were previously outstanding during the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 were retired in September 2022 using borrowings from our credit facility which carries a higher interest rate. ​ Income taxes . For the six months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a provision for income taxes of $7.6 million compared to $10.7 million for the comparable prior-year period. The effective tax rates for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 were 21.6% for both periods. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized discrete tax benefit of $0.5 million related to equity-based compensation under ASU 2016-09 and $0.4 million from changes in prior year estimates. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a net discrete tax benefit of $1.8 million, which was comprised of $2.0 million related to equity-based compensation under ASU 2016-09 partially offset by a discrete tax expense for prior year tax estimates of $0.2 million. ​ Liquidity and Capital Resources ​ Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and our credit facilities. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $45.6 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $18.6 million, or 29.0%, from $64.2 million at June 30, 2022. We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. In addition, we anticipate that cash generated from operations, without repatriating earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and our credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our obligations in the U.S. ​ We have a $750 million credit facility that is comprised of a $600 million revolving credit facility, which includes a $300 million sub-facility for letters of credit, and a $150 million term loan. As of December 31, 2022, there was $235.0 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility, $146.9 million outstanding under the term loan and $66.8 million of outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2022, the total amount available under these credit facilities was $298.2 million. ​ 29
Table of Contents Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities.
Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as net income, adjusted for non-cash items, and working capital fluctuations impact cash flows. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we generated cash from operations of $8.2 million compared to $3.4 million of cash generated in the same prior-year period. The increase was driven primarily by the positive impact in working capital changes. ​ Cash Used in Investing Activities . Net cash used in investing activities was $18.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $15.4 million in the same prior-year period. Cash used to acquire businesses was $3.5 million during the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 compared to nil in the prior year. Capital expenditures in the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 were $7.0 million compared to $7.4 million in the same prior-year period. Expenditures for intangible and other assets in the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 were $8.0 million compared to $8.1 million in the same prior-year period. ​ Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities . Net cash used in financing activities was $3.7 million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $17.6 million during the same prior-year period. The increase in cash used in financing activities was due to the increase in net payments on long-term debt by $145 million, of which $242.3 million pertains to the repurchase and cancellation of the 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes utilizing proceeds of the senior secured credit facility, that was partially offset by the increase in net borrowings on bank lines of credit by $93 million. Cash used to repurchase of common stock and taxes paid related to the net settlement of equity awards was $33.4 million in the six-months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $64.4 in the same prior-year period. Borrowings ​ See Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion regarding our credit facility and our Notes. ​ Cash Held by Foreign Subsidiaries ​ Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $45.6 million at December 31, 2022. Of this amount, approximately 98% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations. These foreign funds were held primarily by our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico, Canada and India and, to a lesser extent, in Indonesia, Albania and Australia. We intend to permanently reinvest certain earnings from foreign operations, and we currently do not anticipate that we will need this cash in foreign countries to fund our U.S. operations. In the event we repatriate cash from certain foreign operations and if taxes have not previously been withheld on the related earnings, we would provide for withholding taxes at the time we change our intention with regard to the reinvestment of those earnings. ​ Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities ​ The following table contains information about the shares of common stock we purchased during the quarter ended December 31, 2022: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Maximum number (or ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ approximate dollar ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ value) of ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total number of ​ shares (or ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ shares (or units) ​ units) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ purchased as ​ that may ​ ​ Total number of ​ Average price ​ part of publicly ​ yet be purchased ​ ​ shares (or units) ​ paid per share (or ​ announced plans or ​ under the plans or ​      purchased       unit)      programs      programs (1) October 1 to October 31, 2022
