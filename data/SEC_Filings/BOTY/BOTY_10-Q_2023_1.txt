6 Table of Contents   LINGERIE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIPS, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2022   NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS   Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Nevada corporation incorporated on November 29, 2006 under the name Sparking Events, Inc. The Company’s corporate name was changed to Xodtec Group USA, Inc. in June 2009, Xodtec LED, Inc. in May 2010, Cala Energy Corp. in September 2013 and Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc. on April 1, 2015.   The Company focuses on developing, producing, promoting, and distributing entertainment through live entertainment events, digital home videos, broadcast television networks, video on demand, and digital media channels in the United States. It offers wrestling and mixed martial arts fights featuring women under the LFC brand name.   NOTE 2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES   The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2022. Notes to the unaudited interim financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for fiscal year 2021 have been omitted. These interim financial statements are condensed and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the footnotes thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2022.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company continually evaluates its estimates and judgments. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even for estimates and judgments that are not deemed critical.   Reclassifications   Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had $ 12,586
and $ 34,481
in cash and cash equivalents as at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.   Revenue Recognition   The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products and services in accordance with ASC 606,“ Revenue Recognition ” following the five steps procedure:   Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with customers Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract   Step 3: Determine the transaction price Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations Step 5: Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation   The Company’s revenue derives from the development, promotion and distribution of live events and televised entertainment programming and also through sponsorship and site subscription. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $78,831 and $ 76,339
and incurred cost of sales of $ 24,657
and $ 66,660 , resulting in gross profit and of $ 54,174
and $ 9,679 , respectively.     7 Table of Contents   Earnings (Loss) per Share   The Company computes basic and diluted net loss per share amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share.” Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if convertible notes to issue common stock were converted resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the loss of the Company.   For the nine months and three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, convertible notes and warrants were dilutive instruments and were included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.       September 30,     September 30,       2022     2021       (Shares)     (Shares)   Convertible notes payable     2,063,454,285       449,841,893   Warrants     4,222,666,666       5,212,083,333         6,286,120,951       5,661,925,226     Related Party Balances and Transactions   The Company follows FASB ASC 850, “ Related Party Disclosures ,” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transaction. (See Note 9)   Convertible Instruments and Derivatives   The Company evaluates and account for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging Activities.”   Share-Based Compensation   The Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Employee awards are accounted for under ASC 718 - where the awards are valued at grant date. Awards given to nonemployees are accounted for under ASC 505 where the awards are valued at earlier of commitment date or completion of services. Compensation cost for employee awards is recognized over the vesting or requisite service period. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of options or warrants granted.   Fair Value Measurement   The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements.   The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amounts of our short and long term credit obligations approximate fair value because the effective yields on these obligations, which include contractual interest rates taken together with other features such as concurrent issuances of warrants and/or embedded conversion options, are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk.     8 Table of Contents   ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:   Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 – quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable Level 3 – inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)   The derivative liability in connection with the conversion feature of the convertible debt, classified as a level 3 liability, is the only financial liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis. (See Note 8)   The following table summarizes fair value measurement by level at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, measured at fair value on a recurring basis:   September
30, 2022   Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     Total   Assets                         None     -       -       -       -   Liabilities                                 Derivative liabilities     -       -       3,887,597       3,887,597     December 31, 2021   Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     Total   Assets                         None     -       -       -       -   Liabilities                                 Derivative liabilities     -       -       5,323,107       5,323,107     Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 “ Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options ”. The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and, (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For the Company, the new standard was effective on January 1, 2021 and the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements.   In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance will be effective for entities for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. For the Company, the new standard was effective on January 1, 2021 and the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements.   Management has considered all other recent accounting pronouncements issued. The Company’s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
9 Table of Contents   NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has generated nominal revenues since inception, has sustained losses since its organization and requires funding to generate revenue. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.   Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company can give no assurances that it can or will become financially viable and continue as a going concern.   NOTE 4 – STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT   Preferred Stock   The authorized preferred stock consists of
10,000,000
shares with a par value $ 0.001
per share. The board of directors has broad discretion in setting the rights, preferences and privileges of one or more series of preferred stock.   On September 3, 2016, the Company issued
51
Series A preferred shares to the Chief Executive Officer. The Series A preferred shares have voting rights, resulting in the Series A stockholder holding in aggregate approximately
51 % of the total voting power of all issued and outstanding voting capital of the Company. The valuation of the preferred shares was completed by the Company based on the change in voting percentage rights before and after the Series A shares were issued. The value of the Series A shares is $ 42,669
and was expensed.   There were
51
and
51
preferred shares issued and outstanding as at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.   Common Stock   The Company has authorized

We seek to promote and market our brand, our programming, our events and our products.   Our mission is to establish the popularity of our LFC league and brand based on holding live events and to promote our athletes via a reality series and merchandise such a t-shirts and calendars. Our uniqueness is derived from our predominantly all female league structure, where a vast array of beautiful, attractive and unique women engage in wrestling and MMA fighting techniques against one another for purposes of delivering high quality entertainment to mature audiences.   Our management believes that the LFC league and our unique approach in applying a predominantly all female league structure to wrestling and mixed martial arts gives us a substantial competitive advantage to build the popularity of the LFC league in general.

In July 2021, we were approached by a company called Scuffle LLC who specialize in launching Roku channels. We have partnered with them to launch our own channel we’ll be calling “LFC Network”. The channel will carry our past events, our reality series and several new series we plan to create. It will be similar in scope to WWE Network. It will be funded by a combination of subscription fees, advertisers and sponsors, both self generated and placed by Roku itself.   On August 27, 2021, we announced LFC35: Booty Camp 3D which would take place Halloween in Las Vegas and would be shot using 360 degree virtual reality cameras.   On September 1, 2021, we announced the launch of LFC Madness 2, a follow-up to our first LFC Madness bracket style virtual tournament. Once again the two prospects with the most votes would fight each other at LFC35 and each would receive a $1200 diamond bracelet courtesy Boston Diamonds & Bling.   On October 1, 2021, LFC Network was launched on schedule on Roku.   On October 19, 2021, we launched our own branded CBD pain relief cream called ‘LFC True Relief’.

At September 30, 2022 we had a working capital deficiency of $5,725,779 and an accumulated deficit of $10,648,112. The Company intends to fund future operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending December 31, 2022.   The ability of the Company to realize its business plan is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings.   These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.   The following table sets forth certain information about our cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:       Nine Months Ended                    September 30,
