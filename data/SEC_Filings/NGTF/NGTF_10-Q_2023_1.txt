Company’s fiscal year end is June 30.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Management
is responsible for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP).
Interim
Financial Statements
These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, reflect
all adjustments including normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.
These
interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively, which are included in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on
September 28, 2022. The Company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read, or have access to, the
audited consolidated financial statements for the preceding period, and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair
presentation may be determined in that context. The results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not
necessarily indicative of results for the entire year ending June 30, 2023.
Use
of Estimates
● The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. Estimates are used in the determination of depreciation and amortization, the valuation for non-cash issuances
of common stock, and the website, income taxes and contingencies, valuing convertible preferred stock for a “beneficial conversion
feature” (“BCF”) and warrants among others.
7
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
● The
Company classifies as cash and cash equivalents amounts on deposit in the banks and cash temporarily in various instruments with original
maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents on deposit with financial
institutions in the United States. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) covers $ 250,000  for substantially
all depository accounts. The Company from time to time may have amounts on deposit in excess of the insured limits.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
● Statement
of financial accounting standard FASB Topic 820, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires that the Company disclose
estimated fair values of financial instruments. The carrying amounts reported in the statements of financial position for assets and
liabilities qualifying as financial instruments are a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Inventories
● Inventories
consisting of packaged food items and supplies are stated at the lower of cost (FIFO) or net realizable value, including provisions for
spoilage commensurate with known or estimated exposures which are recorded as a charge to cost of sales during the period spoilage is
incurred. The Company has no minimum purchase commitments with its vendors.
Advertising
Costs
● Advertising
costs are expensed when incurred and are included in advertising and promotional expense in the accompanying statements of operations.
Although not traditionally thought of by many as “advertising costs”, the Company includes expenses related to graphic design
work, package design, website design, domain names, and product samples in the category of “advertising costs”. The Company
recorded advertising costs of $ 53,169
and $ 158,040  for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company
recorded advertising costs of $  90,335  and $ 465,791  for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Income
Taxes
● The
Company has not generated any taxable income, and, therefore, no provision for income taxes has been provided. Deferred income taxes
are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and those reported for income
tax purposes in accordance with FASB Topic 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes”, which requires the use of the asset/liability
method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and
for tax loss and credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company provides for deferred
taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards when realization is more likely than
not.
● A
valuation allowance has been recorded to fully offset the deferred tax asset even though the Company believes it is more likely than
not that the assets will be utilized
● The
Company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rates associated with taxing jurisdictions because of permanent and temporary
timing differences as well as a valuation allowance.
8
Revenue
Recognition
● The
Company generates its revenue by selling its nighttime snack products wholesale to retailers and wholesalers. All sources of revenue
are recorded pursuant to FASB Topic 606 Revenue Recognition, to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This includes
a five-step framework that requires an entity to: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations
in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract,
and (v) recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In addition, this revenue generation requires disclosure
of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
● The
Company revenue from contracts with customers provides that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services.
● The
Company incurs costs associated with product distribution, such as freight and handling costs. The Company has elected to treat these
costs as fulfillment activities and recognizes these costs at the same time that it recognizes the underlying product revenue. As this
policy election is in line with the Company’s previous accounting practices, the treatment of shipping and handling activities
under FASB Topic 606 did not have any impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement
disclosures.
● The
adoption of ASC 606 did not result in a change to the accounting for any of the Company’s revenue streams that are within the scope
of the amendments. The Company’s services that fall within the scope of ASC 606 are recognized as revenue as the Company satisfies
its obligation to the customer.
● In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which updates revenue recognition guidance relating to
contracts with customers. This standard states that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
This standard is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after July 1, 2018. The Company adopted
ASU 2014-09 and its related amendments (collectively known as “ASC 606”) during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the
full retrospective method.
● Management
reviewed ASC 606-10-32-25 which states  “Consideration payable to a customer includes cash amounts that an entity pays,
or expects to pay, to the customer (or to other parties that purchase the entity’s goods or services from the customer). Consideration
payable to a customer also includes credit or other items (for example, a coupon or voucher) that can be applied against amounts owed
to the entity (or to other parties that purchase the entity’s goods or services from the customer). An entity shall account for
consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of the transaction price and, therefore, of revenue unless the payment to the customer
is in exchange for a distinct good or service (as described in paragraphs 606-10-25-18 through 25-22) that the customer transfers to
the entity. If the consideration payable to a customer includes a variable amount, an entity shall estimate the transaction price (including
assessing whether the estimate of variable consideration is constrained) in accordance with paragraphs 606-10-32-5 through 32-13.”
● If
the consideration payable to a customer is a payment for a distinct good service, then in accordance with ASC 606-10-32-26, the entity
should account for it the same way that it accounts for other purchases from suppliers (expense). Further,  “if the amount
of consideration payable to the customer exceeds the fair value of the distinct good or service that the entity receives from the customer,
then the entity shall account for such an excess as a reduction of the transaction price. If the entity cannot reasonably estimate the
fair value of the good or service received from the customer, it shall account for all of the consideration payable to the customer as
a reduction of the transaction price.”
9
● Under
ASC 606-10-32-27, if the consideration payable to a customer is accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price,  “an
entity shall recognize the reduction of revenue when (or as) the later of either of the following events occurs:
a)
The entity
recognizes revenue for the transfer of the related goods or services to the customer.
b)
The entity pays or promises
to pay the consideration (even if the payment is conditional on a future event). That promise might be implied by the entity’s
customary business practices.”
● Management
reviewed each arrangement to determine if each fee paid is for a distinct good or service and should be expensed as incurred or if the
Company should recognize the payment as a reduction of revenue.
● The
Company recognizes revenue upon shipment based on meeting the transfer of control criteria. The Company has made a policy election to
treat shipping and handling as costs to fulfill the contract, and as a result, any fees received from customers are included in the transaction
price allocated to the performance obligation of providing goods with a corresponding amount accrued within cost of sales for amounts
paid to applicable carriers.
Concentration
of Credit Risk
● Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits at financial institutions.
At various times during the year, the Company may exceed the federally insured limits. To mitigate this risk, the Company places its
cash deposits only with high credit quality institutions. Management believes the risk of loss is minimal. At December 31, 2022 and June
30, 2022, the Company did not have any uninsured cash deposits.
Beneficial
Conversion Feature
● For
conventional convertible debt where the rate of conversion is below market value, the Company records any BCF intrinsic value as additional
paid in capital and related debt discount.
● When
the Company records a BCF, the relative fair value of the BCF is recorded as a debt discount against the face amount of the respective
debt instrument. The discount is amortized over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate
share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.
Beneficial
Conversion Feature – Series B Preferred Stock (deemed dividend):
Each share
of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.001  per share (the “B Preferred” or “B Preferred
Stock”) has a liquidation preference of $ 1,000  and has no voting rights except as to matters pertaining to the rights and privileges
of the B Preferred.  Each share of B Preferred is convertible at the option of the holder thereof into (i) 5,000 shares of the Registrant’s
common stock (one share for each $0.20 of liquidation preference) (the “Conversion Shares”) and (ii) 5,000 common stock purchase
warrants, expiring April 16, 2026 (the “Warrants”). The Warrants carried an initial exercise price of $0.30 per share. Subsequent
financing events resulted in adjustments to the exercise price of all warrants created from conversion of B Preferred from $0.30 per share
to approximately $0.07474 per share through December 31, 2022.
The exercise price of these warrants can continue to adjust as the result
of subsequent financing events and stock transactions. These adjustments can result in an exercise price that is either higher, or lower,
than the price as of December 31, 2022.
Based
on the guidance in ASC 470-20-20, the Company determined that a BCF existed, as the effective conversion price for the B Preferred at
issuance was less than the fair value of the common stock which the shares of B Preferred are convertible into. A BCF feature based on
the intrinsic value of the date of issuances for the B Preferred was approximately $4.4 million.
10
Debt
Issue Costs
● The
Company may pay debt issue costs in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt whether convertible or not or with other
consideration. These costs are recorded as debt discounts and are amortized over the life of the debt to the statement of operations.
Equity
Issuance Costs
● The
Company accounts for costs related to the issuance of equity as a charge to Paid in Capital and records the equity transaction net of
issuance costs.
Original
Issue Discount
● If
debt is issued with an original issue discount, the original issue discount is recorded to debt discount, reducing the face amount of
the note and is amortized over the life of the debt to the statement of operations as interest expense. If a conversion of the underlying
debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.
Stock
Settled Debt
● In
certain instances, the Company will issue convertible notes which contain a provision in which the price of the conversion feature is
priced at a fixed discount to the trading price of the Company’s common shares as traded in the over-the-counter market.  In
these instances, the Company records a liability, in addition to the principal amount of the convertible note, as stock-settled debt
for the fixed value transferred to the convertible note holder from the fixed discount conversion feature.
Stock-Based
Compensation
● The
Company accounts for share-based awards issued to employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718. Accordingly, employee share-based payment
compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite
service period.  Additionally, share-based awards to non-employees are expensed over the period in which the related services
are rendered at their fair value. The Company applies ASC 718, “Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees”, with respect to
options and warrants issued to non-employees.
Customer
Concentration
● During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had one customer account for approximately 35% of the gross sales, one customer accounted
for approximately 26% of gross sales, and one customer accounted for approximately 12% and another customer accounted for approximately
10% of gross sales. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company had one customer account for 26% of the gross sales. One
other customer accounted for 18% of the gross sales and two other customers each account for more than 10% of the gross sales. During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had one customer account for approximately 74% of the gross sales. One other customer
accounted for approximately 23% of gross sales. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company had one customer account
for 36% of the gross sales. One other customer accounted for 22% of the gross sales.
11
Vendor
Concentration
● During
the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, two vendors accounted for more than
10 % of the Company’s operating expenses. During
the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, two vendors accounted for more than
10 % of the Company’s operating expenses During
the three and six-month periods ended December 31, 2021, no vendors accounted for more than
10 % of the Company’s operating expenses.
Receivables
Concentration
● As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had receivables due from eleven customers.  One accounted for 57% of the total balance, one
accounted for 21% of the total balance and one accounted for 8% of the total balance.
As of June 30, 2022, the Company had receivables
due from six customers, one of which accounted for over 59% of the outstanding balance. One of the remaining five accounted for 13.5%
of the outstanding balance and one accounted for 11% of the outstanding balance.
Income/Loss
Per Share
● In
accordance with ASC Topic 260 – Earnings Per Share, the basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding. Diluted loss per common share is computed similar
to basic loss per common share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that
would have been outstanding if the potential common stock had been issued and if the additional shares of common stock were dilutive.  Potential
common stock consists of the incremental common stock issuable upon convertible notes, stock options and warrants, and classes of shares
with conversion features. The computation of basic loss per share for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 excludes
potentially dilutive securities because their inclusion would be antidilutive. As a result, the computations of net loss per share for
each period presented is the same for both basic and fully diluted losses per share.
Reclassification
● The
Company may make certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform with the current year’s presentation.  Such
reclassifications would not have a material effect on its consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
● ASU
No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes
● In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The ASU is intended to enhance and simplify
aspects of the income tax accounting guidance in ASC 740 as part of the FASB’s simplification initiative. This guidance is effective
for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption permitted. The Company
has adopted this ASU and there is no material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
12
● In
March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04,  Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) :  Facilitation of the Effects of Reference
Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.  This guidance provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance
on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from the London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight
Financing Rate. This ASU is applied prospectively and becomes effective immediately upon the transition from LIBOR. The Company has analyzed
the guidance and the Company has no contract or hedging relationships that will be affected by this guidance. The adoption of this guidance
will have no impact on its consolidated financial statements.
● In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 to simplify the current guidance for convertible instruments and the derivatives scope exception
for contracts in an entity’s own equity. Additionally, the amendments affect the diluted EPS calculation for instruments that may
be settled in cash or shares and for convertible instruments. The update also provides for expanded disclosure requirements to increase
transparency. For SEC filers, excluding smaller reporting companies, this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2022 including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance does not materially impact our financial
statements and related disclosures.
● The
Company will continue to monitor these emerging issues to assess any potential future impact on its financial statements.
3.
Going Concern
● The
Company’s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate the realization of
assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Because the business is new and has limited operating history
and relatively few sales, no certainty of continuation can be stated.
●
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had an operating and net loss of $ 5,761,372
and cash flow used in operations of $ 738,165
and an accumulated deficit of $ 37,548,495 .
●
The
Company has limited available cash resources and it does not believe its cash on hand will be adequate to satisfy our ongoing working
capital and growth needs throughout Fiscal Year 2023.
The
Company is continuing to seek to raise capital through the sales of its common stock, including pursuant to its recently launched
Tier 2 offering pursuant to Regulation A (also known as “Regulation A+”) of units consisting of common stock and warrants,
preferred stock and/or convertible notes, as well as potentially the exercise of outstanding warrants, to finance the Company’s
operations, of which it can give no assurance of success. Management has devoted a significant amount of time in the raising of capital
from additional debt and equity financing. However, the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
raising additional funds through debt and equity financing and generating revenue. The Company believes that its current capitalization
structure, combined with ongoing increases in revenues, will enable it to successfully secure required financing to continue its
growth.
●
Because the
Company has limited sales, no certainty of continuation can be stated. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon raising additional funds through debt and equity financing and generating revenue. In addition, the Company will
receive the proceeds from its outstanding warrants as, if and when such warrants are exercised for cash. There are no assurances
the Company will receive the necessary funding or generate revenue necessary to fund operations.
13
●
Even if the
Company is successful in raising additional funds, the Company cannot give any assurance that it will, in the future, be able to
achieve a level of profitability from the sale of its products to sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
●
The outbreak
of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), including the measures to reduce its spread, and the impact on the economy, cannot fully be
understood and identified. Indications to date are that there are somewhat offsetting factors relating to the impact on our Company.
Industry data shows that supermarket sales remain up, with more people spending more time at home. Anecdotally and statistically,
snacking activity is also up while consumers are reporting a decrease in sleep quality and sleep satisfaction.
●
The offsetting
factors are the impact of the virus on the overall economy, and the impact that a down economic period can have on consumer behavior,
including potential reductions in travel, hotel occupancy, and trial of new brands. Greater unemployment, recession, and other possible
unforeseen factors are shown to have an impact. Research indicates that consumers are less likely to try new brands during economic
recession and stress, returning to the legacy brands they’ve known for decades.
●
From both public
statements observed, and conversations conducted between Nightfood Management and current and former executives from certain global
food and beverage conglomerates, it has been affirmed to Management that there is increased strategic interest in the nighttime nutrition
space as a potential high-growth opportunity, partially due to recent declines in consumer sleep quality and increases in at-home
nighttime snacking.
●
We have experienced
no major issues with supply chain or logistics. Order processing function has been normal to date, and our manufacturers have assured
us that their operations are “business as usual” as of the time of this filing.
●
It is possible
that the fallout from the pandemic could make it more difficult in the future for the Company to access required growth capital,
possibly rendering us unable to meet certain debts and expenses.
●
It is impossible
to know what the future holds with regard to the virus, both for our company and in the broader sense. There are many uncertainties
regarding the current coronavirus pandemic, and the Company is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of its
business, including how it will impact its customers, vendors, and business partners. It is difficult to know if the pandemic has
materially impacted the results of operations, and we are unable to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our financial position
and operating results due to numerous uncertainties. The Company expects to continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19
pandemic and intends to make adjustments accordingly, if necessary.
4.
Accounts receivable
●
The Company’s
accounts receivable arises primarily from the sale of the Company’s ice cream. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates each
customer account and based on the days outstanding of the receivable, history of past write-offs, collections, and current credit
conditions, writes off accounts it considers uncollectible. With most of our retail and distribution partners, invoices will typically
be due in 30 days. The Company does not accrue interest on past due accounts and the Company does not require collateral. Accounts
become past due on an account-by-account basis. Determination that an account is uncollectible is made after all reasonable collection
efforts have been exhausted. The Company has not provided any accounts receivable allowances for December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022,
respectively.

Debt
●
Convertible
Notes Payable consist of the following at December 31, 2022.
Convertible
Notes Issued on December 10, 2021
On
December 10, 2021, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with certain
accredited and institutional investors (the “Purchasers”) for the purchase and sale of an aggregate of: (i)$ 1,086,956.52  in
principal amount of Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Notes (the “Notes”) for $ 1,000,000  (representing
a  8 % original issue discount) (“Purchase Price”) and (ii) warrants to purchase up to  4,000,000  shares of the
Company’s common stock (the “Warrants”) in a private placement (the “Offering”). Each Note featured an  8 %
original issue discount, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $ 500,000  for each of the two Notes. The Notes have a maturity
of  December 10, 2022 , an interest rate of  8 % per annum, and are initially convertible at a fixed price of $ 0.25  per share,
with provisions for conversions at a fixed price of $ 0.20  per share should the closing trading price of our common stock be below
$ 0.20  per share after June 10, 2022. The conversion price is also subject to further price adjustments in the event of (i) stock
splits and dividends, (ii) subsequent rights offerings, (iii) pro-rata distributions, and (iv) certain fundamental transactions, including
but not limited to the sale of the Company, business combinations, and reorganizations (v)
in
the event that the Company issues or sells any additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents at a price per share less
than the Exercise Price then in effect or without consideration then the Exercise Price upon each such issuance shall be reduced to the
Dilutive Issuance Price,
which resulted in an adjustment of the conversion price to $ 0.0333 . These
Notes, for as long as they are outstanding, are secured by all assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, senior secured guarantees
of the subsidiaries of the Company, and pledges of the common stock of all the subsidiaries of the Company. The Notes have provisions
allowing for repayment at any time at  115 % of the outstanding principal and interest within the first three months, and  120 %
of the outstanding principal and interest at any time thereafter.
The
Warrants are initially exercisable at $ 0.25  per share and, are subject to cashless exercise after six months if the shares
underlying the Warrants are not subject to an effective resale registration statement. The Warrants are also subject to customary adjustments,
including price protections.
In
connection with Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company issued to the Placement Agent (as defined below), an aggregate of  878,260  Common
Stock purchase warrants (“PA Warrants”). The PA Warrants are substantially similar to the Warrants. The fair value of the
PA Warrants at issuance was estimated to be $ 170,210  based on a risk-free interest rate of  1.25 %, an expected term of  5  years,
an expected volatility of  142.53 % and a  0 % dividend yield.
Spencer
Clarke Holdings LLC (“Placement Agent”) acted as the placement agent, in connection with the sale of the securities pursuant
to the Securities Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to an engagement agreement entered into by and between the Company and the Placement Agent,
the Company agreed to pay the Placement Agent a cash commission of $ 100,000 . Pursuant to the discussion above, the Company also issued
an aggregate of  878,260  PA Warrants to the Placement Agent.
The
gross proceeds received from the Offering were approximately $ 1,000,000 . The cash Placement Agent fees of $ 100,000  was paid separately.
Also, the Company reimbursed the lead Purchaser $ 15,192  for legal fees, which was deducted from the required subscription amount
to be paid.
Pursuant
to the terms of Note, among other things, the Company was required to pay to the Purchasers on December 10, 2022, as extended to December
29, 2022 (as so extended, the “Maturity Date”) all remaining principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Maturity Date
(the “Owed Amount”) and the failure to so pay the Owed Amount on the Maturity Date is an event of default. The Owed Amount
was not paid by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Notes. Subsequent to the December 31, 2022 the Company entered into a
forbearance agreement with the Purchasers as disclosed on Form 8K filed on February 8, 2023.
The
Company evaluated all of the associated financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging. Based on this evaluation,
the Company has determined that no provisions required derivative accounting.
In
accordance with ASC 470- Debt, the Company first allocated the cash proceeds to the loan and the warrants on a relative fair value basis,
secondly, the proceeds were allocated to the beneficial conversion feature.

Promissory
Notes Issued on September 23, 2022
On
September 23, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement and issued and sold to an institutional investor, a Promissory
Note (the “Promissory Note”) in the principal sum of $700,000.00, which amount is the $644,000 actual amount of the purchase
price plus an original issue discount in the amount of $56,000. In connection with the issuance of the Promissory Note, the Company issued
to the investor warrants to purchase 2,800,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.225, as well as returnable warrants
(the “Returnable Warrants”), which may only be exercised in the event that the Company were to default on certain debt obligations,
to purchase 7,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.30, in each case subject to adjustment. The Promissory Note may
be converted into Company common stock in the event of an event of default under the Promissory Note by the Company.
As
a result of the transaction, the Purchasers triggered their “most favored nation” clause which resulted in the Company entering
into an MFN Amendment Agreement (the “MFN Agreement”) with the Purchasers, pursuant to which the Purchasers exercised their
options under the most-favored nation terms contained in their existing transaction documents with the Company. Pursuant to the MFN Agreement,
among other things, (a) the Company issued to each of the Purchasers  5,434,783   5 -year Returnable Warrants which may only be
exercised in the event that the Company were to default on certain debt obligations at an initial Exercise Price per share of $ 0.30 ,
(b) the events of default set forth in the Notes were amended to include certain of the Events of Default reflected in the Promissory
Note, (c) the conversion price of the Notes was amended so that upon an event of default, the conversion price equaled $ 0.10 , and further
down to $ 0.0333
subject to adjustment, (d) the Purchasers are entitled to deduct $ 1,750  from conversions to cover associated fees,
and $ 750.00  shall be added to each prepayment to reimburse the Purchasers for administrative fees and (e) the definition of Exempt
Issuance in the note was modified to remove certain clauses of the definition.
17
As
a result of the financing, the Company is required to pay cash fees to its bankers (including the Placement Agent), which amounts are
being determined but will not be less than $67,000, and to issue compensatory warrants to the Placement Agents to purchase 280,000 shares
of common stock at an exercise price of $0.225, warrants to purchase 119,260 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.27, in
each case subject to adjustment.
The
proceeds received by the Company from the Offering, net of the original issue discount, fees and costs including legal fees of $ 7,000  and
commission fees of $ 32,200  were $ 604,800 . Subsequently, the Company also paid cash Placement Agent fees of $ 35,000 .
The
Company evaluated all of the associated financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging. Based on this evaluation,
the Company has determined that no provisions required derivative accounting.
The
Company first allocated the cash proceeds to the warrants, secondly, the proceeds were allocated to the present value of principal.

Capital Stock Activity
On
October 16, 2013, Nightfood, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nightfood Holdings, Inc. Accordingly, the stockholders’ equity
has been revised to reflect the share exchange on a retroactive basis.
Common
Stock
The
Company is authorized to issue Two Hundred Million ( 200,000,000 ) shares of $ 0.001  par value per share Common Stock. Holders of Common
Stock are each entitled to cast one vote for each Share held of record on all matters presented to shareholders. Cumulative voting is
not allowed; hence, the holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Stock can elect all directors, subject to the rights of the holder
of Series A Stock described below. Holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by the Board of
Directors out of funds legally available therefore and, in the event of liquidation, to share pro-rata in any distribution of the Company’s
assets after payment of liabilities. The Board of Directors is not obligated to declare a dividend and it is not anticipated that dividends
will be paid unless and until the Company is profitable. Holders of Common Stock do not have pre-emptive rights to subscribe to additional
shares if issued by the Company. There are no conversion, redemption, sinking fund or similar provisions regarding the Common Stock.
All of the outstanding Shares of Common Stock are fully paid and non-assessable and all of the Shares of Common Stock offered thereby
will be, upon issuance, fully paid and non-assessable. Holders of Shares of Common Stock will have full rights to vote on all matters
brought before shareholders for their approval, subject to preferential rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock. Holders of
the Common Stock will be entitled to receive dividends, if and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available,
and share pro-rata in any distributions to holders of Common Stock upon liquidation. The holders of Common Stock will have no conversion,
pre-emptive or other subscription rights. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, assets, after the payment of
debts and liabilities and any liquidation preferences of, and unpaid dividends on, any class of preferred stock then outstanding, will
be distributed pro-rata to the holders of the common stock. The holders of the common stock have no right to require the Company to redeem
or purchase their shares. Holders of shares of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more
than  50 % of the outstanding shares, voting for the election of directors, can elect all of the directors to be elected, if they
so choose, and, in that event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any of our directors.

Preferred
Stock
Series
A Preferred Stock
The
Company is authorized to issue  1,000,000  shares of $ 0.001  par value per share Preferred Stock.  Of the 1,000,000 shares,
10,000 shares were designated as Series A Preferred Stock (“Series A Stock”). Holders of Series A Stock are each entitled
to cast 100,000 votes for each Share held of record on all matters presented to shareholders.
In
addition to his ownership of the common stock, Mr. Folkson owns 1,000 shares of the Series A Stock which votes with the common stock
and has an aggregate of 100,000,000 votes.
The Company
had  1,000  and  1,000  shares of the Series A Stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022,
respectively.
19
Series
B Preferred Stock
In
April 2021, the Company designated 5,000 shares of its Preferred Stock as B Preferred, each share of which is convertible
into 5,000 shares of common stock and 5,000 non-detachable warrants with a strike price of $0.30.
During
the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company sold  335  and  4,665  shares of its B Preferred for gross
cash proceeds of $ 335,000  and $ 3,150,000 , respectively.  These proceeds were used for operating capital. The B Preferred meets
the criteria for equity classification and is accounted for as equity transactions. Specifically, among other factors, this qualifies
as equity because redemption is not invoked at the option of the holder and the B Preferred does not have to be redeemed on a specified
date.
During
the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, holders of the B Preferred converted  1,740  shares of B Preferred into  8,700,000  shares
of its common stock.
During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, holders of the B Preferred Stock converted  960  shares of B Preferred Stock into  4,800,000  shares
of its common stock
The Company
had  2,300  and  3,260  shares of its B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022,
respectively.
Dividends
The
Company has never declared dividends, however as set out below, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, upon issuance of
a total of 335 and 4,665 shares of B Preferred, respectively, the Company recorded a deemed dividend as a result
of beneficial conversion feature associated with the transaction.
In
connection with certain conversion terms provided for in the designation of the B Preferred, pursuant to which each share of B Preferred
is convertible into  5,000  shares of common stock and  5,000  warrants, the Company recognized a beneficial conversion
feature upon the conclusion of the transaction in the amount of $ 4,431,387 .  The beneficial conversion feature was treated
as a deemed dividend, and fully amortized on the transaction date due to the fact that the issuance of the B Preferred was classified
as equity.
10.
Warrants
The
following is a summary of the Company’s outstanding common stock purchase warrants.
During
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, holders of the Company’s B Preferred converted  1,740  shares of B Preferred into  8,700,000  shares

20
During
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement For Shareholder Lock-Up And Acquisition of Warrants (the “Lock-Up
Agreement”), with Mr. Folkson, issuing warrants at a strike price of $ 0.30  having a term of  one year . The Company valued

During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, holders of the Company’s B Preferred converted  960  shares of B Preferred into  4,800,00  shares
of its common stock, along with  4,800,000  warrants issued to those holders with an adjusted exercise price of $ 0.0747  as
of December 31, 2022. Said warrants are subject to further exercise price adjustments resulting from certain financing activities and
equity transactions which could increase or decrease the exercise price in in the future.
During
the three months ended September 30, 2022, 2,800,000 warrants were issued to the holder of an outstanding promissory note with an
initial exercise price of $0.225 per share, 280,000 warrants were concurrently issued to the Placement Agent with an initial exercise
price of $0.225, and a further 119,260 warrants were issued to the Placement Agent with initial exercise price of $0.27 per share. The
Company valued these warrants using the Black Scholes model utilizing a 122.42% volatility and a risk-free rate of 3.91%.
On October 4, 2022, the Company and the Placement Agent
entered into an Addendum to amend their Letter of Engagement wto cancel compensatory warrants to purchase 280,000 shares of common stock
of the Company, to cancel returnable compensatory warrants to purchase 700,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company for a one time cash
payment of $35,000 and the issuance of 500,000 shares of Common Stock in full satisfaction of compensation earned.
During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company
issued
an aggregate of  586,111  shares of its common stock for the cashless exercise of
750,000
stock purchase warrants.
During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into a warrant agreement with one of the Company’s Directors for the
issuance of
100,000  warrants at a strike price of $ 0.125  having a term of  five years . The Company valued these warrants
using the Black Scholes model utilizing a  121.75 % volatility and a risk-free rate of  4.06 %.
During
the six months ended December 31, 2022 the Company issued 1,829,400 warrants to various subscribers under its
Tier
2 offering pursuant to Regulation A (also known as “Regulation A+”) whereunder the Company is offering
up to 5,000,000
units at a price of $0.50 per unit, each unit consisting of 4 shares of common stock and 4 common stock purchase warrants (“Unit”)
for exercise at at a strike price per Share equal to 125% of the price per share of common stock, or $0.15625 per share with a term of
2 years.
The Company valued these warrants using the Black Scholes model on each closing date utilizing
a volatility between 106.15% and 111.39% and a risk-free rate ranging from 4.21% and 4.61%%.
Certain
warrants in the below table include dilution protection for the warrant holders, which could cause the exercise price to be adjusted either
higher or lower as a result of various financing events and stock transactions. For example, as a result of the December 2021
Offering, which would allow the new noteholders to convert their debt to shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.20/share, some
of the $0.30 warrants outstanding in the table below had their exercise price reduced from $0.30 to $0.2919 which was further adjusted
to $0.0747 prior to December 31, 2022 upon the occurrence of a further dilutive event. The result of the warrant exercise price downward
adjustment on modification date was treated as a deemed dividend and fully amortized on the transaction date, and the Company recorded
$3,685,665 to additional paid in capital and retained earnings on the Company’s balance sheets. In addition to the reduction
in exercise price, there is a corresponding increase to the number of warrants to the holder on a prorated basis. Under certain conditions,
such as the successful retirement of a convertible note through repayment, it is possible for the exercise price of these warrants to
increase and for the number of warrants outstanding to decrease.
21
The
aggregate intrinsic value of the warrants as of December 31, 2022 is $ 2,590,862 . The aggregate intrinsic value of the warrants as of
June 30, 2022 was $ 11,650 .

Returnable
Warrants
A
cumulative total of  18,956,523  Returnable Warrants issued in conjunction with a financing agreement dated as of September
23, 2022, and a MFN agreement entered into concurrently on
September 23, 2022
(ref: Note 8 above) may only be exercised in the event
that the Company were to default on certain debt obligations. The Returnable Warrants have an initial exercise price of $ 0.30  per
share, subject to customary adjustments (including price-based anti-dilution adjustments) and may be exercised at any time after an Event
of Default until the five-year anniversary of such date. The Returnable Warrants include a cashless exercise provision as set forth therein.
The exercise of the Returnable Warrants are subject to a beneficial ownership limitation of  4.99 % of the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. In the event of the Company’s failure to timely deliver shares
of Common Stock upon exercise of the Returnable Warrants, the Company would be obligated to pay a “Buy-In” amount pursuant
to the terms of the Returnable Warrants.
During
the three months ended September 30, 2022,  7,000,000  returnable warrants issued to the holder of a certain Promissory
Note dated  September 23, 2022 , were initially valued using the Black Scholes model with a volatility of  121.88 % and a risk-free
rate of  3.91 % resulting in contingent expenses to be recorded as additional financing costs in the cumulative amount of $ 642,140 ,
which amount will be recorded in a future reporting period, only in the event the Company defaults on certain debt obligations.
On December
29, 2022, upon an event of default as defined under the MFN agreement,
5,434,785  returnable warrants issued to each of the Purchasers
under the MFN Agreement, and  1,086,957  returnable warrants issued to the Placement Agent, were triggered and valued using the
Black Scholes model with a volatility of  124.14 % and a risk-free rate of  3.94 % resulting in financing expenses recorded as additional
financing costs in the cumulative amount of $ 1,085,780 .
Subsequent to the periods reported
in these financial statements, such returnable warrants issued to the Purchasers were exchanged for common stock of the Company and were
terminated. See Note 14-Subsequent Events.
Any surviving Returnable Warrants
will be revalued accordingly on such date should an event of a default to the debt obligations occur, triggering exercisability.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
● Cash
and Equivalents, Receivables, Other Current Assets, Short-Term Debt, Accounts Payable, Accrued and Other Current Liabilities.
22
● The
carrying amounts of these items approximated fair value.
● Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) ASC Topic 820-10-35 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used
to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
Level 1 —
Valuations
based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 —
Valuations
based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs
that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 —
Valuations
based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market
participants. These valuations require significant judgment.
At
December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 , the Company had no outstanding derivative liabilities.
12.
Commitments and Contingencies:
● The
Company has entered into certain consulting agreements which carry commitments to pay advisors and consultants should certain events
occur. An agreement is in place with one Company Advisor that calls for total compensation over the four-year Advisor Agreement of  500,000  warrants
with an exercise price of $ 0.15  per share, of which all have vested.
● CEO
Sean Folkson has a twelve-month consulting agreement which went into effect on January 1, 2022, which will reward him with bonuses earned
of 1,000,000 warrants at a strike price of $0.50 when the Company records its first quarter with revenues over $1,000,000, an additional
3,000,000 warrants with a $0.50 strike price when the Company records its first quarter with revenues over $3,000,000, and an additional
3,000,000 warrants with a $1 strike price when the Company records its first quarter with revenues over $5,000,000. Mr. Folkson will
also be awarded warrants with a strike price of $0.50 should the Company exceed $500,000 in non-traditional retail channel revenue
during the term of the agreement, and should the Company enter into a product development or distribution partnership with a multi-national
food & beverage conglomerate during the term of the Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, those conditions were not met and therefore
nothing was accrued related to this arrangement.
● Litigation:
From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business.
However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time
that may harm our business. The Company is not aware of any such legal proceedings that we believe will have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.
23
● The
outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), including the measures to reduce its spread, and the impact on the economy, has still not
been fully predicted.
We have experienced
minimal issues with supply chain and logistics, except that there have been recent and significant increases in costs relating to freight
and packaging, including as a result of more orders being shipped outside of Walmart shipping lanes. Order processing function has been
normal to date, and our manufacturers have assured us that their operations are “business as usual” as of the time of this
filing.
It is
possible that the impact of the pandemic could make it more difficult in the future for the Company to access required growth capital,
possibly rendering us unable to meet certain debts and expenses. It is impossible to know what the future holds with regard to the virus,
both for our company and in the broader sense. There are many uncertainties regarding the current coronavirus pandemic, and the Company
is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of its business, including how it will impact its customers, vendors,
and business partners. It is difficult to know if the pandemic has materially impacted the results of operations, and we are unable to
predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our financial position and operating results due to numerous uncertainties. The Company
expects to continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and intends to make adjustments accordingly, if necessary.
13. Related Party Transactions
●
During the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2015, Mr. Folkson began accruing a consulting fee of $ 6,000  per month which the aggregate of $ 18,000
and $ 36,000  is reflected in professional fees for the three- and six-months periods December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 respectively, Mr. Folkson was owed $ 9,000
and $ 0
in unpaid consulting fees which amounts are included on the balance sheets as accrued expenses- related party.
●
On January 20, 2022, the Company entered into the Lock-Up Agreement with Mr. Folkson. For purposes of the Lock-Up Agreement, Mr. Folkson is the direct or indirect owner of  16,776,591  share of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares”), and Mr. Folkson has agreed to not transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of any Shares through February 4, 2023. The Lock-Up Agreement is substantially similar to, and serves as an extension of, the lock-up agreement previously in place between the Company and Mr. Folkson, which expired in accordance with its terms on February 4, 2022.
The Lock-Up Agreement further provides, in exchange for the agreement to lock up the Shares, that Mr. Folkson shall receive warrants to acquire  400,000  shares of Company common stock at an exercise price of $ 0.30  per share, which warrants carry a twelve month term and a cashless provision, and will expire if not exercised within the twelve month term.
On December 8, 2017, Mr. Folkson purchased Warrants, at a cost of $ 0.15  per Warrant, to acquire up to  80,000  additional shares of Company stock at a strike price of $ 0.20 , and with a term of  three years  from the date of said agreement. This purchase resulted in a reduction in the accrued consulting fees due him by $ 12,000 . Those warrants were not exercised during that timeframe and have expired. During the second quarter 2019 Mr. Folkson purchased  400,000  shares of stock at a price of $ 0.30  per share, valued at $ 120,000  which was charged to his accrual.
24
● In
addition, the Company made bonuses available to Mr. Folkson upon the Company hitting certain revenue milestones of $ 1,000,000  in
a quarter, $ 3,000,000  in a quarter, and $ 5,000,000  in a quarter.  Achieving those milestones would earn Mr. Folkson warrants
with a $0.50 and $1.00 strike price which would need to be exercised within 90 days of the respective quarterly or annual filing.  As
of December 31, 2022, those conditions were not met and therefore nothing was accrued related to this arrangement
●
In addition, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, there was $ 18,000
and $ 0
in unpaid directors fees which amounts are included on the balance sheets as accrued expenses- related party.
14.
Subsequent Events
Lock
up agreement
On
January 30, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement For Shareholder Lock-Up And Acquisition of Warrants (the “Lock-Up Agreement”),

of
16,776,644
shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares”), has agreed to not transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose

agreement currently in place between the Company and Mr. Folkson, which runs through February 4, 2023.
The
Lock-Up Agreement further provides, in exchange for the agreement to lock up the Shares, that Mr. Folkson shall receive warrants to acquire
400,000

per share (the “Warrants”). The Warrants carry a twelve-month
term and a cashless provision and will expire if not exercised within the twelve month term.

and collectively with Puritan Partners, the “Holders”).
As
previously disclosed by the Company, (a) on December 10, 2021, the Company entered into (i) that Securities Purchase Agreement, dated
as of December 10, 2021, as amended (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”), with Puritan Partners and Verition and (ii) the

Date”), all remaining principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Maturity Date (the “Owed Amount”) and the failure
to so pay the Owed Amount on the Maturity Date is an event of default and (c) on or around September 23, 2022, the Company issued to
each Holder a common stock purchase warrant for the purchase of
5,434,783
shares of the Company’s common stock (as amended from
time to time, the “Returnable Warrants”).
Pursuant
to the Forbearance Agreement as amended, among other things:
● The
Company shall pay to each Holder in cash the sum of $ 482,250.00
for the full and complete satisfaction of the Notes, which includes all
due and owing principal, interest and penalties notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Notes, as follows: (i) $ 250,000.00

shall have the right to redeem all or any portion of the Exchange Shares from each Holder by paying an amount in cash to such Holder
equal to $ 0.1109
per share being redeemed. The Holder’s sale of the Exchange Shares on or after September 24, 2023 is subject to
a leak-out until all of the Exchange Shares are sold. In addition, the Holders’ sale of any common stock of the Company owned by
them other than the Exchange Shares, shall also be subject to a leak-out during the period ending on the six month anniversary of the
date of the Forbearance Agreement.
● Each
Holder agrees to forbear from exercising its rights against the Company under its respective Note until and unless the occurrence of
any of the following events: (a) the failure of the Company to make a scheduled payment pursuant to the Forbearance Agreement, subject

Mast
Hill Loan
On
February 5, 2023 (the “Issuance Date”), the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”)
and issued and sold to Mast Hill, a Promissory Note (the “MH Note”) in the principal amount of $ 619,000.00
(actual amount
of purchase price of $ 526,150.00
plus an original issue discount (“OID”) in the amount of $ 92,850.00 ). Also pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement, in connection with the issuance of the MH Note, the Company issued (a) common stock purchase warrants (the “First
Warrants”), allowing Mast Hill to purchase an aggregate of
6,900,000
shares of the Company’s common stock and (b) common
stock purchase warrants (the “Second Warrants”), allowing Mast Hill to purchase an aggregate of
7,000,000
shares of the Company’s
common stock.
Also
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, in connection with the issuance of the MH Note, the First Warrants and the Second Warrants, the Company
granted piggy-back registration rights to Mast Hill.
The
Company paid to J.H. Darbie & Co., Inc. $ 10,000
in fees pursuant to the Company’s existing agreement with J.H. Darbie &
Co., Inc., in relation to the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. The Company is currently determining the fees payable
to Spencer Clarke LLC (which may include cash and/or warrants), pursuant to the Company’s existing agreement with Spencer Clarke
LLC, in relation to the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement.
The
Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the MH Note for required debt service.
The
maturity date of the MH Note is the 12-month anniversary of the Issuance Date, and is the date upon which the principal amount, the OID,
as well as any accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, shall be due and payable.
Mast
Hill has the right, at any time on or following the six month anniversary of the Issuance Date, to convert all or any portion of the
then outstanding and unpaid principal amount and interest (including any default interest) into common stock of the Company, at a conversion
price of $ 0.10 , subject to customary adjustments as provided in the MH Note for stock dividends and stock splits, rights offerings, pro
rata distributions, fundamental transactions and dilutive issuances. In addition, Mast Hill is entitled to deduct $ 1,750.00
from the
conversion amount upon each conversion, to cover Mast Hill’s fees associated with each conversion. Any such conversion is subject
to customary conversion limitations set forth in the MH Note so Mast Hill beneficially owns less than
4.99 % of the common stock of the
Company.
At
any time prior to the date that an Event of Default (as defined in the MH Note) occurs under the MH Note, the Company may prepay the
outstanding principal amount and interest then due under the MH Note. On any such event, the Company shall make payment to Mast Hill
of an amount in cash equal to the sum of (a)
100 % multiplied by the principal amount then outstanding plus (b) accrued and unpaid interest
on the principal amount to the prepayment date plus (c) $ 750.00
to reimburse Mast Hill for administrative fees.
26
In
addition, if, at any time prior to the full repayment or full conversion of all amounts owed under the MH Note, the Company receives
cash proceeds of more than $ 800,000
(the “Minimum Threshold”) in the aggregate from any source or series of related or unrelated
sources from the issuance of equity (subject to exclusions described in the MH Note), debt or the issuance of securities pursuant to
an Equity Line of Credit (as defined in the MH Note) of the Company, Mast Hill shall have the right in its sole discretion to require
the Company to apply up to
50 % of such proceeds after the Minimum Threshold to repay all or any portion of the outstanding principal
amount and interest then due under the MH Note.
The
MH Note contains customary Events of Default for transactions similar to the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and
the MH Note, which entitle Mast Hill, among other things, to accelerate the due date of the unpaid principal amount of, and all accrued
and unpaid interest on, the MH Note, in addition to triggering the conversion rights. Any principal amount or interest on the MH Note
which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of the lesser of (i)
16 % per annum and (ii) the maximum amount permitted by
law from the due date until the same is paid. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Mast Hill shall no longer be required to cancel
and extinguish the Second Warrants, the MH Note shall become immediately due and payable, and the Company shall pay to Mast Hill an amount
equal to the principal amount then outstanding plus accrued interest (including any default interest) through the date of full repayment
multiplied by
150 %, as well as all costs of collection.
The
MH Note contains restrictions on the Company’s ability to (a) incur additional indebtedness, (b) make distributions or pay dividends,
(c) redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire its securities, (d) sell its assets outside of the ordinary course, (e) enter into certain
affiliate transactions, (f) enter into 3(a)(9) Transactions or 3(a)(10) Transactions (each as defined in the MH Note), or (g) change
the nature of its business.
Commencing
as of the Issuance Date, and until such time as the MH Note is fully converted or repaid, the Company shall not affect or enter into
an agreement to effect any Variable Rate Transaction (as defined in the Purchase Agreement).
The
Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties made by each of the Company and Mast Hill. It further grants to
Mast Hill certain rights of participation and first refusal, and most-favored nation rights, all as set forth in the Purchase Agreement.
The
Company is subject to customary indemnification terms in favor of Mast Hill and its affiliates and certain other parties.
The
First Warrants have an initial exercise price of $ 0.10
per share, subject to customary adjustments (including price-based anti-dilution
adjustments), and may be exercised at any time until the five year anniversary of the First Warrants. The First Warrants include a cashless
exercise provision as set forth therein. The exercise of the First Warrants are subject to a beneficial ownership limitation of
4.99 %
of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. In the event of the Company’s
failure to timely deliver shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the First Warrants, the Company would be obligated to pay a “Buy-In”
amount pursuant to the terms of the First Warrants.
The
Second Warrants have an initial exercise price of $ 0.30
per share, subject to customary adjustments (including price-based anti-dilution
adjustments), and may be exercised at any time after February 5, 2024 (if not previously cancelled in accordance with the terms of the
MH Note and the Second Warrant) until the five year anniversary of such date. The Second Warrants include a cashless exercise provision
as set forth therein. The exercise of the Second Warrants are subject to a beneficial ownership limitation of
4.99 % of the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. In the event of the Company’s failure to timely
deliver shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Second Warrants, the Company would be obligated to pay a “Buy-In” amount
pursuant to the terms of the Second Warrants.
Sean
Folkson Loan
On
February 7, 2023, Sean Folkson, the Chairman and CEO of the Company, loaned $ 40,000
to the Company, which was evidenced by a promissory
note (the “Folkson Note”). The maturity date under the Folkson Note is
February 7, 2024 . The Folkson Note bears interest
at a fixed rate of
12.0 % per annum, and shall be payable on the maturity date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not make
any payment to Mr. Folkson under the Folkson Note, whether of principal or interest, and whether or not on the maturity date when due
and payable, unless and until all indebtedness of the Company owed or owing to each of Mast Hill, Puritan Partners and Verition has been
repaid in full. The Folkson Note has customary events of default.
The
Company intends to use the proceeds from the Folkson Note for working capital.
Share Issuances
● On January 6, 2023, the Company issued
336,765
shares of
its common stock for cashless exercise of
500,000
stock purchase warrants.
● On January 13, 2023, the Company issued
250,000
shares of its common stock in conjunction with a consulting

OVERVIEW
The
Nighttime Snack Problem and Opportunity
What
you eat before bed matters.
Nightfood
is pioneering the category of sleep-friendly nighttime snacking.
Research
indicates that humans are biologically hard-wired to load up on sweets and fats at night. Loading a surplus of calories (fuel) into the
body before the long nightly fast is believed to be an outdated survival mechanism from our hunter-gatherer days. Unfortunately, while
modern consumers know this type of consumption isn’t necessary for survival, willpower also weakens at night, so consumers are
more likely to succumb to these unhealthy nighttime cravings for excess “survival calories”.
28
As a result, over 85% of American adults report
snacking regularly between dinner and bed, resulting in an estimated 700 million nighttime snack occasions weekly in the US, and an annual
spend on night snacks of over $50 billion. Because of our hard-wired evolutionary preferences for calorie-dense choices that increase
the odds of short-term survival, the most popular nighttime snacks are ice cream, cookies, chips, and candy. These are all understood
to be generally unhealthy. They can also impair sleep quality.
And,
because these cravings are biologically hardwired, we believe such significant consumer spend on unhealthy nighttime snacking options
will continue. And the actual consumption of unhealthy snacks at night is expected to remain a pattern and a problem for a significant
portion of the population. We believe it’s a problem that demands a solution.
In
recent years, billions of dollars of consumer spend have shifted to better-for-you versions of consumers’ favorite snacks. But
we do not believe any of those products were nutritionally formulated to support better sleep. Nightfood snacks are not only formulated
to be better-for-you, but they’re also formulated by sleep experts and nutritionists to provide a better nutritional foundation
for quality sleep.
Almost
half of all snacking takes place between dinner and bed. Nutrition is an important part of sleep-hygiene because what one eats at night
impacts sleep. Recent industry surveys indicated that most modern consumers have begun to seek functional benefits from their snacks,
and most consumers would also prefer better sleep.
As
the pioneers of the nighttime snacking category, Nightfood accepts the responsibility to educate consumers and build the awareness required
to grow the nighttime segment of the overall snack market. Along with that responsibility comes the opportunity to be the category king.
We envision a future where nighttime specific, sleep-friendly snacks comprise a multi-billion-dollar segment of the estimated $150 billion
American snack market.
Management
believes significant latent consumer demand exists for better nighttime snacking options, and that a new consumer category, consisting
of nighttime specific snacks, is set to emerge in the coming years. This belief is supported by research from major consumer goods research
firms such as IRI Worldwide, and Mintel, who identified nighttime specific foods and beverages as one of the “most compelling and
category changing trends” for 2017 and beyond. In recent years, CEO’s and other executives from major consumer goods conglomerates
such as Nestle, PepsiCo, Mondelez, and Kellogg’s have commented on nighttime snack habits and patterns and alluded to the opportunity
that might exist in solving this problem for consumers.
Our
Scientific Advisors
Nightfood
has established a highly credentialed Scientific Advisory Board consisting of sleep and nutrition experts to drive product formulation
decisions and provide consumer confidence in the brand promise. The first member of this advisory board was Dr. Michael Grandner, Director
of the Sleep and Health Research Program at the University of Arizona. Dr. Grandner has been conducting research on the link between
nutrition and sleep for over fifteen years, and he believes improved nighttime nutritional choices can improve sleep, resulting in many
short and long-term health benefits. In March of 2018, the Company added Dr. Michael Breus to their Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Breus,
known to millions as The Sleep Doctor™, is believed to be the Nation’s most trusted authority on sleep. He regularly appears
in the national media to educate and inform consumers so they can sleep better and lead happier, healthier, more productive lives. In
July, 2018, we completed our Scientific Advisory Board with the addition of Lauren Broch, Ph.D, M.S. Dr. Broch is a sleep therapist and
former Director of Education & Training at the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Weill Cornell Medical College. Dr. Broch also has a
master’s degree in human nutrition. This combination allows her to play an important role in the formulation of Nightfood snacks.
These experts work with Company management to ensure Nightfood products deliver on their nighttime-appropriate, and sleep-friendly promises.
29
Our
Products
The
most widely consumed nighttime snacks are cookies, chips, candy, and ice cream. Our goal is to offer consumers sleep-friendly versions
of each of those snack formats as well as others.
Compared
to regular ice cream, Nightfood is formulated to contain less sugar, less fat, fewer calories, more tryptophan, more protein, more prebiotic
fiber, more vitamin B6, more calcium, magnesium, and zinc.
Nightfood ice cream has been produced in nine
flavors. These are Full Moon Vanilla, Midnight Chocolate, Cold Brew Decaf, After Dinner Mint Chip, Milk & Cookie Dough, Cherry Eclipse,
Bed and Breakfast, Cookies n’ Dreams, and Pickles For Two. The Company is currently focused on two of those flavors, Midnight Chocolate
and Cookies n’ Dreams, which are the two flavors in national hotel distribution. Pickles for Two has been discontinued, and the
other 6 flavors are not scheduled for additional production in the short term. Management anticipates bringing some or all of those flavors
back into production in the future, if and when Nightfood ice cream pints are reintroduced into supermarket distribution. Until such time,
existing inventory of those flavors will be sold off via Company website, and perhaps future appearances on QVC and other potential outlets.
Nightfood mini-cookies were introduced in September, 2022. Our Prime-Time
Chocolate Chip cookies are in limited hotel distribution and available for sale direct-to-consumer on our website. In February 2023, these
cookies became available for wholesale purchase through both US Foods Direct and Sysco’s Supplies on the Fly. Two additional flavors
of Nightfood mini-cookies, Snoozerdoodle and Date Night Cherry Oat, are expected to be produced in early 2023. Our cookies offer similar
nutritional benefits when compared to conventional cookies as our ice cream does when compared to conventional ice cream. Nightfood cookies
feature less sugar, less fat, fewer calories, more protein, more prebiotic fiber, and contain added inositol and vitamin B6.
On December 12, 2022, the Company announced two
corporate-level partnership tests for a single-serve 25-gram Nightfood Prime-Time Chocolate Chip cookie. One test is with a national hotel
chain, and the other is with an international airline.
On February 21, 2023, The Company signed a vendor
agreement with the parent company of the testing hotel chain. The hotel test is expected to begin on or before March 14, 2023. This test
is scheduled to last 30 days. If the test is successful, the hotel chain intends to make Nightfood cookies an amenity gifted to guests
at check-in. The initiation of such a program would likely be the revenue and profit contribution equivalent of Nightfood snacks securing
retail distribution in thousands of hotel lobby shops.
The airline test is currently projected to begin
on or about March 31, 2023, and is expected to last approximately 45 days. We expect both tests to execute according to the schedules
presented and be successful. However, either or both of these tests could get delayed, extended, or cancelled, and either or both may
be declared a failure by our testing partners.
Sleep-friendly
versions of additional popular nighttime snack formats are anticipated to be introduced in 2023 and beyond, subject to available funds
and interest from our hotel partners and customers. Our development roadmap includes chips, single-serve ice cream novelties, candy,
and more. We believe hotels can benefit from having sleep-friendly snacks available in their lobby shops in multiple formats, so that,
whatever snack format a guest might be in the mood for on any given night, there would be a sleep-friendly version available for them,
alongside the traditional legacy brands such as Haagen Dazs and Chips Ahoy.
Each
new Nightfood snack format would be expected to deliver sleep-friendly snacking in a way that is appropriate for that format. For example,
Nightfood chips would not necessarily contain significantly more tryptophan than other brands of chips but would be expected to be more
sleep-friendly in other ways.
The
Competitive Landscape
The nutritional/snack food business is highly
competitive and includes such participants as companies like Mondelez, Nestle S.A., Hershey’s, Hormel, Kraft/Heinz, Kellogg’s,
Ferrero, Campbell Soup Company, Utz, General Mills, Mars, Post Holdings, The Simply Good Foods Company, Wells Enterprises, Froneri, Unilever,
Hostess, PepsiCo, and more. Many of these competitors have well-established names and products.
In 2019, Nestle announced interest in the nighttime
snacking space with the introduction of a candy-type product called GoodNight. In 2020, Pepsi announced the launch of a “relaxation”
drink called Driftwell. In January 2023, Post Holdings introduced a cereal called Sweet Dreams. On the Post website, it indicates that
Sweet Dreams is “part of a healthy sleep routine” and includes a “nighttime herbal blend”. In 2021, Unilever announced
they had initiated a year-long research study to identify how nutrition could be used to improve sleep, through impact on the gut microbiome.
In September 2021, the Chief Medical Officer of Pepsi stated that Pepsi researchers were examining how foods and beverages affect neurochemical
pathways, and that the company was interested in how this research could be used to impact sleep.
30
Such
interest expressed in the link between nutrition and sleep, and the nighttime snack occasion, by some of the largest food and beverage
companies in the world, indicates to us that the opportunity we’re pursuing is both financially and strategically significant.
Nightfood
competes based upon the unique characteristics and positioning of our products and we expect to derive significant leverage from being
the pioneer and creator of the emerging night snack category. However, other companies, including those with greater name recognition
than us and greater resources may seek to introduce products that directly compete with our products. Management believes that if a competitor
sought to develop a competing product, it could do so and begin to establish retail distribution in 12-24 months.
Management
speculates that full-scale entry into our category by one of the global players would significantly benefit our Company by advancing
the growth of the category while also significantly increasing the strategic value of our brand and distribution partnerships to the
other global competitors. Such entrance into our category by a global competitor would likely force the other global snack players to
enter the space, perhaps sooner than they’re prepared for. We believe that such a hypothetical situation would likely result in
one or more suitors looking to acquire the Nightfood brand to allow them to better and more quickly compete in this potentially pivotal
consumer category.
Based
on the current acquisition climate in the consumer goods space, Management believes that successful growth of the Nightfood snack line
would likely bring acquisition offers from potential competitors as quickly as it might actually bring competition on the shelf from
those same potential competitors.
Leveraging
Hotels
Management
believes widespread distribution in the lobby shops of the world’s largest hotel chains will provide the Nightfood brand a unique
and powerful competitive advantage within the sleep-friendly nighttime snack category. In the hotel vertical, the brand can be insulated
from potential competition compared to in the supermarket environment. In addition, deep and wide hotel penetration could serve to entrench
Nightfood as the leading brand within the category, with a de-facto endorsement by the hotel industry serving as a distinct competitive
advantage for Nightfood when competing head-to-head with competitors in other segments of the marketplace.
Independent
sales data from multiple sources reinforces our belief that Nightfood snacks can compete favorably with leading national brands within
the context of hotel lobby markets. The Company expects to be able to expand its current hotel distribution based on that sales data
and the overall wellness trend that plays an important role in today’s hospitality industry.
We believe the very nature of the hotel lobby
shops, with small retail footprint and limited selection, will afford Nightfood a protected position in that high-margin vertical during
the formative years of our category. Furthermore, management believes widespread hotel rollout of Nightfood snacks will serve to validate
the concept of sleep-friendly nutrition and night snacks in the minds of consumers, potentially accelerating the adoption of the Nightfood
brand in additional relevant retail verticals.
DEVELOPMENT
PLANS
The
Company is focused on building the nighttime snack category by leveraging the expanding distribution of its snack products through hotel
lobby marketplaces.
There
are approximately 56,000 hotels in the United States. The five largest hotel companies account for approximately half of those locations,
distributed among dozens of hotel chains. Those are (in alphabetical order) Choice Hotels, Hilton Worldwide, InterContinental Hotels
Group, Marriott International, and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts.
Management is working directly with three of those
five companies to establish expansion and/or introduction of Nightfood snacks. Two of those companies have executed corporate-level tests
of Nightfood ice cream sales in some of their hotel locations, and both have declared those tests successful. Management expects corporate-level
commitment to the introduction of sleep-friendly snacks from these and other major hotel chains, despite experiencing delays in scaling
distribution related to changes in hotel personnel, priorities, and timelines.
31
Hotel
lobby shops continue to evolve in terms of size, product assortment, and increased emphasis from hotel brands as a source of revenue
and customer service and satisfaction.
Management
believes hotels have an obligation to support wellness and better sleep for their guests at every touchpoint. Unfortunately, the most
popular snacks in hotel lobby shops tend to be both unhealthy, and disruptive to sleep quality.
With
focus on sleep and wellness trending powerfully within the hospitality vertical, Management believes sleep-friendly nighttime snacks
will soon become standard within the hotel industry, and that Nightfood will remain the leading brand as the category matures.
As
a result of our decision to focus on highly relevant and higher-margin hotel distribution, we have temporarily shifted our focus away
from traditional supermarket distribution. While it is likely that Nightfood pints can still be found on shelves in certain supermarkets,
we have no supermarket distribution relationships that we would consider active currently. Management expects widespread hotel distribution
to generate significant incremental sales with higher gross and net margins than the supermarket vertical, where slotting, advertising,
and trade promotion expenses make profitability more difficult to attain. More importantly, we believe hotels are where our brand can
thrive, even against the most popular legacy brands in snacking.
Hotel Distribution
In May, 2022, one of the five global hotel companies
mentioned in this section launched Nightfood ice cream into one of their hotel chains, an extended-stay hotel brand which contains approximately
500 properties in the United States. To date, our pints have been placed in approximately 300 – 350 of those properties, with more
of the properties adding our ice cream over time.
In September, 2022, as a result of successful
sales results observed in that first hotel chain, that company notified Management that Nightfood pints would begin to be introduced in
two of their additional chains, comprising over 3,000 additional properties. That introduction was expected to begin in October, 2022.
Subsequent internal restructuring at the hotel company resulted in delays and modifications to that plan which are being worked on currently.
Management is actively working with the new decision-makers with our goal of establishing Nightfood distribution across multiple hotel
chains, including the two aforementioned chains, and other national chains within that company.
Nightfood has been introduced into approximately
500 hotel lobby shops across the United States. This includes select locations from leading national and international hotel chains such
as Holiday Inn Express, Fairfield Inn, Courtyard by Marriott, Hyatt House, Staybridge Suites, Candlewood Suites, Springhill Suites, and
more.
Nightfood ice cream is available for hotels to purchase nationally
through Vistar, a leading national wholesale distributor serving the hospitality vertical. After a months-long process, in February of
2023, Nightfood cookies secured dropship distribution through US Foods Direct and through Sysco’s Supplies on the Fly. US Foods
and Sysco are leading broadline distributors that sell extensively to the hotel industry.
Recent
Hotel Sales Data
Impulsify
is an industry leader in hotel marketplace intelligence, compiling real-time proprietary retail sales data from millions of hotel retail
transactions rung into their point-of-sale solutions. Impulsify data was analyzed for the months of July 2022 through December 2022,
across the subset of approximately 30 Impulsify-reporting hotels which sold both Nightfood and Haagen Dazs pints, and no other brands.
During that 6-month period, reports showed that Nightfood captured 37.9% of the unit sales while Haagen Dazs captured 62.1%. The average
selling price for Nightfood in those hotels was $.28 higher per pint than Haagen Dazs.
A
separate set of independent point-of-sale data, with zero overlap to the previously mentioned data set, showed Nightfood outselling Ben
& Jerry’s and Baskin Robbins pints in a controlled test which included more than 30 lobby shops, across many popular hotel
brands. Pints from all three brands were priced at $8.50. Nightfood captured 43% of the total pint volume, Ben & Jerry’s had
34%, and Baskin Robbins had 23%. This data was collected over nine weeks ending October 31, 2022.
32
During
the first six weeks of the test, ads for Nightfood were run in a segment of the hotels. Surprisingly, Nightfood had stronger relative
sales in the hotels without ads. For the final three weeks, there were no ads for any of the brands in any of the properties. With all
ads removed, Nightfood’s sales remained constant while the other brands sales decreased. As a result, Nightfood’s share of
overall pint sales surged from 40% in the first six weeks to 50% for the final three weeks.
The
conclusions drawn from the test were that ads for Nightfood ice cream pints actually lifted sales of the more well-known competitors
(which is not uncommon), and that sleep-friendly Nightfood, without ads, was decisively the top-selling pint for the entire test period.
The
Future
Management
believes strong sales results in hotels relative to well-established, decades-old national brands will enable Nightfood to secure additional
hotel chain brand-level distribution arrangements for our sleep-friendly snacks.
While
the dollar value of ice cream pint sales in any individual hotel shop are understood to be modest, Nightfood’s strong relative
sales data obtained over recent months, and so quickly after our launch, affirms our belief that sleep-friendly snacks can sell very
well alongside legacy snack brands in the high-margin hotel environment.
The
Company anticipates adding new distribution in thousands of hotels in the coming months through relationships it has established with
some of the largest companies in the world in the hospitality vertical. We have built what we believe is a very valuable network and
distribution infrastructure, which includes global hospitality companies, group purchasing organizations, hotel management groups, and
distributors.
The
Company is currently finalizing coordination of two tests of individually-wrapped 25 gram Nightfood Prime-Time Chocolate Chip cookies
as an amenity. One test is with an international airline, and the other is with a national hotel chain with several hundred properties
in the United States.
On February 21, 2023, The Company signed a vendor
agreement with the parent company of the testing hotel chain. The hotel test is expected to begin on or before March 14, 2023. This test
is scheduled to last 30 days. If the test is successful, the hotel chain intends to make Nightfood cookies an amenity gifted to guests
at check-in. The initiation of such a program would likely be the revenue and profit contribution equivalent of Nightfood snacks securing
retail distribution in thousands of hotel lobby shops.
The airline test is currently projected to begin
on or about March 31, 2023, and is expected to last approximately 45 days. We expect both tests to execute according to the schedules
presented and be successful. However, either or both of these tests could get delayed, extended, or cancelled, and either or both may
be declared a failure by our testing partners.
As we add retail and amenity distribution and
exposure in additional hotels and chains, we believe such distribution will create added pressure on the rest of the hotel industry to
also offer sleep-friendly snacks or risk falling behind in the eyes of wellness-conscious travelers.
We believe that consumers seeing our snacks in
some of the most trusted hotel chains in the United States will drive awareness not only of our brand, but of the fact that what one eats
before bed can impact sleep quality. We believe broad acceptance of this key consumer insight will help bring the nighttime snacking category
to life.
In
addition to revenue growth, increased awareness, and operating profitability, Management believes that national hotel distribution of
its sleep-friendly nighttime snacks will provide the foundation on which the nighttime snack category can be built.
The
primary goal of the company is to successfully develop and nurture the nighttime snack category.
Management
believes that success in attaining this goal will create significant value for shareholders, as it would likely result in Nightfood not
only being the category pioneer, but also establishing a position from which Nightfood can remain the dominant brand in this potential
multi-billion dollar consumer category.
INFLATION
Inflation
can be expected to have an impact on our operating costs. Similar to many other industries, we have recently seen increases in the cost
of certain ingredients and packaging materials. Such increases will either result in lower gross margins or necessitate an increase in
our wholesale pricing. A prolonged period of inflation could cause a general economic downturn and negatively impact our results.
33
SEASONALITY
With
a focus on distribution of our snacks in hotels over the next 1-2 years before we envision revisiting a focus on supermarkets, a certain
amount of seasonality is expected. As U.S. hotel occupancy has a history of peaking in June and July, with occupancy rates approximately
10% above the average, it is possible that we will experience an increase in sales related to that occupancy peak.
As
an early-stage and growing brand, with a product mix that is expected to include a variety of snacks such as ice cream, cookies, chips,
candy, and more, the full impact of seasonality on our business might not be fully understood for several additional annual cycles.
CORONAVIRUS
(COVID-19)
The
outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), including the measures to reduce its spread, and the impact on the economy, has still not
been fully predicted.
We
have experienced minimal issues with supply chain and logistics, except that there have been recent and significant increases in costs
relating to freight and packaging. Order processing function has been normal to date, and our manufacturers have assured us that their
operations are “business as usual” as of the time of this filing.
It
is possible that the impact of the pandemic could make it more difficult in the future for the Company to access required growth capital,
possibly rendering us unable to meet certain debts and expenses.
It
is impossible to know what the future holds with regard to the virus, both for our company and in the broader sense. There are many uncertainties
regarding the current coronavirus pandemic, and the Company is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of its business,
including how it will impact its customers, vendors, and business partners. It is difficult to know if the pandemic has materially impacted
the results of operations, and we are unable to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our financial position and operating results
due to numerous uncertainties. The Company expects to continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and intends to
make adjustments accordingly, if necessary.
RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021.
For the three months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 we had Gross Sales of $38,424 and $104,463 and Net Revenues (Net Revenues are defined as Gross Sales,
less slotting fees, promotions, rebates, coupons and sales discounts, and certain other revenue reductions) of $13,369 and $79,374 respectively
and incurred a net operating loss of $677,539 and $478,390 respectively.

The
decrease in Gross Sales relative to the same period in 2021 was largely the result of our strategic pivot away from supermarket distribution
to focus exclusively on the higher context and higher margin hotel vertical, where our products can more favorably compete against more
established traditional brands.
Furthermore,
the hotel sales project to be significantly more profitable on a per unit basis, as sales will be conducted at full wholesale pricing,
and line items such as slotting, advertising, and pricing promotions project to be greatly reduced or entirely eliminated.
For the three months ended December 31 2022 and 2021, Cost of Product
Sold totaled $41,996 and $88,105, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Cost of Product Sold exceeded Net Revenues
due to the fact that our freight costs remain significantly elevated on a per-unit basis in the short term due to the fact that most of
the orders shipped to our wholesale customers during this period were partial pallets to accommodate our current ramp-up phase. As more
points of distribution are added, average order sizes are expected to increase, which is expected to significantly drive down freight
costs as a percentage of sales, improving margins and ultimately allowing for profitability.
34
Selling,
General, and Administrative expenses increased from $72,316 in the three months ended December 31, 2021 to $104,292 in the three months
ended December 31, 2022 largely due to increases in insurance expense, web services, and fees relating to fundraising activities such
as filing fees and transfer agent fees.
For the three months
ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, total operating expenses increased to $690,908 from $557,764. This was a direct result of increases
to professional fees and Selling, General, and Administrative expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2022, offset by a substantial
reduction in advertising and promotion period over period. The increase in professional fees is largely due to fees related to our RegA+
filing and related fundraising efforts along with non-cash expenses related to certain financing provisions including the repricing of
certain warrants and a default on certain notes.
For the three months
ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, total Other Expenses increased to $3,882,723 from $302,529. The majority of the other expenses category
consist of non-cash expenses related to financing events.
For the three months
ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 we incurred net losses of $4,560,262 and $780,919 respectively. This increase in net losses is due largely
to increases in other expenses (non-cash) related to financing activities.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SIX MONTH
PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021.
For the six months ended
December 31, 2022, and 2021 we had Gross Sales of $137,647 and $293,394 and Net Revenues of $93,339 and $193,827, respectively, and incurred
operating losses of $1,236,146 and $1,312,065 respectively.

For the six months ended

due to the fact that our freight costs remain significantly elevated on a per-unit basis in the short term due to the fact that most of

points of distribution are added, average order sizes are expected to increase, which is expected to significantly drive down freight
costs as a percentage of sales, improving margins and ultimately allowing for profitability.
Selling,
General, and Administrative expenses decreased from $344,953 in the six months ended December 31, 2021 to $230,636 in the six months
ended December 31, 2022 largely due to decreases in research & development and investor relations.
35
For the six months ended
December 31, 2022, and 2021, total operating expenses decreased to $1,329,485 from $1,505,892. This was a direct result of substantial
decreases to Selling, General, and Administrative expenses, and advertising expenses in the six months ended December 31, 2022, offset
by a substantial increase in professional fees. The increase in professional fees is largely due to fees related to our RegA+ filing and
related fundraising efforts along with non-cash expenses related to certain financing provisions including the repricing of certain warrants
and a default on certain notes, and the debt financing which occurred in September 2022.
For the six months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, total Other Expenses increased to $4,525,226 from $302,529. The majority of the other expenses category consist
of non-cash expenses related to financing events.
For the six months ended
December 31, 2022, and 2021 we incurred net losses of $5,761,372 and $1,614,594 respectively. This increase in net losses is due largely
to increases in non-cash expenses and non-cash professional fees related to our recent financing activities.
Customers
During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had one customer account for approximately 35% of the gross sales, one customer accounted
for approximately 26% of gross sales, and one customer accounted for approximately 12% and another customer accounted for approximately
10% of gross sales. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company had one customer account for 26% of the gross sales. One
other customer accounted for 18% of the gross sales and two other customers each account for more than 10% of the gross sales.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had one customer account for approximately 74% of the gross sales. One other customer
accounted for approximately 23% of gross sales.. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company had one customer account
for 36% of the gross sales. One other customer accounted for 22% of the gross sales.
LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As
of December 31, 2022, we had cash on hand of $49,008, receivables of $74,421 and inventory value of $453,617.
Our cash on hand is not adequate to satisfy our
long-term working capital needs or to satisfy our existing and expected liabilities as they become due. While we continue to believe that
our current capitalization structure, combined with ongoing increases in distribution, revenues, and market capitalization, will enable
us to successfully secure required financing to continue our growth, we can give no assurances of success in this regard considering the
delays experienced in the roll-out of our products in the hotel vertical.
On October 24, 2022, the Company launched a Tier
2 offering pursuant to Regulation A (also known as “Regulation A+”) with the intent to raise capital through an equity crowdfunding
campaign. We believe this offering, if we successfully raise the maximum amount being offered, will enable us to eliminate all corporate
debt and operate the company until significant growth milestones are achieved, perhaps including attaining profitability; however, we
believe that as a result of the delays experienced in the roll-out of our products in the hotel vertical, we have not been as successful
as we had expected to be with respect to the Regulation A+ offering.
Because
the business has limited operating history and sales, no certainty of continuation can be stated. Management has devoted a significant
amount of time in the raising of capital from additional debt and equity financing. However, the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern will again be dependent upon raising additional funds through debt and equity financing, including our Regulation
A+ offering, and generating revenue. There are no assurances the Company will receive the necessary funding or generate revenue necessary
to fund operations long-term.
36
The
Company cannot give any assurance that it will, in the future, be able to achieve a level of profitability from the sale of its products
to sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability and reclassification
of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Since our inception, we have sustained operating
losses. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred a net loss of $4,560,262 compared to $780,919 for the three months
ended December 31, 2021. The majority of our net loss for this current reporting period is related to the way certain financing activities
were accounted for, and not related to losses from business operations.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022,
net cash used in operating activities was $738,165 compared to net cash used of $1,440,431 for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
This decrease is largely due to an increase in accounts payable and the impact of various noncash financing activities for the six months
ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year.
We
did not use any cash in investing activities, during the six months ended December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2022.
During the six months ended December 31, 2021,
net cash aggregating $1,193,034 was provided by financing activities, compared to $506,296 for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
In the Six months ended December 31, 2021, our financing activities consisted of sales of our Series B Preferred Stock and proceeds from
debt financing. In the six months ended December 31, 2022, our financing activities consisted of the issuance of debt in the form of convertible
promissory notes and sales of Reg A units for cash, offset by repayments of previously incurred convertible notes.
From our inception in January 2010 through December
31, 2022, we have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately $37,548,495. This is not debt and this is not an amount that needs
to be paid out at any point in the future. An accumulated deficit reflects a negative balance of retained earnings and an accumulation
of historical losses over time, related to both operations and financing activities. It is not unusual for early-stage companies to have
significant accumulated deficit, even after turning profitable. Many large, fast growing, and successful companies have reported accumulated
deficits in recent years, such as Warby Parker, The Honest Company, Beyond Meat, Roblox, Robinhood, Sweetgreen, Oatly, Rivian, Celsius
Holdings, Chobani, and Tesla. In our case, like many of these others, an accumulated deficit is a function of losses sustained over time,
along with the costs associated with raising operating capital.
Assuming
we raise additional funds and continue operations, we expect to incur additional operating losses during the next two to four quarters
and possibly thereafter. We plan to continue to pay or satisfy existing obligations and commitments and finance our operations, as we
have in the past, primarily through the sale of our securities and other forms of external financing until such time that we are able
to generate sufficient funds from the sale of our products to finance our operations, of which we can give no assurance.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate past judgments and our estimates,
including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for inventory write-downs and write offs, deferred income taxes,
provision for contractual obligations and our ability to continue as a going concern. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements,
presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, describe the significant accounting estimates and
policies used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. There were no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates
during the six months ended December 31, 2022.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Disclosure and control procedures are also designed to ensure that such information
is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures.
We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December
31, 2022. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that there are inherent limitations
to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable
assurance of achieving their desired control objectives. Additionally, in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures,
management is required to apply its reasonable judgment. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective at December 31, 2022 due to the lack of full-time accounting and management personnel. We
will consider hiring additional employees when we obtain sufficient capital.
As
funds become available to us, we expect to implement additional measures to improve disclosure controls and procedures such as implementing
and documenting our internal controls procedures.
Changes
in internal controls over financial reporting
There
was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report, which has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls
A
control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s
objectives will be met. The Company’s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and its Principal Financial Officer,
do not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also
be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.
The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be
no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
We are not engaged in any litigation or governmental regulatory proceeding
at the present time, and management is unaware of any other claims or complaints that could result in future litigation or proceeding,
in any case that would or would be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on us or our business.
Management will seek to minimize disputes with its customers but recognizes the inevitability of legal action in today’s business
environment as an unfortunate price of conducting business.

2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.
● During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued an aggregate of 586,111 shares of its common stock for cashless
exercise of 750,000 stock purchase warrants. The securities were issued in a private transaction in reliance upon an exemption from registration
pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, as a transaction not involving any public offering.
● During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold 457,350 units at $0.50 per unit, each unit consisting of 4 shares of common
stock and 4 share purchase warrants, for a total of 1,829,400 shares of common stock under its Regulation A+ Offering. The Company received
net proceeds of $224,615. The securities were issued in a private transaction in reliance upon an exemption from registration pursuant
to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, as a transaction not involving any public offering.
● During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, holders of the B Preferred converted 960 shares of Series B Preferred Stock into 4,800,000 shares
of its common stock. The securities were issued in a private transaction in reliance upon an exemption from registration pursuant to
Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act.
ITEM
3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES.
On
December 10, 2021 the Company entered into certain agreements including Secured Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Notes”)
and
Securities Purchase Agreements with certain accredited and institutional investors (the “Purchasers”)
for the purchase and sale of an aggregate $1,086,956.52 in proceeds. The Notes, for as long as they are outstanding, are secured
by all assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, senior secured guarantees of the subsidiaries of the Company, and pledges of the common
stock of all the subsidiaries of the Company. The Notes have provisions allowing for repayment at any time at 115% of the outstanding
principal and interest within the first three months, and 120% of the outstanding principal and interest at any time thereafter.
During the six months ended December 31, 2022 the Company made certain repayments, however, the Company was required to pay to the Purchasers
on December 10, 2022, as extended to December 29, 2022 (as so extended, the “Maturity Date”) all remaining principal and
accrued and unpaid interest on the Maturity Date (the “Owed Amount”). The Owed Amount was not paid by the Company in accordance
with the terms of the Notes during the six months ended December 31, 2022, and the failure to so pay the Owed Amount on the Maturity
Date created an event of default. At December 31, 2022, the Owed Principal Amount, including default penalties, totaled $905,767. Subsequent
to the December 31, 2022 the Company entered into a forbearance agreement with the Purchasers whereby the Purchasers have agreed to forbear
on all rights against the Company provided the Company adheres to the agreed-upon payment schedule to satisfy the notes in full.
