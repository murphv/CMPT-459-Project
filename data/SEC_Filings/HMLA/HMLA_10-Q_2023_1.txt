ORGANIZATION
Himalaya
Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 8, 2003. The Company’s
principal historical activities had been the acquisition of a mineral property in the State of New Mexico. During the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2010, the Company began to acquire working interests in a seismic exploration program as well as a drilling program in crude
oil and natural gas properties in Oklahoma. Prior to July 31, 2019 the Company discontinued the exploration and drilling in Oklahoma
and New Mexico. The Company has leases on two properties that were fully depleted prior to July 31, 2021. Over the past few years, the
company generated approximately $ 1,500
per year of net revenue from these leases. During the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company
reached an agreement with the Company’s prior CEO to distribute the oil leases in payment of loan from shareholder.
On
June 28, 2021, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to “Himalaya Technologies, Inc.”
from Homeland Resources Ltd.
The
Company’s business plan includes completing its’ social site Kanab.Club targeting health and wellness based on the cannabis
market, generating revenues from advertising and subscriptions, incorporating social media site into the site, and marketing its
19.9 %
investment GenBio, Inc.’s health and wellness products targeting anti-inflammatory nutraceuticals to consumers. Additionally, the
Company intends to pursue growth of its minority investment in agriculture technology in The Agrarian Group, LLC (“TAG”).

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all disclosures normally required in annual consolidated financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022.
In
management’s opinion, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual
financial statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of
the Company’s financial position as of January 31, 2023 and the results of operations and cash flows for the three and six months
ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. The results of operations for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the full year or any other future interim or annual period.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant
estimates include accounts payable, the recoverability of long-term assets, and the valuation of derivative liabilities.

Consolidation
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company, and its wholly owned subsidiary, KANAB CORP. All
material intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in the consolidation.
Cash
Cash
consists of deposits in two large national banks. On January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively, the Company had $ 1,082
and $ 4,141
in cash in the United States. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risks
on its cash in bank accounts.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
For
certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash accounts payable, accrued liabilities, short-term debt, and derivative
liability, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. We adopted ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures,”, which requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic
825, “Financial Instruments,” defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair
value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets
for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because
of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate
of interest. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of valuation hierarchy
are defined as follows:
Level
1 input to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level
2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
Level
3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop
its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value
drivers are unobservable.
The
Company’s analyses of all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480, “Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity,” and ASC 815.
The
Company has recorded the conversion option on notes as a derivative liability because of the variable conversion price, which in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, prevents them from being considered as indexed to our stock and qualified for an exception to derivative accounting.
The
Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets at fair value. We record
changes in the fair value of the derivatives in the accompanying statement of operations.

Earnings
Per Share (EPS)
Basic
EPS is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted EPS is computed similar to basic net income per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number
of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all the potential common shares, warrants and stock options had been
issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted EPS assumes that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options
were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method for the outstanding options and the if-converted
method for the outstanding convertible preferred shares. Under the treasury stock method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised
at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common
stock at the average market price during the period. Under the if-converted method, convertible outstanding instruments are assumed to
be converted into common stock at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later). During the three months ended January
31, 2023 and 2022, the Company generated no revenues and incurred substantial losses, of which the vast majority were due to mostly non-cash
charges for accrued interest, penalties and derivative charges related to convertible debt instruments. Therefore, the effect of any
common stock equivalents on EPS is anti-dilutive during those periods.
Income
Taxes
The
Company utilizes FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that were included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under
this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable
to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary,
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

ASC
740 provides accounting and disclosure guidance about positions taken by an organization in its tax returns that might be uncertain.
When tax returns are filed, it is likely that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while
others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during
which,
based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination,
including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is
more
than 50 percent
likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated
with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits
in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon
examination. Interest associated with unrecognized tax benefits is classified as interest expense and penalties are classified in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the statements of income.

January 31, 2023, and July 31, 2022, the Company had not taken any significant uncertain tax positions on its tax returns for the period
ended July 31, 2022 and prior years or in computing its tax provisions for any years. Prior management considered its tax positions and
believed that all of the positions taken by the Company in its Federal and State tax returns were more likely than not to be sustained
upon examination. The Company is subject to examination by U.S. Federal and State tax authorities from inception to present, generally
for three years after they are filed. New management, which took control of the Company on June 21, 2021, is currently evaluating prior
management’s decision to not file federal tax returns and plans on filing past returns and related 1099 filings for compensation
paid to prior management, employees, consultants, contractors, and affiliates. The Company does not believe it has a material tax liability
due to its operating losses in these periods but is preparing tax filings to bring itself current as it completes and moves forward on
announced mergers and acquisitions.
Concentration
of Credit Risk
Cash
is mainly maintained by one highly qualified institution in the United States. At various times, such amounts are more than federally
insured limits. Management does not believe that the Company is subject to any unusual financial risk beyond the normal risk associated
with commercial banking relationships. The Company has not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash.
Risks
and Uncertainties
The
Company is subject to risks from, among other things, competition associated with the industry in general, other risks associated with
financing, liquidity requirements, rapidly changing customer requirements, limited operating history and the volatility of public markets.
Crude
Oil and Natural Gas Properties
The
Company follows the full cost accounting method to account for crude oil and natural gas properties, whereby costs incurred in the acquisition,
exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized. Such costs include lease acquisition, geological and
geophysical activities, rentals on non-producing leases, drilling, completing and equipping of crude oil and natural gas wells and administrative
costs directly attributable to those activities and asset retirement costs. Disposition of crude oil and natural gas properties are accounted
for as a reduction of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized unless, such adjustment would significantly alter the relationship
between capital costs and proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas, in which case the gain or loss is recognized to income.

(UNAUDITED)
The
capitalized costs of crude oil and natural gas properties, excluding unevaluated and unproved properties, are amortized using the units-of-production
method based on estimated proved recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves. Amortization of unevaluated and unproved property costs
begins when the properties become proved or their values become impaired. Impairment of unevaluated and unproved prospects is assessed
periodically based on a variety of factors, including management’s intention with regard to future exploration and development
of individually significant properties and the ability of the Company to obtain funds to finance such exploration and development.
Under
full cost accounting rules for each cost center, capitalized costs of evaluated crude oil and natural gas properties, including asset
retirement costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount (the “cost ceiling”)
equal to the sum of (a) the present value of future net cash flows from estimated production of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves,
based on current economic and operating conditions, discounted at 10%, plus (b) the cost of properties not being amortized, plus (c)
the lower of cost or estimated fair value of any unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, less (d) any income tax effects
related to differences between the book and tax basis of the properties involved. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess
is charged to earnings.
Given
the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, it is reasonably possible that the estimate of discounted future net cash flows from
proved crude oil and natural gas reserves could change in the near term. If crude oil and natural gas prices decline in the future, even
if only for a short period of time, it is possible that additional impairments of crude oil and natural gas properties could occur. In
addition, it is reasonably possible that additional impairments could occur if costs are incurred in excess of any increases in the present
value of future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves, or if properties are sold for proceeds less than the discounted
present value of the related proved crude oil and natural gas reserves.
The
crude oil and gas properties are fully depleted.
During
the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company reached an agreement with its former CEO to sell the Company’s interest in
all of its crude oil and natural gas properties
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company recognizes revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ ASC” ) 606 – Contracts with
Customers. Revenue from sales of products is recognized when the related performance obligation is satisfied. The Company’s performance
obligation is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to customers.
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for all stock-based compensation using a fair value-based method. The fair value of equity-classified awards granted
to employees is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the related stock-based compensation
expense is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.
Intangible
Assets
The
Company’s intangible assets include the Kanab.Club website, which was developed for external use. The Company carries these intangibles
at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, estimated
to be
5
years. Costs that are incurred to produce the finished product after technological feasibility has been established are capitalized
as an intangible asset. The company performs periodic reviews to ensure that unamortized program costs remain recoverable from future
revenue.

Goodwill
and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
The
Company initially records goodwill and other acquired intangible assets at their estimated fair values and reviews these assets periodically
for impairment. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and is tested at least annually for impairment, historically during our fourth
quarter.
Derivative
Liabilities
The
Company assessed the classification of its derivative financial instruments as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, which consist of
convertible instruments and warrants in the Company’s common stock and determined that such derivatives meet the criteria for liability
classification under ASC 815.
ASC
815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and
account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic
characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and
risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is
not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported
in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered
a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument
is deemed to be conventional, as described.
The
Company uses judgment in determining the fair value of derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and at every balance sheet thereafter
and in determining which valuation method is most appropriate for the instrument, the expected volatility, the implied risk-free interest
rate, as well as the expected dividend rate, if any.

GOING CONCERN
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, which contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company reported an accumulated deficit of $ 8,471,768
as of January 31, 2023. The Company also had negative working capital of $ 1,347,574
at January 31, 2023, and had operating losses of
$ 163,053
and $ 62,837
for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. To date, these losses and deficiencies have been
financed principally through the issuance of common stock, loans from related parties and loans from third parties.
In
view of the matters described, there is substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern without a
significant infusion of capital. The Company anticipates that we will have to raise additional capital to fund operations over the next
12 months. To the extent that the Company is required to raise additional funds to acquire properties, and to cover costs of operations,
the Company intends to do so through additional offerings of debt or equity securities. There are no commitments or arrangements for
other offerings in place, no guaranties that any such financings would be forthcoming, or as to the terms of any such financings. Any
future financing may involve substantial dilution to existing investors.

INCOME TAXES
The
Company did not file its federal tax returns for fiscal years from 2012 through 2022. Management at year-end 2022 believed that it should
not have any material impact on the Company’s financials because the Company did not have any tax liabilities due to net loss incurred
during these years.
Based
on the available information and other factors, management believes it is more likely than not that any potential net deferred tax assets
on January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 will not be fully realizable.

Item
2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation
This
10−Q contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth as a result of general
economic conditions and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable
Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events.
Plan
of Operations
Himalaya
Technologies, Inc. a/k/a Homeland Resources Ltd. (“Himalaya”, “HMLA,” “us,” “we,” the
“Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 8, 2003. The Company’s principal historical
activities had been the acquisition of a mineral property in the State of New Mexico. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2010, the
Company began to acquire working interests in a seismic exploration program as well as a drilling program in crude oil and natural gas
properties in Oklahoma. Prior to July 31, 2019 the Company discontinued the exploration and drilling in Oklahoma and New Mexico. The
Company has leases on two properties that were fully depleted prior to July 31, 2019. Over the past few years, the company generated
approximately $1,500 per year of net revenue from these leases. Subsequent to July 31, 2022 the Company reached an agreement with the
prior CEO to distribute the oil leases in payment of loan from shareholder. Our intended plan of operations is to develop and enhance
our social site Kanab.Club targeting health and wellness in the cannabis media market supplemented by strategic acquisitions and investments
in GenBio, Inc. and other potential to be determined opportunities. On June 28, 2021, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation
to change the name of the Company to Himalaya Technologies, Inc. from Homeland Resources Ltd.
Our
business plan includes completing our social site Kanab.Club targeting health and wellness focused on the cannabis market, generating
revenues from advertising and subscriptions, incorporating social media site into the site, and marketing our planned 19.9% investment
GenBio, Inc.’s health and wellness products targeting anti-inflammatory nutraceuticals to consumers. In the future, in partnership
with GenBio, Inc., we plan to introduce a health and wellness energy and anti-inflammatory beverage product under the brand “FOMO”
or other to drive growth. We are currently in preliminary discussions with co-pack and distribution companies, and GenBio, Inc. is formulating
its extracts and obtaining laboratory certification for this planned consumer beverage, though there can be no assurance of a successful
product formulation or distribution.
The
Company has one wholly owned subsidiary, KANAB CORP. The Company has two investments, GenBio, Inc. and The Agrarian Group, LLC. The Company
owns 19.9% of GenBio, Inc. and 19.9% of The Agrarian Group, LLC.
KANAB
CORP. is a development stage company targeting information services for the cannabis industry using its social site Kanab.Club (https://kanab.club/).
We do not offer e-commerce services at this time or touch the cannabis plant and, given these matters, do not believe regulatory oversight
or rules of law are a risk factor to our business.
On
November 28, 2021 we executed a 19.9% stock purchase with GenBio, Inc. (“GenBio”; https://www.genbioinc.com/) a provider
of nutraceutical products and services based on proprietary biotechnology that fight inflammation and high blood pressure. We issued
99,686 series B Preferred shares of stock for 2,036,188 common shares of GenBio, Inc., representing 19.9% ownership. Based on a stock
price at closing of .0019 and 99,685,794 common stock equivalents, this values the investment at $189,749. The GenBio transaction is
being accounted for as an investment on our balance sheet. We will not consolidate GenBio’s financial statements.
On
January 1, 2022, the Company executed a 19.9% stock purchase with The Agrarian Group LLC (“TAG”; http://www.theagrariangroup.com/),
a provider of digital intelligence “AgtechDi” software designed from its granted patents to optimize the food supply chain
by increasing food safety and profitability for growers who operate vertical farms, greenhouses, converted shipping containers, and other
forms of controlled environment agriculture. TAG is focusing its technology on the broad produce market, but in the future may offer
it to cannabis cultivators. TAG is a software platform and will never touch the cannabis plant, eliminating regulatory risk, in our view.
Under the Investment Agreement, we issued TAG 99,686 Series B Preferred shares in exchange for 1,242,000 Class A Membership units of
TAG. Based on a stock price at closing of .0012 and 99,868,000 common stock equivalents, this values the investment at $119,841. The
TAG transaction is being accounted for as an investment on our balance sheet. We will not consolidate TAG’s financial statements.

Costs

Himalaya
Technologies, Inc. is currently pursuing additional funding resources that will potentially enable it to maintain its current and planned
operations through the next 12 months. The Company anticipates that it will need to raise additional capital in order to sustain and
grow its operations over the next few years. To the extent that the Company’s capital resources are insufficient to meet current
or planned operating requirements, the Company will seek additional funds through equity or debt financing, collaborative or other arrangements
with corporate partners, licensees or others, and from other sources, which may have the effect of diluting the holdings of existing
shareholders. As of January 31, 2023, the Company had no current arrangements with respect to, or sources of, such additional financing
and the Company does not anticipate that existing shareholders or creditors will provide any portion of the Company’s future financing
requirements. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available when needed or that such financing will be available
on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay or terminate expenditures
for certain of its programs that it would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize. This would have a material adverse effect on the
Company.
The
Company’s shareholder voting control is effectively controlled by its chairman and CEO, Vikram P. Grover, due to his ownership
of (i) all 1,000,000 of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock which has voting power of 100,000 votes
per share and (ii) 174,594 shares of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock directly (31.9% of that class’s outstanding shares)
and 150,000 shares of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock indirectly through a Company he controls (27.4%) which have 1,000
votes per share. With this voting power, Mr. Grover, can determine the outcome of any matter put to a shareholder vote including taking
corporate actions by shareholder consent.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources
We
have incurred losses since the inception of our business and as of January 31, 2023 we had an accumulated deficit of $8,471,768. As of
January 31, 2023, the Company had cash balance of $1,082 and negative working capital of $1,347,574.
To
date, we have funded our operations through short-term debt and equity financing. During the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company
received $39,250, less $4,250 in expenses, in third party lending.
We
expect our expenses will continue to increase during the foreseeable future as a result of increased operational expenses and the development
of our automobile business. However, we do not expect to start generating revenues from our operations for another 12 months. Consequently,
we are dependent on the proceeds from future debt or equity investments to sustain our operations and implement our business plan. If
we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will be required to delay or forego some portion of our business plan, which would have
a material adverse effect on our anticipated results from operations and financial condition. There is no assurance that we will be able
to obtain necessary amounts of additional capital or that our estimates of our capital requirements will prove to be accurate. As of
the date of this Report we did not have any commitments from any source to provide such additional capital. Even if we are able to secure
outside financing, it may be unavailable in the amounts or the times when we require.
Furthermore,
such financing would likely take the form of bank loans, private placement of debt or equity securities or some combination of these.
The issuance of additional equity securities would dilute the stock ownership of current investors while incurring loans, leases or debt
would increase our capital requirements and possible loss of valuable assets if such obligations were not repaid in accordance with their
terms.
Delinquent
Loans
Our
third-party loan of $151,500 from GS Capital Partners funded in June 2021 is currently in default, though we have not been given a notice
of such by the lender and are in negotiations to satisfy the obligation amicably.
