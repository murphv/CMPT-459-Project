From May of 1995 through December of 1997 the Company had minimal operations and was seeking funding for operations and companies to which it could merge or acquire. In March of 1998 the Company began operations again in California. From 1998 through 2000, the business produced and sold CD- ROMS for conference events, advertisement sales on the CD’s, database management and event marketing all associated with conference events. From 2000 through March of 2003, the business consisted solely of database management. From 2003 through April 2005, the business operations were derived totally from the Company’s wholly owned business, IP Service, ApS, a Danish IP security vulnerability company (“IP Service”). Since then, business operations have been solely derived from its wholly owned subsidiaries Anton Nielsen Vojens, ApS (“ANV”), Sharx Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Sharx DK ApS (collectively “Sharx”).   Lines of Business:   Advanced Oxygen Technologies, Inc. operations are derived from its wholly owned subsidiaries Anton Nielsen Vojens, ApS (“ANV”), Sharx Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Sharx DK ApS (collectively “Sharx”).   ANV is a Danish company that owns commercial real estate in Vojens, Denmark. ANV’s revenues are derived solely from the lease revenue from its real estate. Circle K Denmark A/S, formerly StatOil A/S, leases the facility from ANV. The lease expires in 2026.   Sharx Inc. is a Wyoming corporation incorporated in 2020 that owns Sharx DK ApS. Sharx Inc. operations are derived from its wholly owned subsidiary Sharx DK ApS. Sharx Inc. has no other operations and performs administrative functions for itself and its subsidiary.   Sharx DK ApS is a Danish company, incorporated in 2020. On June 30, 2020, Sharx DK ApS, entered into a Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution Agreement” Exhibit 10.1) with a third party vendor, Cleaver ApS, a Danish corporation (“Cleaver”), whereby Cleaver has appointed the Company as Cleaver’s nonexclusive distributor of its products in Europe, South America and North America. Cleaver is a manufacturer of a line of products for the logistics and cargo industry.  Sharx had no activity for the period ending December 31, 2022.    Other Risk and Uncertainties:   In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have implemented significant measures, including closures, quarantines, travel restrictions and other social distancing directives, intended to control the spread of the virus. Companies have also taken precautions, such as requiring employees to work remotely, imposing travel restrictions and temporarily closing businesses. To the extent that these restrictions remain in place, additional prevention and mitigation measures are implemented in the future, or there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of these or any other measures to contain or treat COVID-19, there is likely to be an adverse impact on global economic conditions and consumer confidence and spending, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s research and development, as well as operational activities. At this time, the Company is working to manage and mitigate potential disruptions to its future manufacturing and supply chain considerations. The Company has not experienced hindrance to its operations or material negative financial impacts as compared to prior periods. At this time, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company’s business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.   NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:   Principles of Consolidation:   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (ANV and Sharx), after elimination of all intercompany accounts, transactions, and profits.   Basis of Presentation:   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s fiscal year end is June 30.     8 Table of Contents    ADVANCED OXYGEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)   The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at the dates and for the periods presented have been included. The results of operations of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. All intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation.   Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted from these interim financial statements; these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Revenue Recognition:   Revenue from Contracts with Customers    For our rental revenue and commission revenue, we recognize revenue under the five steps in Topic 606, which are as follows: 1) identify the contract with the customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied.   Rental Revenue   Rental revenue is derived from the Commercial Property lease in which quarterly payments are received pursuant to the property lease which is in effect until 2026. We recognize revenue when we have satisfied a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or delivering a service to a client. We measure revenue based upon the consideration set forth in an arrangement or contract with a client. We recognize revenue from these services when the services are completed. If we are paid in advance for these services, we record such payment as a contract liability until we complete the services. As of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $ 2,992  of contract liabilities in connection to rental revenues.   The Company leases land to a customer. We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases when we believe substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line rent receivable, is probable of collection. For our leases, we receive a fixed payment from the customer which is recognized as lease income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease beginning with the adoption of ASC 842.   In April 2020, the FASB staff released guidance focused on treatment of concessions related to the effects of COVID-19 on the application of lease modification guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, “Leases.” The guidance provides a practical expedient to forgo the associated reassessments required by ASC 842 when changes to a lease result in similar or lower future consideration. We have elected to generally account for rent abatements as negative variable lease consideration in the period granted, or in the period we determine we expect to grant an abatement. Further abatements granted in the future will reduce lease income in the period we grant, or determine we expect to grant, an abatement. We have not agreed to any deferral or abatement arrangements with any of our customers.   The Company has elected to exclude short-term leases from the recognition requirements of ASC 842. A lease is short-term if, at the commencement date, it has a term of less than or equal to one year. Lease expense related to short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.   Commission revenue   For our commission revenue, we recognize revenue under the five steps in Topic 606, which are as follows: 1) identify the contract with the customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied.   The Company’s source of commission revenue is from the Company’s subsidiary Sharx in which quarterly payments are received when the customer pre-pays or pays upon the date products are drop shipped from the manufacturer pursuant to a non-exclusive distribution agreement. At such time the products are drop shipped, the Company’s performance obligation has been satisfied and revenue is recorded. The Company has determined that it is an agent of the manufacturer and collects commission revenue at or before the delivery of product (See Note 3 for further details).      9 Table of Contents   ADVANCED OXYGEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)   Cash and Cash Equivalents:   For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly-liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.   The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at December 31, 2022 did not exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes that it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on such amounts.   Property and Equipment:   Land is recognized at cost. Land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.   Foreign currency translation:   Foreign currency transactions are translated applying the current rate method. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates. Stockholders’ equity accounts are translated at the appropriate historical rates and revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average rates for the year.   Foreign currency transactions:   The Company applies the guidelines as set out in Section 830-20-35 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Section 830-20-35”) for foreign currency transactions. Pursuant to Section 830-20-35 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, foreign currency transactions are transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollar, the Company’s reporting currency. Foreign currency transactions may produce receivables or payables that are fixed in terms of the amount of foreign currency that will be received or paid. A change in exchange rates between the reporting currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected amount of reporting currency cash flows upon settlement of the transaction. That increase or decrease in expected reporting currency cash flows is a foreign currency transaction gain or loss that generally shall be included in determining net income for the period in which the exchange rate changes. Likewise, a transaction gain or loss (measured from the transaction date or the most recent intervening balance sheet date, whichever is later) realized upon settlement of a foreign currency transaction generally shall be included in determining net income for the period in which the transaction is settled. The exceptions to this requirement for inclusion in net income of transaction gains and losses pertain to certain intercompany transactions and to transactions that are designated as, and effective as, economic hedges of net investments and foreign currency commitments. Pursuant to Section 830-20-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the following shall apply to all foreign currency transactions of an enterprise and its investees: (a) at the date the transaction is recognized, each asset, liability, revenue, expense, gain, or loss arising from the transaction shall be measured and recorded in the functional currency of the recording entity by use of the exchange rate in effect at that date as defined in section 830-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification; and (b) at each balance sheet date, recorded balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency or reporting currency of the recording entity shall be adjusted to reflect the current exchange rate.   The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary ANV uses the Danish Krone, DKK as its reporting currency as well as its functional currency.   The wholly owned subsidiary Sharx DK ApS uses the US Dollar as its reporting currency as well as its functional currency and from time to time has transactions in foreign currencies. The change in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar, the Company’s reporting and functional currency and the foreign currency, the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected amount of reporting currency cash flows upon settlement of the transaction. That increase or decrease in expected reporting currency cash flows is a foreign currency transaction gain or loss that generally is included in determining net income (loss) for the period in which the exchange rate changes.      10 Table of Contents   ADVANCED OXYGEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)     Income Taxes:   The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is required when it is less likely than not that the Company will be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets. Because it is doubtful that the net operating losses of recent years will ever be used, a valuation allowance has been recognized equal to the tax benefit of net operating losses generated.   Earnings per Share:   Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.   As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021 there were
10,000
and
10,000 , potential dilutive shares that need to be considered as common share equivalents and because of the net loss, the effect of these potential common shares is anti-dilutive for the six-months ended December 31, 2022 and dilutive for six-months ended December 31, 2021. For the three-months ended December 31, 2022 and three-months December 31, 2021 the effect of these potential common shares is dilutive.     11 Table of Contents   ADVANCED OXYGEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)   Stock-Based Compensation:
The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued and are recognized over the employees required service period, which is generally the vesting period.   Concentrations of Credit Risk:   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to major credit risk consist principally of a single subsidiary of Anton Nielsen Vojens ApS. ANV’s rent revenues are derived from one customer. The Company’s commission revenues are subject to concentration risk as the commission revenues are derived from one product.   New Accounting Pronouncements Already Adopted   None.   New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted   None.   Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial statements.     12 Table of Contents   ADVANCED OXYGEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had a working capital deficit of $246,155 and $113,179 respectively. The change in cash is primarily due to currency translation. The decrease in the working capital deficit is primarily related to the operations of ANV.   Net cash provided by operating activities for six-month period ending December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $18,744 and $73,551, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the gain of the tax settlement.   Net cash used-in financing activities for six-month period ending December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $(13,285) and $(20,877) respectively. Net cash used in financing activities for both periods is related to the company’s borrowings from banks, officers and directors, and the repayment of debt.   OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS:   We do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements.   ACQUISITION EFFORTS:   The Company continues its efforts to raise capital to support operations and growth and is actively searching acquisition or merger with another company that would complement AOXY or increase its earnings potential. During this period, the Company has been in discussion with Companies looking to be acquired. AOXY has not negotiated any terms nor proposed any acquisitions of any of these companies that have been accepted. In addition, the Company is in discussion with potential lending institutions to assist in financing any proposed acquisition. The Company expects difficulty in financing the growth of the increased business or acquisition and has been concentrating on raising capital and/or obtaining a line of credit.     20 Table of Contents   ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk:   Smaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this Item.   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer who is also our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term “disclosure controls and procedures”, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer concluded as of December 31, 2022 that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at ensuring that the material information required to be disclosed in the Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as required in applicable SEC rules and the Company’s filed 10-K.   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
