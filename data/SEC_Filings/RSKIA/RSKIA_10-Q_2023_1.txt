The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. It is suggested that
these unaudited condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the
Company’s April 30, 2022 annual report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring

of the results for any other quarter or for the full year.
Accounting
Estimates

the carrying value of assets. The estimates and assumptions result in approximate rather than exact amounts.
Significant
Accounting Policies —
The significant accounting policies used in preparation of these condensed financial statements are disclosed
in our Annual Report, and there have been no changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the nine months ended

Investments
The
Company has investments in publicly traded equity securities, state and municipal debt securities, real estate investment trusts, and
money markets.
The investments in debt securities, which include municipal bonds and bond funds, mature between August 2023 and September
2042.
The Company uses the average cost method to determine the cost of equity securities sold with any unrealized gains or losses reported
in the respective period’s earnings. Unrealized gains and losses on debt securities are excluded from earnings and reported separately
as a component of stockholder’s equity. Dividend and interest income are reported as earned.
As
of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, investments consisted of the following:

Marketable
securities that are classified as equity securities are carried at fair value on the balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded
as an unrealized gain or (loss) in the statements of income in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of a marketable security,
the Company records a realized gain or (loss) on the Company’s statements of income.
The
Company evaluates all marketable securities for other-than-temporary declines in fair value, which are defined as when the cost basis
exceeds the fair value for approximately one year. The Company also evaluates the nature of the investment, cause of impairment and number
of investments that are in an unrealized position. When an “other-than-temporary” decline is identified, the Company will
decrease the cost of the marketable security to the new fair value and recognize a real loss. The investments are periodically evaluated
to determine if impairment changes are required. As a result of this standard, there were
no
impairment losses recorded for either of

Municipal
Bonds
The
unrealized losses on the Company’s investments in municipal bonds were caused by interest rate increases. The contractual terms
of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. Because
the Company has the ability to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider
these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022.
Marketable
Equity Securities and REITs
The
Company’s investments in marketable equity securities and REITs consist of a wide variety of companies. Investments in these companies
include growth, growth income, and foreign investment objectives. The individual holdings have been evaluated, and due to management’s
plan to hold on to these investments for an extended period, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily
impaired at January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022.

Retirement Benefit Plan
On
January 1, 1998, the Company adopted the George Risk Industries, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan is a
defined contribution savings plan designed to provide retirement income to eligible employees of the Company. The Plan is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. It is funded by voluntary pre-tax and Roth (taxable)
contributions from eligible employees who may contribute a percentage of their eligible compensation, limited and subject to statutory
limits.
Employees are eligible to participate in the Plan when they have attained the age of 21 and completed one thousand hours of service
in any plan year with the Company.
Upon leaving the Company, each participant is
100 % vested with respect to the participants’
contributions while the Company’s matching contributions are vested over a
six-year
period in accordance with the Plan document.
Contributions are invested, as directed by the participant, in investment funds available under the Plan. Matching contributions by the
Company of approximately $ 14,000
and $ 16,000
were paid during each quarter ending January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Likewise,
the Company paid matching contributions of approximately $ 43,000
and $ 48,000
during each nine-month period ending January 31, 2023 and
2022, respectively.
Note 7:
Fair Value Measurements
The
carrying value of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair value
due to their short-term nature. The fair value of our investments is determined utilizing market-based information. Fair value is the
price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at
fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and credit
risk.
US
GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The levels of the fair value hierarchy under US GAAP are described
below:
Level 1
Valuation is based upon quoted
prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
Level 2
Valuation is based upon quoted
prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active,
and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.
Level 3
Valuation is generated from
model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect our own
estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of
option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.
Investments
and Marketable Securities
As
of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, our investments consisted of money markets, publicly traded equity securities, real estate investment
trusts (REITs) as well as certain state and municipal debt securities. Our marketable securities are valued using third-party broker
statements. The value of the investments is derived from quoted market information. The inputs to the valuation are generally classified
as Level 1 given the active market for these securities, however, if an active market does not exist, which is the case for municipal
bonds and REITs, the inputs are recorded as Level 2.
Fair
Value Hierarchy
The
following tables set forth our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and a non-recurring basis by level
within the fair value hierarchy. As required by US GAAP, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest
level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

MANAGEMENT
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the Securities Act) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), which are subject
to the “safe harbor” created by those sections. Any statements herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed
to be forward-looking statements. For example, words such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “would,”
“should,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,”
“project” or “continue,” and the negatives of such terms are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
The information included herein represents our estimates and assumptions as of the date of this filing. Unless required by law, we undertake
no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from
those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.
The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed financial statements, and with the Company’s
audited financial statements and discussion for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022.
Executive
Summary
The
Company’s performance in operations stayed consistent through the three quarters of the current fiscal year with the third quarter
dipping slightly in sales over the second quarter of the current fiscal year. This is mainly due the fact that our business is tied to
the housing market and the winter months usually show a slowdown and the colder and snowier than normal weather has been keeping employees
away from our locations at times. Opportunities include keeping up with the business growth and finding ways to get our products out
to our customers in a timelier manner. One way we are doing this is by looking into more automation. We also continue to look at businesses
that might be a good fit to purchase. We also have new products that are scheduled to be introduced by the end of the fiscal year. Challenges
in the coming months include continuing to get product out to customers in a timely manner and dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions
and inflation. Possible COVID-19 challenges include, but are not limited to, price increases and/or delays in the supply chain, reduced
sales, workforce interruptions, and economic conditions impacting the stock market. Management continues to work at keeping operations
flowing as efficiently as possible with the hopes of getting the facilities running leaner and more profitable than ever before.
Results
of Operations
● Net
sales were $4,366,000 for the quarter ended January 31, 2023, which is a 13.61% decrease
from the corresponding quarter last year. Year-to-date net sales were $15,194,000 at January
31, 2023, which is a 0.38% decrease from the same period last year. The slight reduction
in sales is due to our general winter and holiday slowdown and there has been more winter
weather than normal. But we continue to operate our business with our ongoing commitment
to outstanding customer service and our ability to customize products.
● Cost
of goods sold was 55.98% of net sales for the quarter ended January 31, 2023 and was 56.61%
for the same quarter last year. Year-to-date cost of goods sold percentages were 53.15% for
the current nine months and 51.85% for the corresponding nine months last year. The current
cost of goods sold percentages are right outside of Management’s goal of keeping labor
and other manufacturing expenses at less than 50% for both the quarter and year-to-date results.
Management continues to work with and train employees to work more efficiently. Raw material
prices have soared over the current fiscal year because of inflation and wages have had to
be raised to remain competitive in the job market. Management offset some of these added
expenses by implementing a 10% price increase effective January 1, 2023.
18
● Operating
expenses decreased by $27,000 for the quarter and they decreased by $6,000 for the nine-months
ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the corresponding periods last year. When comparing
percentages in relation to net sales, the operating expenses for the quarter ended January
31, 2023 was 23.41% of net sales while it was 20.76% of net sales for the same quarter the
prior year. For year-to-date numbers, operating expense were 21.32% and 21.28% of net sales
for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company has been able
to keep the operating expenses at less than 30% of net sales for many years now; however,
the actual dollar amount increase is due to increased commission amounts, related to increased
sales, and additional labor costs related wage increases.
● Income
from operations for the quarter ended January 31, 2023 was $900,000, a 21.33% decrease from
the corresponding quarter last year, which had income from operations of $1,144,000. Income
from operations for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 was $3,878,000, which is a 5.37%
decrease from the corresponding nine months last year, which had income from operations of
$4,098,000.
● Other
income and expenses for the quarter ended January 31, 2023 shows income of $1,775,000, which
is a $2,860,000 increase from the from the corresponding quarter last year, which had an
expense amount of $1,085,000. Comparatively, there is an increase of $144,000 in other income
for the year-to-date numbers. Most of the activity in these accounts consists of investment
interest, dividends, real gains or losses on sale of investments, and unrealized gains or
losses on equity securities. The main reason for the increase in the current quarter and
year-to-date numbers is unrealized gain and loss on equity securities. The Company is at
the mercy of the stock market when it comes to these figures and market has seen a recovery
since the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic factors.
● Overall,
net income for the quarter ended January 31, 2023 was up $1,848,000, or 1147.83%, from the
same quarter last year. Similarly, net income for the nine-month period ended January 31,
2023 was up $72,000, or 2%, from the same period in the prior year.
● Earnings
per common share for quarter ended January 31, 2023 were $0.41 per share and $0.74 per share
for the year-to-date numbers. EPS for the quarter and nine months ended January 31, 2022
were $0.03 per share and $0.73 per share, respectively.
Liquidity
and capital resources
Operating
● Net
cash decreased $813,000 during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to a decrease
of $938,000 during the corresponding period last year.
19
● Accounts
receivable decreased $824,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared with a
$91,000 decrease for the same period last year. The current year decrease is a result of
a slight decline in sales and slower collections of accounts receivable. An analysis of accounts
receivable shows that there were 7.02% that were over 90 days at January 31, 2023.
● Inventories
increased $2,444,000 during the current nine-month period compared to an increase of $1,465,000
last year. The larger increase in the current year is due to increases in the cost of raw
materials and having more raw materials on hand to not run into shortages like what has happened
recently.
● Prepaid
expenses saw a $458,000 decrease for the current nine months, primarily due to having inventory
and machinery delivered during the current nine-month period; therefore, having less money
in prepayments of raw materials on the books. The prior nine months showed a $1,089,000 increase
in prepaid expenses.
● Income
tax overpayment increased $478,000 for the current nine-month period, compared to having
a decrease of $163,000 in income tax payable for the nine-months ended January 31, 2022.
The current increase is due to having to pay additional income tax that was due for the prior
fiscal year during the current period.
● Accounts
payable shows an $84,000 increase for the current nine-month period ended January 31, 2023
compared to a $176,000 decrease for the prior nine-month period. The company strives to pay
all invoices within terms, and the variance in increases is primarily due to the timing of
receipt of products and payment of invoices.
● Accrued
expenses increased $184,000 for the current nine-month period compared to a $130,000 increase
for the nine-month period ended January 31, 2022. The difference in the amounts is primarily
due to increased wages.
Investing
● As
for our investment activities, the Company spent approximately $221,000 on acquisitions of
property and equipment for the current nine-month period, in comparison with the corresponding
nine months last year, where there was activity of $164,000.
● Additionally,
the Company continues to purchase marketable securities, which include municipal bonds and
quality stocks. During the nine-month period ended January 31, 2023 the buy/sell activity
in the investment accounts was continued as usual. Net cash spent on purchases of marketable
securities for the nine-month period ended January 31, 2023 was $648,000 compared to $640,000
spent in the prior nine-month period. The Company continues to use “money manager”
accounts for most stock transactions. By doing this, the Company gives an independent third-party
firm, who are experts in this field, permission to buy and sell stocks at will. The Company
pays a quarterly service fee based on the value of the investments.
Financing
● The
Company continues to purchase back common stock when the opportunity arises. For the nine-month
period ended January 31, 2023, the Company purchased $5,000 worth of treasury stock. This
is in comparison to $35,000 spent in the same nine months period the prior year.
20
● The
company paid out dividends of $2,689,000 during the nine months ending January 31, 2023.
These dividends were paid during the second quarter. The company declared a dividend of $0.60
per share of common stock on September 30, 2022 and these dividends were paid by October
31, 2022. As for the prior year numbers, dividends paid was $2,256,000 for the nine months
ending January 31, 2022. A dividend of $0.50 per common share was declared and paid during
the second fiscal quarter last year.

Product Development
The
Company and its engineering department continue to develop enhancements to product lines, develop new products which complement existing
products, and look for products that are well suited to our distribution network and manufacturing capabilities. Items currently in the
development process include:
● Explosion
proof contacts that will be UL listed for hazardous locations. There has been demand from
our customers for this type of high security magnetic reed switch.
● The
Company is developing magnetic contacts which are listed under UL 634 Level 2. These sensors
are for high security applications such as government buildings, military use, nuclear facilities,
and financial institutions.
● Wireless
technology is a main area of focus for product development. We are considering adding wireless
technology to some of our current products. A wireless contact switch is in the final stages
of development. Also, we are working on wireless versions of monitoring devices which include
glass break detection, tilt sensing and environmental monitoring. A redesign of our brass
water valve shut-off system is near completion.
Other
Information
In
addition to researching and developing new products, management is always open to the possibility of acquiring a business or product
line that would complement our existing operations. Due to the Company’s strong cash position, management believes this could be
achieved without the need for outside financing. The intent is to utilize the equipment, marketing techniques and established customers
to deliver new products and increase sales and profits.
There
are no known seasonal trends with any of GRI’s products since we sell to distributors and OEM manufacturers. Our products are tied
to the housing industry and will fluctuate with building trends.

4. Controls and Procedures
Our
management, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer (also working as our chief financial officer),
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of January 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the disclosure controls
and procedures employed at the Company were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
In
our annual report filed on Report 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022, management identified the following material weakness in our
internal control over financial reporting:
● The
small size of our Company limits our ability to achieve the desired level of separation of
duties for proper internal controls and financial reporting, particularly as it relates to
financial reporting to assure material disclosures or implementation of newly issued accounting
standards are included. A secondary review over annual and quarterly filings does occur with
an outside party. Due to the departure of the Controller, the current CEO and CFO roles are
being fulfilled by the same individual. We do not have an audit committee. We do not believe
we have met the full requirement for separation of duties for financial reporting purposes.
We
continue to operate with a limited number of accounting and financial personnel. For the quarter ending January 31, 2023, the Company
did not have a Controller, but management is looking to fill this position as soon as possible. Training will be required to fulfill
disclosure control and procedure responsibilities, including review procedures for key accounting schedules and timely and proper documentation
of material transactions and agreements. Until sufficient training has taken place for this new Controller, we believe this control deficiency
represents material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. To mitigate the effects of the material weakness identified
in our annual report, the Company contracted with an outside CPA to perform a secondary review of our quarterly report filed on Form
10-Q.
Despite
the material weaknesses in financial reporting noted above, we believe that our condensed financial statements included in this
report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in all
material respects.
We
are committed to the establishment of effective internal controls over financial reporting and will place emphasis on quarterly and year-end
closing procedures, timely documentation, and internal review of accounting and financial reporting consequences of material contracts
and agreements, and enhanced review of all schedules and account analyses by experienced accounting department personnel or independent
consultants.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Other
than those mentioned above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended January
31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
