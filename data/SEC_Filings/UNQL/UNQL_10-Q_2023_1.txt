Liquidity
The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. Substantial doubt about an entity’s
ability to continue as a going concern exists when conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that
the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are
issued.
As
of November 30, 2022, the Company reported working capital of approximately $ 8.5
million compared with $ 4.2
million working capital as of May 31, 2022. The
Company has adequate cash availability through the TBK Facility.
Since
its inception, the Company has experienced significant business growth. To fund such growth, operating capital was initially provided
by third party investors through the sale of Convertible Notes which were subsequently exchanged into convertible securities. Preferred
shares are more beneficial to the Company because they do not require cash repayments. Due to the antidilution provision embedded in certain of the convertible securities, these provisions resulted in an embedded derivative and the Company recorded a long-term liability.
As of the quarter ended November 30, 2022, and the year ended May 31, 2022, this liability was $ 11.7
million and $ 12.4
million, respectively.
This liability is recorded as a long-term liability due to its future settlement in common stock on the balance sheet and is being adjusted
to market on each of the subsequent reporting periods.
To fund the pending acquisitions, as discussed in Note 6: Commitments and
Contingencies, on December 18, 2022, the Company has entered into a commitment from a lender for a senior secured financing facility that
will provide the necessary debt capital to execute the acquisitions.

While
we continue to execute our strategic plan, management is focused on managing cash and monitoring our liquidity position. We have implemented
a number of initiatives to conserve our liquidity position including activities such as increasing credit facilities, when needed, reducing
cost of debt, controlling general and administrative expenditures and improving collection processes. Many of the aspects of the plan
involve management’s judgments and estimates that include factors that could be beyond our control and actual results could differ
from our estimates. These and other factors could cause the strategic plan to be unsuccessful which could have a material adverse effect
on our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity. Use of operating cash is an indicator that there could be a going concern
issue, but based on our evaluation of the Company’s projected cash flows and business performance as of and subsequent to the balance
sheet date, management has concluded that the Company’s current cash and cash availability under the TBK Facility as of November
30, 2022, would be sufficient to fund its planned operations for at least one year from the date these consolidated financial statements
are issued.
COVID-19
Covid-19
remains a threat and certain countries, such as China, are still subject to restrictions related to Covid-19. While the threat level
has declined to a significant extent in the USA and globally, any resurgence could have a material adverse effect on our business operations,
results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
Basis
of Presentation
The
condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The
unaudited interim financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring items, which
in the opinion of management are necessary to fairly state the financial position of the Company and the results of its operations for
the periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto included in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2022. The Company assumes that the users of the interim
financial information herein have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year and that the
adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. The condensed consolidated balance
sheet on May 31, 2022 was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries stated in U.S.
dollars, the Company’s functional currency. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidated
financial statements.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant
estimates inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include determinations of the useful lives and expected
future cash flows of long-lived assets, including intangibles, valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations,
and estimates and assumptions in valuation of debt and equity instruments, including derivative liabilities. In addition, the Company
makes significant judgments to recognize revenue – see policy note “ Revenue Recognition ” below.
F- 6
Fair
Value Measurement
The
Company follows the authoritative guidance that establishes a formal framework for measuring fair values of assets and liabilities in
the consolidated financial statements that are already required by generally accepted accounting principles to be measured at fair value.
The guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The transaction is based on a hypothetical transaction in the principal
or most advantageous market considered from the perspective of the market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability.
The
Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants who are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact
would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. The Company attempts to utilize valuation techniques
that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
The
Company is able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. The guidance establishes a formal fair value
hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 measurements and the lowest
priority to level 3 measurements, and accordingly, Level 1 measurement should be used whenever possible.
The
hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:
Level
1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities or published net asset value for alternative investments
with characteristics similar to a mutual fund.
Level
2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly.
Level
3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The
methods used may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
Furthermore, while management believes its valuation methods are appropriate, the fair value of certain financial instruments could result
in a difference fair value measurement at the reporting date. There were no changes in the Company’s valuation methodologies from
the prior year.
For
purpose of this disclosure, the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a
current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation. The carrying amounts for financial assets
and liabilities such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable - trade, contract assets, factoring reserve, other prepaid
expenses and current assets, accounts payable – trade and other current liabilities, including contract liabilities,
convertible notes, promissory notes, all approximate fair value due to their short-term nature as of November 30, 2022 and May 31,
2022. The carrying amount of the long-term debt approximates fair value because the interest rates on these instruments approximate
the interest rate on debt with similar terms available to the Company. Lease liabilities approximate fair value based on the
incremental borrowing rate used to discount future cash flows. The Company had Level 3 liabilities (See Derivative liabilities note)
as of November 30, 2022. On November 30, 2021, Level 3 derivative liability balances were insignificant. There were no
transfers between levels during the reporting period.
Accounts
Receivable
Accounts
receivable from revenue transactions are based on invoiced prices which the Company expects to collect. In the normal course of business,
the Company extends credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria. The Company generally does not require collateral to
support customer receivables. Accounts receivable, as shown on the consolidated balance sheets, is net of allowances when applicable.
An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the consolidated
financial statements, assessments of collectability based on an evaluation of historic and anticipated trends, the financial condition
of the Company’s customers, and an evaluation of the impact of economic conditions. The maximum accounting loss from the credit
risk associated with accounts receivable is the amount of the receivable recorded, net of allowance for doubtful accounts. As of November
30, 2022 and May 31, 2022, the Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $ 2.7
million.
F- 7
Concentrations
Three
major customers represented approximately
21.0 %
of all accounts receivable as of November 30, 2022 and no single customer represented more than
10.0 %
of total accounts receivable. Revenue from these three major customers as a percentage of the Company’s total revenue was
20.0 %
and
21.0 % for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022, respectively, and no single customer represented more than
10.0 %
of total revenue.
Three
major customers represented approximately

72.0 %
and
56 % of total revenue for the three and six months ended November 30, 2021 with only customer A at
54 %
and 40% respectively, and customers B and C were less than
10.0 %
each for the three and six months ended November 30, 2021.
Derivative
Liability
On
December 10, 2021, the Company entered into an amended securities exchange agreement with the holders of convertible notes to exchange
all Convertible Notes of the Company into shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock Series C and D.
Similar
to the existing Convertible Preferred Stock Series A, these preferred stocks featured anti-dilution provision that expire on a specified
date. Management has determined the anti-dilution provision embedded in preferred stock Series A, C and D is required to be accounted
for separately from the preferred stock as a derivative liability and recorded at fair value. Separation of the anti-dilution option
as a derivative liability is required because its economic characteristics are considered more akin to an equity instrument and therefore
the anti-dilution option is not considered to be clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the preferred stock.
The
Company has identified and recorded derivative instruments arising from an anti-dilution provision in the Company’s Series A, C
and D Preferred Stock. An embedded derivative liability is representing the rights of holders of Convertible Preferred Stock Series A,
C and D to receive additional common stock of the Company upon issuance of any additional common stock by the Company prior to qualified
financing event as defined in the agreement. Each reporting period, the embedded derivative liability, if material, would be adjusted
to reflect fair value at each period end with changes in fair value recorded in the “Change in fair value of embedded derivative
liability” financial statement line item of the company’s statements of operations. During the three months ended November
30, 2022, the Company recorded a change in fair value of $ 0.7
million in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

The
underlying value of the anti-dilution provision is calculated from estimating the probability and value of the provision assuming a near
term financing event. For the period ended May 31, 2022, the model used estimates the potential that the company completes a capital
raise prior to the expiration of the anti-dilution feature and determines the value of the anti-dilution feature given these assumptions.
The model required the use of certain assumptions. These assumptions include probability a raise is completed, probability certain anti-dilution
features are extended, estimated raise amount, term to a raise, and an appropriate risk-free interest rate. For the period ended November
30, 2022, due to changes in the way antidilutive shares of Convertible Preferred Series A, C and D would be exchanged in the near future
for common stock, and the fact that the antidilution provision of these shares was extended through March 31, 2023, the assumptions were
changed to include probability of the financing event, estimated value of common stock at the exchange point and estimated time to financing
event.

Revenue
Recognition
The
Company adopted ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when control of the promised
goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to
receive in exchange for services. The Company recognizes revenue upon meeting each performance obligation based on the allocated amount
of the total consideration of the contract to each specific performance obligation.
To
determine revenue recognition, the Company applies the following five steps:
1.
Identify
the contract(s) with a customer;
2.
Identify
the performance obligations in the contract;
3.
Determine
the transaction price;
4.
Allocate
the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
5.
Recognize
revenue as or when the performance obligation is satisfied.
Revenue
is recognized as follows:
i.
Freight
income - export sales
Freight
income from the provision of air, ocean, and land freight forwarding services are recognized over time based on a relative transit
time basis thru the sail or departure from origin port. The Company is the principal in these transactions and recognizes revenue
on a gross basis.
ii.
Freight
income - import sales
Freight
income from the provision of air, ocean, and land freight forwarding services are recognized over time based on a relative transit
time basis thru the delivery to the customer’s designated location. The Company is the principal in these transactions and
recognizes revenue on a gross basis.
iii.
Customs
brokerage and other service income
Customs
brokerage and other service income from the provision of other services are recognized at the point in time the performance obligation
is met.
F- 9
The
Company’s business practices require, for accurate and meaningful disclosure, that it recognizes revenue over time. The “over
time” policy is the period from point of origin to arrival of the shipment at US Port of entry (or in the case when the customer
requires delivery to a designated point, the arrival at that delivery point). This over time policy requires the Company to make significant
judgements to recognize revenue over the estimated duration of time from port of origin to arrival at port of entry. The point in the
process when the Company meets its obligation in the port of entry and the subsequent transfer of the goods to the customer is when the
customer has the obligation to pay, has taken physical possession, has legal title, risk and awards (ownership) and has accepted the
goods. The Company has elected to not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that
are unsatisfied as of the end of the period as the Company’s contracts with its customers have an expected duration of one year
or less.
The
Company uses independent contractors and third-party carriers in the performance of its transportation services. The Company evaluates
who controls the transportation services to determine whether its performance obligation is to transfer services to the customer or to
arrange for services to be provided by another party. The Company determined it acts as the principal for its transportation services
performance obligation since it is in control of establishing the prices for the specified services, managing all aspects of the shipments
process and assuming the risk of loss for delivery and collection.
Revenue
billed prior to realization is recorded as contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and contract costs incurred prior
to revenue recognition are recorded as contract assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
Contract
Assets
Contract
assets represent amounts for which the Company has the right to consideration for the services provided while a shipment is still in-transit
but for which it has not yet completed the performance obligation and has not yet invoiced the customer. Upon completion of the performance
obligations, which can vary in duration based upon the method of transport and billing the customer, these amounts become classified
within accounts receivable.
Contract
Liabilities
Contract
liabilities represent the amount of obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which consideration has been received.

Segment
Reporting
Based
on the guidance provided by ASC Topic 280,
Segment Reporting , management has determined that the Company currently operates in
one geographical segment and consists of a single reporting unit given the similarities in economic characteristics between its operations
and the common nature of its products, services and customers.
Earnings
per Share
The
Company adopted ASC 260,
Earnings per share,
guidance from the inception. Earnings per share (“EPS”) is the amount
of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience, the term is used to refer to either earnings or loss per share.
Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding, including warrants exercisable for less than a penny, (the denominator) during the period. Income available to common stockholders
shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated
for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in
the consolidated statements of operations) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of
basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding
if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common
shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options or warrants.
The
following table provides a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in computing basic and diluted net income attributable
to common stockholders per common share.

Leases
The
Company recognizes a right of use (“ROU”) asset and liability in the consolidated balance sheet primarily related to its
operating leases of office space, warehouse space and equipment. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying
asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
All ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date at the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
ROU assets are adjusted for lease incentives and initial direct costs. The lease term includes renewal options exercisable at the Company’s
sole discretion when the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. As the Company’s leases generally do not have an
implicit rate, the Company uses an estimated incremental borrowing rate based on borrowing rates available to them at the commencement
date to determine the present value. Certain of our leases include variable payments, which may vary based upon changes in facts or circumstances
after the start of the lease. The Company excludes variable payments from ROU assets and lease liabilities to the extent not considered
fixed, and instead expenses variable payments as incurred. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and
is included in rent and occupancy expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Pending
acquisitions
On
April 28, 2022, Unique Logistics International, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Purchase
Agreement”), by and between the Company and Unique Logistics Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong corporation (the “Seller”),
whereby the Company acquired from the Seller all of Seller’s share capital (the “Purchased Shares”) in nine (9) of
Seller’s subsidiaries (collectively the “Subsidiaries”) as listed in Schedule I of the Purchase Agreement. As consideration
for the Purchased Shares, the Company agreed to (i) pay the Seller $ 21,000,000
(the “Cash Consideration”); and (ii) issue
to the Seller a $ 1,000,000
promissory note (the “Note” and, together with the Cash Consideration, the “Purchase Price”).
The Purchase Price is subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Purchase Agreement.
The
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement shall be contingent upon and subject to successful Financing and shell be completed
prior to February 15, 2023. If the Company is unable to obtain the Financing, the Company may provide written notice to Seller stating
that the Company has been unable to obtain the Financing and notify Seller that the Company has elected to either (i) waive the condition
of the Financing, in which event the Purchase Agreement will continue as if the Financing had been obtained or (ii) terminate the Purchase
Agreement.
Litigation
From
time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of the business. There
are no claims or actions pending or threatened against the Company that, if adversely determined, would in the Company’s management’s
judgment have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Leases
The
Company leases office space, warehouse facilities and equipment under non-cancellable lease agreements expiring on various dates through
October 2028. Office leases contain provisions for future rent increases. The Company adopted ASC 842 from inception, requiring the Company
to recognize an asset and liability on the consolidated balance sheets for lease arrangements with terms longer than 12 months. The Company
has elected the practical expedient to not apply the recognition requirement to leases with a term of less than one year (short term
leases). The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments to present value. The incremental borrowing rate
is based on the estimated interest rate the Company could obtain for borrowing over a similar term of the lease at commencement date.
Rental escalations, renewal options and termination options, when applicable, have been factored into the Company’s determination
of lease payments when appropriate. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts. Variable payments related
to pass-through costs for maintenance, taxes and insurance or adjustments based on an index such as Consumer Price Index are not included
in the measurement of the lease liability or asset and are expensed as incurred.
The
components of lease expense were as follows:

5 years
and
3 years , respectively. The discount rate used to account for new leases was approximately

%. The Company assessed the
renewal options as a part of the adoption of ASC 842, if the renewal options were determined to be reasonably assured/certain at inception
they would be appropriately captured within the future minimum lease payment schedule within the footnote of the Company’s financial
statement and included in the ROU Asset and ROU liability upon transition.

In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future generation
for taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible.
Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies
in making this assessment. For the three or six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, there was
no
valuation allowance necessary.
The
Company evaluated the provisions of ASC 740 related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s
financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, present, and disclose uncertain positions
that the Company has taken or expects to take in its tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not
to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return
and the net benefit recognized and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as “unrecognized benefits.” A
liability is recognized (or amount of net operating loss carry forward or amount of tax refundable is reduced) for unrecognized tax benefit
because it represents an enterprise’s potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized
as a result of applying the provisions of ASC 740.
If
applicable, interest costs related to the unrecognized tax benefits are required to be calculated and would be classified as “Other
expenses – Interest” in the statement of operations. Penalties would be recognized as a component of “General and administrative.”
No
interest or penalties on unpaid tax were recorded during the three months ended November 30, 2022 and no liability for unrecognized tax
benefits was required to be reported. The Company does not expect any significant changes in its unrecognized tax benefits in the next
year.
The

Act”) that reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
These
statements are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the Company’s management as well as estimates and
assumptions made by the Company’s management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,

those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned.
Although
the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future
results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the
United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.
Our

These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments

and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of
the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial
statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. The following discussion
should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. The forward-looking
statements made in this report are based only on events or information as of the date on which the statements are made in this report.
Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result
of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated
events. You should read this report and the documents we refer to in this report and have filed as exhibits to this report completely
and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. These risks include, by way

Market
and Business Trends
The
current fiscal year 2023 that commenced June 1, 2022 can be considered the Company’s first fiscal year in the post Covid period.
The impact of Covid in the previous two fiscal years resulted in an initial drop in shipping volumes and then the post Covid surge in
shipping volumes including all related logistics challenges.
As
we report the current quarter and six months ended November 30, 2022, it is pertinent to compare our business base and the emerging trends
with the equivalent periods from 2019 before Covid impacted the logistics industry. The equivalent period in 2019 was prior to the acquisitions
in May 2020 and the comparisons are based on the aggregation of the three operating companies prior to the acquisition in May 2020. The
Company’s 25 largest customers based on revenue during the period ended November 30, 2022, include 12 customers that were added
after the acquisition in May 2020. In addition, the Company still retains 23 of the customers that were in the top 25 in 2019. Thus,
the Company, today, has a significantly expanded customer base besides substantially retaining virtually all its legacy customers.
In
terms of volume, the Company’s top 25 customers, today, ship more containers (94%) and more air freight weight (15%) compared with
the top 25 customers in 2019. An identifiable trend in the market in the current period, versus 2019, is a significant shift in shipping
from air to ocean. The Company expects air freight volumes to increase in the course of 2023.
Overall,
the Company is well positioned to grow its business in the post Covid era as it continues to build its customer base, increases profitability,
and makes strategic plans for organic growth and through the targeted acquisitions. We are expanding our sales organization, locking in procurement strategies
and receiving positive feedback from our existing customers regarding their future shipping needs.

Total
revenue declined by 78% driven by a slowdown in shipping and pricing decline in both air and sea. Air freight revenue declined 92% compared
with the same period last year due to 85% lower shipped volume and 40% lower sell rates. Ocean freight revenue declined 58% compared
with the same period last year due to 46% lower shipped volume and 23% lower sell rates. The Company continues to invest in its sales
and marketing strategy to increase market share, while seeking opportunities for strategic acquisitions to grow our business.
Product
costs and Operating Expenses
Product
costs and operating expenses in total were $83.8 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared with $ 396.8
million for the three months ended November 30, 2021. Reduction of 79% in the total product costs and operating expenses was primarily
attributable to reduction in shipping volumes in our air and ocean product divisions. Air freight cost was lower by 93% and Ocean freight
was lower by 63% when compared with the same period last year. Further reduction in operating expenses was due to reduction in sales
commissions by 83% which was partially offset by 30% increases in salaries and benefits due to higher professional staff count and 123%
increase in professional fees related to pending acquisitions.
Other
Income (Expenses)
Other
expenses comprised of interest expense, gain on forgiveness of promissory notes, amortization of debt discount and gain on extinguishment
of convertible debt and change in fair value of derivative liabilities.
During
the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, interest expense and bank fees totaled approximately $0.9 million and $1.9 million,
respectively. This reduction is primarily due to reduced amount of borrowing on the operating line of credit due to lower shipping volume
and decline in buy rates. During the same period, the Company also recorded approximately $0.1 million gain in fair value of derivative
liabilities
associated with the antidilution provision imbedded in Series A, C and D Preferred
Stocks. None was recorded during the three-month ended November 30, 2021.

Total
revenue declined by 62% driven by a slowdown in shipping and pricing decline in both air and sea. Air freight revenue declined 84% compared
with the same period last year due to 79% lower shipped volume and 11% lower sell rates. Ocean freight revenue declined 43% compared
with the same period last year due to 47% lower shipped volume with approximately unchanged sell rates. The Company continues to invest
in its sales and marketing strategy to increase market share, while seeking opportunities for strategic acquisitions to grow our business.
Costs
and Operating Expenses
Product
costs and operating expenses were $215.5 million for the Six months ended November 30, 2022, compared with $ 583.3
million for the Six months ended November 30, 2021. Reduction of 63% in the total product costs and operating expenses was primarily
attributable to reduction in shipping volumes in our air and ocean product divisions. Air freight cost was lower by 85% and Ocean freight
was lower by 45% when compared with the same period last year. Further reduction in operating expenses was due to reduction in sales
commissions by 85% which was partially offset by 25% increases in salaries and benefits due to higher professional staff count and 146%
increase in professional fees related to pending acquisitions.
Other
Income (Expense)
Other
expenses comprised of interest expense, gain on forgiveness of promissory notes, amortization of debt discount and gain on extinguishment
of convertible debt and change in fair value of derivative liabilities.
During
the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, interest expense and bank fees totaled approximately $2.3 million and $3.2 million,
respectively. This reduction is primarily due to reduced amount of borrowing on the operating line of credit due to lower shipping volume
and decline in buy rates during the period ended November 30, 2022. During the same period, the Company also recorded approximately $0.7
million gain in fair value of derivative liabilities
associated with the antidilution provision
imbedded in Series A, C and D Preferred Stocks.
For
the period ended November 30, 2021, there was no adjustments recorded in the value of a derivative liability, and t he
Company recorded approximately $0.8 million amortization of debt discount related to the convertible notes outstanding at that time and
approximately $0.8 million gain on extinguishment of debt related to the same notes. In addition, during the six months ended November
30, 2021, the Company was granted forgiveness of the Paycheck Protection Program loans under the CARES Act, (the “PPP Loan”)
and recorded a gain on forgiveness of approximately $358,000.

Net
Income
Net
income was approximately $6.6 million for the six months ended November 30, 2022, compared to a net income of approximately $6.5 million
for the six months ended November 30, 2021.
Adjusted
EBITDA
We
define adjusted EBITDA to be earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, factoring fees, other income, net, stock-based
compensation and expenses, merger and acquisition costs, restructuring, transition and acquisitions expense, net, goodwill impairment
and certain other items.
Adjusted
EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
companies. We present adjusted EBITDA because we believe that adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplement to net income from operations as
an indicator of operating performance. We use adjusted EBITDA as a financial metric to measure the financial performance of the business
because management believes it provides additional information with respect to the performance of its fundamental business activities.
For this reason, we believe adjusted EBITDA will also be useful to others, including our stockholders, as a valuable financial metric.
We
believe that adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure and not a liquidity measure, and therefore a reconciliation between net income
from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA has been provided in the financial results. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as
an alternative to income from operations or net income from operations as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows
from operating activities as an indicator of cash flows, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity.
In addition, adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes
that can affect cash flows. We do not intend the presentation of these non-GAAP measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Following
is the reconciliation of our consolidated net income to adjusted EBITDA:

Liquidity
and Capital Resources
The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. Substantial doubt about an entity’s
ability to continue as a going concern exists when conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that
the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are
issued.
As
of November 30, 2022, the Company reported working capital of approximately $8.5 million compared with $4.2 million working capital as
of May 31, 2022. The Company’s Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) contribution
to working capital was $5.2 million and $10.2 million during the three and six months ended November 30, 2022. The Company has adequate
cash availability through the TBK Facility.
Since
its inception, the Company has experienced significant business growth. To fund such growth, operating capital was initially provided
by third party investors through the sale of Convertible Notes which were subsequently exchanged into convertible securities. Preferred
shares are more beneficial to the Company because they do not require cash repayments. Due to the antidilution provision imbedded in
the certain of the convertible securities, these provisions resulted in an embedded derivative and the Company recorded a long-term liability.
As of the quarter ended November 30, 2022, and the year ended May 31, 2022, this liability was $11.7 million and $12.4 million, respectively.
This liability is recorded as a long-term liability due to its future settlement in common stock on the balance sheet and is being adjusted
to market on each of the subsequent reporting periods.
To fund the pending acquisitions, as discussed in Note 6: Commitments and
Contingencies, on December 18, 2022, the Company has entered into a commitment from a lender for a senior secured financing facility that
will provide the necessary debt capital to execute the acquisitions.
While
we continue to execute our strategic plan, management is focused on managing cash and monitoring our liquidity position. We have implemented
a number of initiatives to conserve our liquidity position including activities such as increasing credit facilities, when needed, reducing
cost of debt, controlling general and administrative expenditures and improving collection processes. Many of the aspects of the plan
involve management’s judgments and estimates that include factors that could be beyond our control and actual results could differ
from our estimates. These and other factors could cause the strategic plan to be unsuccessful which could have a material adverse effect
on our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity. Use of operating cash is an indicator that there could be a going concern
issue, but based on our evaluation of the Company’s projected cash flows and business performance as of and subsequent to the balance
sheet date, management has concluded that the Company’s current cash and cash availability under the TBK Facility as of November
30, 2022, would be sufficient to fund its planned operations for at least one year from the date these consolidated financial statements
are issued.

The
change in working capital is primarily attributable a decrease in accounts receivable of about $23.4 million, a decrease in contract
assets of $17.2 million offset by an increase in ROU assets $8.9 million, offset by a decrease in accounts payable of about $18.1 million, a decrease of accrued freight of about
$8.0 million and decrease in the borrowed amount on the line of credit by $17.4 million offset by a lease liability of $8.9 incurred due to signing of new leases

Operating
activities provided cash of $17.9 million for the six months ended November 30, 2022, compared to net cash used by operations of $30.4
million for the six months ended November 30, 2021. Primary reason for cash provided during the six months ended November 30, 2022, was
the collections on accounts receivables offset by reduction in Accounts Payable and Accrued Freight.
Primary
reason for cash used
for the six months ended November 30, 2022 , was a significant increase
in accounts receivables, reflecting repurchase of trade receivables from a factor taking advantage of a better interest rate on Company’s
new revolving credit facility.
Cash
used by financing activities of $18 million for the six months ended November 30, 2022, primarily for repayment of $17.4 million to the
line of credit. During for the six months ended November 30, 2021,
financing activities provided
cash of $31.0 million due to initial borrowing of $29.8 million from the line of credit facility in effect from June 1, 2021, used to
repurchase factored trade receivables.
Critical
Accounting Policies
Accounting
policies, methods and estimates are an integral part of the condensed consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are
based upon management’s current judgments. These judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience regarding past and current
events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting policies, methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of
their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from management’s
current judgments. While there are a number of accounting policies, methods and estimates that affect our condensed consolidated financial
statements, the areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition; the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities;
fair value of contingent consideration; the assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets; and
leases.
We
perform an impairment test of goodwill for each year unless events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred before that
time. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less
than the carrying amount. After assessing qualitative factors, if further testing is necessary, we would determine the fair value of
each reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit’s carrying amount.
9
Intangible
assets consist of customer relationships, trade names and trademarks and non-compete agreements arising from our acquisitions. Customer
relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over 12 to 15 years. Tradenames, trademarks and non-compete agreements, are amortized
on a straight-line basis over 3 to 10 years.
We
review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not
be recoverable. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the remaining useful life of a long-lived asset is less
than it carrying amount, the asset is considered to be impaired. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount
of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. When fair values are not available, we estimate fair value using the expected future
cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported
at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
Our
significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of our condensed consolidated financial statements.

3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.
ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2022, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Management has determined there is a lack of supervisory review of the financial statement closing
process due to limited resources and formal documentation of procedures and controls. This control deficiency constitutes a material
weakness in internal control over financial reporting. As a result, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting
officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. We plan
to take steps to remedy this material weakness by adding additional resources and completing the formal documentation process of our
controls and procedures.
Disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that the information that is required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act report is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During the three months ended
November, 30, 2022, we actively addressed and remediated a number of previously identified material weaknesses in internal controls over
financial reporting, we significantly improved our accounting processes, documentation, introduced accounting policies and procedures,
upgraded our accounting personnel and provided our employees with necessary tools and resources, but because we have not completed a
full risk assessment of the internal controls over financial reporting at the activity level, including extensive process documentation
and testing, we are not able to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are operating effectively and efficiently
at this time. The Company anticipates fully remediating its material weaknesses by the end of its May 31, 2024 fiscal year end.
