CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS
Certain
statements and information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2023 (this “Report”)
contain or may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the “Securities Act”), Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
We
generally use the words “may,” “should,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,”
“plan,” “anticipate,” “likely,” “estimate,” “potential,” “continue,”
“will,” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not statements
of historical facts, but rather reflect our current expectations concerning future events and results, including, without limitation,
statements related to:
●
our
substantial reliance on, and efforts to diversify our business from, that of our affiliate Bidi Vapor, LLC (“Bidi”);
●
our ability
to obtain the products we distribute from Bidi;
●
the impact of the August 2022 11 th  Circuit Court of Appeals decision overturning the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) previous denial of Bidi’s Premarket Tobacco Product Application (“PMTA”) for its non-tobacco flavored BIDI® Stick electronic nicotine delivery system (“ENDS”),
which we are permitted to distribute in the U.S. subject to FDA enforcement and maintenance of all state licenses and permits;
●
our
substantial reliance on QuikfillRx, LLC (now known as Kaival Marketing Services) to provide key sales, marketing and other
support services to us;
●
our relationships with, and reliance on, third parties to broker and distribute our products;
●
the scope of
future FDA enforcement of regulations in the ENDS products generally;
●
the market perception of the products we distribute and related impacts on our reputation;
●
the
FDA’s approach to the regulation and enforcement of synthetic nicotine and our competitors’ use of the substance
in their products to avoid the PMTA requirements;
●
the impact of black-market goods on our business;
●
the demand
for the products we distribute;
●
anticipated
product performance, and our market and industry expectations;
●
our relationships with key third party commercial collaborators such as Phillip Morris International;
●
our ability
or plans to diversify our product offerings;
●
changes in
government regulation or laws that affect our business; and
●
circumstances
or developments that may make us unable to implement or realize the anticipated benefits, or that may increase the costs of,
our current and planned business initiatives, including matters over which we have little or no control such as the COVID-19
pandemic.
Forward-looking
statements, including those concerning our expectations, involve significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which
are beyond our control, which may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements, or industry results to be materially
different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. See the
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” section contained in this
Report and the section “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022 for a listing
of some of the factors that could cause the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements to differ from actual future
results. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we undertake no obligation
to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
You are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward-looking statements when evaluating the information presented in this Report.

KAIVAL BRANDS INNOVATIONS GROUP, INC.
Notes to
Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 –
Organization and Description of Business
Kaival Brands Innovations Group, Inc.
(the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), formerly known
as Quick Start Holdings, Inc., was incorporated on September 4, 2018, in the State of Delaware.
Description of Business
In March 2020, the Company commenced business
operations as a result of becoming the exclusive distributor of certain electronic nicotine delivery
system (“ENDS”) and related components (the “Products”) manufactured by Bidi Vapor, LLC (“Bidi”),
a related party company that is owned by Nirajkumar Patel, the Chief Science and Regulatory Officer and a director of the Company.
On March 9, 2020, the Company entered into
an exclusive distribution agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with Bidi, which   was amended and restated
on May 21, 2020, and again on April 20, 2021 (collectively, the “A&R Distribution Agreement”). Pursuant to the
A&R Distribution Agreement, Bidi granted the Company an exclusive worldwide right to distribute the Products for sale and resale
to both retail level customers and non-retail level customers. Currently, the Products consist entirely of the “BIDI ®
Stick.” The Company ceased all direct-to-consumer sales in February 2021. On June 10, 2022, and again on November 17,
2022 the Company and Bidi entered into a third amended and restated exclusive distribution agreement (the “Third A&R
Distribution Agreement”) which memorializes the Company’s current business relationship with Bidi.
On August 31, 2020, the Company formed Kaival
Labs, Inc., a Delaware corporation (herein referred to as “Kaival Labs”), as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
for the purpose of developing Company-branded and white-label products and services. The Company has not yet launched any Kaival-branded
product, nor has it begun to provide white label wholesale solutions for other product manufacturers. The Company may also utilize
Kaival Labs to acquire or license complimentary businesses or assets. On March 11, 2022, the Company formed Kaival Brands
International, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (herein referred to as “KBI”), as a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company, for the purpose of entering into an international licensing agreement with Philip Morris Products S.A. (“PMPSA”),
a wholly owned affiliate of Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI”).
Current Product Offerings
Pursuant to the A&R Distribution Agreement,
The Company sells and resells electronic nicotine delivery systems, which it may refer to herein as “ENDS Products”,
or “e-cigarettes”, to non-retail level customers. The sole Product the Company resells is the “BIDI® Stick,”
a disposable, tamper-resistant ENDS product that comes in a variety of flavor options for adult cigarette smokers. The Company
does not manufacture any of the Products it resells. The BIDI® Stick is manufactured by Bidi. Pursuant to the terms of the
A&R Distribution Agreement, Bidi provides the Company with all branding, logos, and marketing materials to be utilized by
the Company in connection with its marketing and promotion of the Products.
F- 6
COVID-19 Impact
In January 2020,
the World Health Organization (the “WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”)
originating in Wuhan, China and the risks to the international community as the virus spread globally beyond its point of origin. In
March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in global exposure.
During the Company’s
fiscal year 2021 and early part of fiscal 2022, the Company was indirectly impacted by supply chain issues and regulatory oversight arising
out of COVID-19. The Company believes that many retailers and distributers relaxed their ENDS compliance standards as an indirect result
of COVID-19 for two reasons: (i) government enforcement of regulations was very limited due to imposed social restrictions, resulting
in less in-person monitor enforcement by government officials and (ii) retail stores experienced light foot traffic from customers due
to COVID-19 restrictions and fears, which resulted in relaxed compliance in an effort to generate additional revenue. While the impact
of COVID-19 decreased during the Company’s fiscal 2022 year and the first quarter of its fiscal 2023 year, outbreaks of COVID-19
or its variants, either locally, nationally or globally,
as well as related supply chain issues, could adversely impact the Company’s business.
Impact of the FDA
PMTA Decision and Subsequent Court Actions
As of January 31, 2022,
the FDA announced that it has taken action on over 99% of applications and issued Marketing Denial Orders (“MDOs”) for more
than 1,167,000 non-tobacco flavored ENDS products, while issuing zero marketing authorizations for such products.
Bidi, along with nearly every other company in the
ENDS industry, received a MDO for its non-tobacco flavored ENDS products. With respect to Bidi, the MDO covered all non-tobacco flavored
BIDI® Sticks, including its Arctic (menthol) BIDI® Stick. As a result, beginning in September 2021, Bidi pursued multiple avenues
to challenge the MDO. First, on September 21, 2021, separate from the judicial appeal of the MDO in its entirety, Bidi filed a 21 C.F.R.
§ 10.75 internal FDA supervisory review request specifically of the decision to include the Arctic (menthol) BIDI® Stick in
the MDO. In May 2022, the FDA issued a determination that it views the Arctic BIDI® Stick as a non-tobacco flavored ENDS product,
and not strictly a menthol flavored product.
On September 29, 2021, Bidi petitioned the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (the “11th Circuit”) to review the FDA’s denial of the comprehensive PMTAs for its
non-tobacco flavored BIDI® Stick ENDS, arguing that it was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”),
as well as ultra vires, for the FDA not to conduct any scientific review of Bidi’s comprehensive applications, as required by the
Tobacco Control Act (“TCA”), to determine whether the BIDI® Sticks are “appropriate for the protection of the public
health”. Bidi further argued that the FDA violated due process and the APA by failing to provide fair notice of the FDA’s
new requirement for ENDS companies to conduct long-term comparative smoking cessation studies for their flavored products, and that the
FDA should have gone through the notice and comment rulemaking process for this requirement.
On October 14, 2021, Bidi requested that the FDA re-review
the MDO and reconsider its position that Bidi did not include certain scientific data in its applications sufficient to allow the PMTAs
to proceed to scientific review. In light of this request, on October 22, 2021, pursuant to 21 C.F.R. § 10.35(a), the FDA issued
an administrative stay of Bidi’s MDO pending its re-review, permitting the Company to continue sales. Subsequently, the FDA decided
not to rescind the MDO and lifted its administrative stay on December 17, 2021. Following the lifting of the FDA’s administrative
stay, Bidi filed a renewed motion to stay the MDO with the 11th Circuit. On February 1, 2022, the appellate court granted Bidi’s
motion to stay (i.e., put on hold) the MDO, again allowing the Company to continue sales pending the litigation on the merits. Oral arguments
in the merits-based proceeding were held on May 17, 2022.
On August 23, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Eleventh Circuit set aside the MDO issued to the non-tobacco flavored BIDI® Sticks and remanded Bidi’s back to the FDA
for further review. Specifically, the Court held that the MDO was “arbitrary and capricious” in violation of the Administrative
Procedure Act (“APA”) because FDA failed to consider the relevant evidence before it, specifically Bidi’s aggressive
and comprehensive marketing and sales-access-restrictions plans designed to prevent youth appeal and access.
F- 7
The 11th Circuit’s opinion further found
indicated that the FDA did not properly review the data and evidence that it has long made clear are critical to the appropriate for the
protection of the public health (“APPH”) standard for PMTAs set forth in the Tobacco Control Act including, in Bidi’s
case, “product information, scientific safety testing, literature reviews, consumer insight surveys, and details about the company’s
youth access prevention measures, distribution channels, and adult-focused marketing practices,” which “target only existing
adult vapor product users, including current adult smokers,” as well as our retailer monitoring program and state-of-the-art anti-counterfeit
authentication system. Because a MDO must be based on a consideration of the relevant factors, such as the marketing and sales-access-restrictions
plans, the denial order was deemed arbitrary and capricious, and vacated by the FDA.
The FDA did not appeal
to the 11th Circuit’s decision. The FDA had until October 7, 2022 (45 days from the August 23, 2022 decision) to either request
a panel rehearing or a rehearing “en banc” (a review by the entire 11th Circuit, not just the 3-judge panel that issued the
decision), and until November 21, 2022 (90 days after the decision) to seek review of the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. No request
for a rehearing was filed, and no petition for a writ of certiorari was made to the Supreme Court. In the meantime, the Company anticipates
continued ability to market and sell the non-tobacco flavored BIDI® Sticks, subject to the FDA’s enforcement discretion, for
the duration of the PMTA scientific review.
Separately, on or about May 13, 2022, FDA placed the
tobacco-flavored Classic BIDI® Stick into the final Phase III scientific review, and in September 2022 completed a remote regulatory
assessment of Bidi and its contract manufacturer in China, SMISS Technology Co. LTD, in relation to the pending PMTA for the Classic BIDI®
Stick.
Risks
and Uncertainties
FDA has indicated that it is prioritizing enforcement
of unauthorized ENDS against companies (1) that never submitted PMTAs, (2) whose PMTAs have been refused acceptance or filing by the FDA,
(3) whose PMTAs remain subject to MDOs, and (4) that are continuing to market unauthorized synthetic nicotine products after the July
13, 2022, cutoff. Subject to FDA’s enforcement discretion, until the scientific review process is complete on each of Bidi’s
PMTAs, the Company views the risk of FDA enforcement against Bidi as low. The Company anticipates FDA will move forward with a review
of Bidi’s PMTA on remand, as directed by the Court; however, the Company cannot provide any assurances as to the timing or outcome.
Accordingly,
the Company anticipates FDA will move forward with a review of Bidi’s PMTA on remand, as directed by the Court.
Moreover, the Company believes that Bidi’s
application is particularly comprehensive, and now includes, among other things, a randomized, crossover, clinical study to assess nicotine
pharmacokinetics and subjective effects of the BIDI® Stick, several behavioral, perception and intention studies, as well as a nationally-representative
population prevalence study. A complete scientific review of the PMTA would require FDA to review all this information before making
an APPH determination, and while FDA could narrowly interpret the Court’s ruling as an order to review only Bidi’s marketing
and sales-access restrictions plans, the 11 th
Circuit’s opinion, in the Company’s view, makes clear that all “relevant
evidence” in an application must be considered. For applications that are in scientific review, FDA typically issues a deficiency
letter identifying its questions before making a marketing authorization decision and gives the applicant at least 90 days to respond.
This further solidifies the Company’s belief that the scientific review of Bidi’s non-tobacco flavored applications could
take 1-2 years or longer. However, the Company cannot provide any assurances as to the timing or outcome.

Basis of Presentation
and Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements
include the financial statements of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Kaival Labs and KBI. Intercompany transactions
are eliminated.
F- 8
Basis of
Presentation
The accompanying unaudited
interim consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and should
be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s most recent audited financial
statements contained within the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on January 30, 2023 (the “2022 Annual
Report”).
In the opinion of management, all
adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations
for the interim period presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements, which would substantially duplicate
the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal period as reported in the 2022 Annual Report,
have been omitted.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary in order to make the financial
statements not misleading have been included. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were
no
cash equivalents
and restricted cash as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022. Cash as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 was
$ 3,773,628
and $ 3,685,893 , respectively.
The
F ederal Deposit Insurance
Corporation
(“FDIC”) insures deposits according to the ownership category in which the funds are insured and
how the accounts are titled. The standard deposit insurance coverage limit is $ 250,000
per
depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category. The Company had uninsured cash and cash equivalents of $ 3,250,651
and
$ 2,912,793
at
January 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022, respectively.
Advertising and Promotion
All advertising, promotion and marketing expenses, including
commissions, are expensed when incurred.
F- 9
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Receivables are stated at cost, net of an allowance
for doubtful accounts. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management’s assessment of the collectability
of accounts receivable. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the amount of the allowance and the Company considers
the historical level of credit losses and collection history and applies percentages to aged receivable categories. The Company makes
judgments about the creditworthiness of debtors based on ongoing credit evaluations and monitors current economic trends that might impact
the level of credit losses in the future. If the financial condition of the debtors were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability
to make payments, a larger allowance may be required. As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, based upon management’s assessment
of the accounts receivable aging and the customers’ payment history, the Company has determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts
is required.
Inventories
All product inventory is purchased from a related party,
Bidi. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes all costs of purchase and other costs
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The Company determines cost based on the first-in,
first-out (“FIFO”) method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less
the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022,
the inventories only consisted of finished goods and were located in three locations: the Company’s main warehouse
located in Florida and two customer warehouses whose service agreements are on a consignment basis with the Company. Based upon fiscal year 2022 inventory management procedures, as well as those inventory management procedures performed
during the first fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2023 and their results for both periods of time, the Company has determined that
no
allowance for inventory was required as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022.
Revenue Recognition
The Company adopted ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with
Customers
(Topic 606) (“ASC 606”), in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, as this was the first quarter that
the Company generated revenues. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods,
in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods. To determine revenue
recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contracts
with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the
transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance
obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration
it is entitled to in exchange for the goods it transfers to the customer. Under ASC 606, disaggregated revenue from contracts with
customers depicts the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows affected by economic factors.
Deferred Revenue
The Company accepts partial payments for
orders from wholesale customers, which it holds as deposits or deferred revenue, until the Company has received full payment and
orders are shipped to the customer. Revenue for these orders is recognized at the time of shipment to the customer. As of January
31, 2023, and October 31, 2022, the Company has $ 12,098
and $ 44,973
in deposits from customers, respectively, which is included with the Company’s current liabilities. As of January 31, 2023,
and October 31, 2022, the Company has $ 129,701
and $ 235,274
in deferred income from PMI guaranteed royalty revenue prepayments, respectively, which is included with the Company’s current
liabilities.
Customer Refunds
The Company infrequently has a need to adjust
the size of an order after it has been shipped, received and paid for, due to the customer oversizing the order for more product that
it can realistically sell at that time. If and when this occurs, the Company will ask the customer to return the over allotted product.
Once received and inspected, the Company will issue a refund for the product return. As of January 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022, the
Company had customer refunds due in the amounts equal to $ 366,956
and $ 0 ,
respectively.
F- 10
Products Revenue
The Company generates products revenue from the sale
of the Products (as defined above) to non-retail customers. The Company recognizes revenue at a point in time based on management’s
evaluation of when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied and control of the Products has
been transferred to the customer. In most situations, transfer of control is considered complete when the products have been shipped to
the customer.  The Company determined that a customer obtains control of the Product upon shipment when title of such product and
risk of loss transfer to the customer. However, when the Company enters a consignment agreement with a new customer, once it ships and
delivers the requested amount of ordered Products to its distribution center for its retail sales locations, the Company retains ownership
of the delivered Products until they are delivered to the actual retail stores (as opposed to the Company’s consignment customer).
The Company’s shipping and handling costs are fulfillment costs, and such amounts are classified as part of cost of sales. The Company
offers credit sales arrangements to non-retail (or wholesale) customers and monitors the collectability of each credit sale routinely.
Revenue is measured by the transaction price, which
is defined as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for providing goods to customers. The transaction price
is adjusted for estimates of known or expected variable consideration, which includes refunds and returns as well as incentive offers
and promotional discounts on current orders. Estimates for sales returns are based on, among other things, an assessment of historical
trends, information from customers, and anticipated returns related to current sales activity. These estimates are established in the
period of sale and reduce revenue in the period of the sale. Variable consideration related to incentive offers and promotional programs
are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on amounts the Company expects to collect. Estimates are regularly updated, and the impact
of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified. In many cases, key sales terms such as pricing and quantities
ordered are established at the time an order is placed and incentives have very short-term durations.
Amounts billed and due from customers
are short term in nature and are classified as receivable since payments are unconditional and only the passage of time related
to credit terms is required before payments are due. The Company does not grant payment financing terms greater than one year.
Payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue, as noted above.
Royalty Revenue
On June 13, 2022, KBI entered into the
PMI License Agreement with PMPSA, effective as of May 13, 2022 (the “PMI Commencement Date”). Pursuant to the PMI License
Agreement, KBI granted PMPSA an exclusive irrevocable license to use its technology, documentation, and intellectual property to
make, distribute, and sell disposable nicotine e-cigarettes Products based on the intellectual property in certain international
markets set forth in the PMI License Agreement (the “PMI Markets”). The Company has the exclusive international distribution
rights to the Products and, in order to allow KBI to fulfill its obligations set forth in the PMI License Agreement, has contributed
the international distribution rights for the PMI Markets to KBI as set forth in a Capital Contribution Agreement, dated June 10,
2022. The sublicense granted to PMPSA is exclusive in the PMI Markets and neither KBI nor any of its affiliates can sell, promote,
use, or distribute any competing products in the PMI Markets for the duration of the term of the PMI License Agreement and any
Sell-Out Period (as defined in the PMI License Agreement). PMSPA will be responsible for any regulatory filings necessary to sell
the Products in the PMI Markets. Both KBI and PMPSA agree to work together in the registration and maintenance of the Intellectual
Property, but KBI will bear all cost and expense to implement the registration strategy. Finally, PMPSA has agreed to potential
future development services with KBI in the PMI Markets and has been granted certain rights with respect to potential future products.
The initial term of the PMI License
Agreement is five (5) years and automatically renews for an additional five-year period unless PMPSA has failed to meet the agreed
upon minimum key performance indicators set forth in the PMI License Agreement, in which case the PMI License Agreement will automatically
terminate at the end of the initial license term.
In consideration for the grant of the
licensed rights, PMPSA agreed to pay to KBI a royalty equal to a percentage of the base price of the first sale of each unit of
Product manufactured. In addition, before the launch of the first product in a market and each anniversary of such launch, PMPSA
agrees to pre-pay to KBI a guaranteed minimum royalty based on the estimated royalties payable by PMPSA to KBI in relation to all
markets in the twelve (12)-month period following the first launch or each successive anniversary of the first launch, subject
to an aggregate maximum guaranteed royalty payment for all markets for each applicable twelve (12)-month period. PMPSA may require
modification of certain products to be sold under the PMI Licensing Agreement to be modified for a PMI Market. Pursuant to the
PMI Licensing Agreement, PMPSA has absolute discretion over sales, marketing, product branding and packaging pertaining to sales
in the PMI Markets, as well as the right to select the specific PMI Markets in which to launch commercialization and determine
what product types are to be promoted in each market, subject to sales and marketing plans and annual business plans set by PMPSA
and certain expansion criteria agreed between PMPSA and KBI. Royalty revenue earned from the PMI License Agreement is recognized
in the period the sales of the Product manufactured occurs.
F- 11
The PMI License Agreement contains customary
representations, warranties, covenants, and indemnification provisions; however, KBI’s liability under the PMI License Agreement
is capped at the greater of: (i) Ten Million Dollars ($ 10,000,000 ); or (ii) an amount equal to the total of the royalties due to
KBI (but not yet paid) plus the royalties (including the guaranteed royalty payment) paid to KBI pursuant to the PMI License Agreement
during the immediately preceding twelve (12) consecutive months, provided that such amount shall not exceed Thirty Million Dollars
($ 30,000,000 ). These royalties may be initially offset on a limited basis by jointly agreed upon costs such as development costs
incurred for entry to specific international markets.
The KBI License agreement provides that
KBI shall pay Bidi license fees equivalent to 50% of the adjusted earned royalty payments, after any offsets due to jointly
agreed costs such development costs incurred for entry to specific international markets. Consequently, the Company has determined
that no license fees are owed to Bidi as of January 31, 2023.
Concentration of Revenues and Accounts Receivable
For the three months ended January 31, 2023,
(i) 25% or $ 599,201
of the revenue from the sale of Products, solely consisting
of the BIDI ®
Stick, was generated from GPM Investments, LLC, (“GPM”), (ii) 18% or $ 432,000
of the revenue from the sale of the Products
was generated from FAVS Business, (“FAVS”), and (iii) approximately 15% or $372,518 of the revenue from the sale of Products,
solely consisting of the BIDI Stick, was generated from H.T. Hackney Co.
For the three

Share-Based Compensation
The
Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments (share-based payments, referred to herein
as “SBP”) based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized over the period during which a recipient
is required to provide service in exchange for the SBP award—the requisite service period (vesting period). For SBP awards subject
to performance conditions , compensation is not recognized
until the performance condition is probable of occurrence. The grant-date fair value of share options is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton
option-pricing model.
The
fair value of each option granted during the fiscal three-month period ended January 31, 2023, and January 31, 2022, was estimated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the weighted average assumptions in the following table:

The expected term

on the volatility in the trading of the Company’s
common stock. The assumed discount rate was the
default risk-free ten-year interest rate for U.S. Treasury bills.
The Company’s
stock option expense for the fiscal three months ended January 31, 2023, and ended January 31, 2022 were $ 1,435,787
and $ 309,700 ,
respectively .
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s balance sheet includes
certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because
of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.
ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures
(“ASC 820”), defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid
to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
(1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and
(2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available
in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority
to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
●
Level
1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted
assets or liabilities.
●
Level
2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or
similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
data by correlation or other means.
●
Level
3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
Fair value estimates
discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of January 31, 2023. The
respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature
of these instruments. These financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses    .
As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022,   the Company
did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements
The Company does not believe that any
recently issued effective pronouncements, or pronouncements issued but not yet effective, if adopted, would have a material effect
on the accompanying financial statements.
Note 3 –
Going Concern
The Company’s financial statements
are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business within one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued.
In accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”), Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial
Statements – Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), our management evaluates whether there are conditions or events, considered in aggregate,
that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements
are issued. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred significant recurring losses ,
which raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
In response to the above, the Company assessed
its management’s plans to alleviate that doubt. The Company has positive working capital as of January 31, 2023, of $ 6,503,841 .
The Company considered that its losses were due to various factors such as: (i) uncertainty surrounding the PMTA process with FDA
and (ii) the MDO that was issued to Bidi Vapor on its non-tobacco flavored ENDS products. However, the MDO was set aside and vacated
by the 11 th
Circuit in August 2022, and the ability to appeal such decision has passed, thereby facilitating the continued
sales of the non-tobacco flavored BIDI® Sticks for sale in the United States (pending FDA’s review of the pending PMTAs and
subject to FDA enforcement). Concurrently, the PMTA for the tobacco-flavored (Classic) BIDI® Sticks for sale in the United States
continues to move through the PMTA scientific review phase. Management’s assessment included the preparation of cash flow forecasts
which considered increases in revenues considering the favorable ruling obtained on the MDO as disclosed above.
The Company believes that its available cash and the
cash to be provided by future operating activities should enable the Company to meet its estimated liquidity needs for the next 12 months
after the date that the financial statements are issued. Because of the above factors, the Company believes that this alleviates the substantial
doubt in connection with the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, there is
no assurance that the Company’s plans will be able to generate expected or greater amounts of revenues or ever achieve
profitability, due to the current economic climate in the United States and globally, the regulation and public perception of ENDS
products and the various other risks faced by the Company. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to
reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of
liabilities that may result from the outcome of these or other risks or uncertainties.
Note 4 –
Leases
The Company capitalizes all leased assets pursuant
to ASU 2016-02,
Leases (Topic 842)
(“Topic 842”), which requires lessees to recognize right-of-use (“ROU”)
assets and lease liability, initially measured at present value of the lease payments, on its balance sheet for leases with terms longer
than 12 months and classified as either financing or operating leases. The Company excludes short-term leases having initial terms of
12 months or less from Topic 842 as an accounting policy election and recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease
term.
T he Company does not have financing leases and only one operating lease for office space and
inventory storage space with Just Pick, LLC (“Just Pick”), a related party owned and controlled by Nirajkumar Patel, the Chief
Science and Regulatory Officer and a director of the Company, as of January 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022. Certain of the Company’s
leases, have and may in the future, include renewal options, which have been and might be in the future, included in the calculation of
the lease liabilities and right of use assets when the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the option.
F- 14
Office and Storage Space
On November 1, 2021,
the Company entered
into a month-to-month lease agreement with Ranger Enterprises, LLC, located in Seymour, Indiana, to store product inventory at
this satellite location. The Company made payments on this lease in the amount of $19,959. The lease was terminated in June 2022.
On November 11, 2021,
the Company entered
into a month- to-month lease agreement with FFE Solutions Group, located in Salt Lake City Utah, to store additional product inventory
at this satellite location. The Company made payments on this lease in the amount of $19,108. This lease was terminated in April
2022.
On June 10, 2022, the
Company entered into a Lease Agreement (the “2022 Lease”) with
Just Pick for approximately
21,332 rentable square feet combined in the office building and warehouse located at 4460 Old Dixie Highway, Grant-Valkaria, Florida
32949 (the “Premises”), together with all improvements thereon. The Company must pay Just Pick base rent equal to $ 17,776 .67
per month during the first year of the Lease Term with a five-year lease renewal option. Thereafter, the monthly base rent will be
increased annually with a monthly base rent of $ 18,665 .50
in the second year, $ 19,554 .33
in the third year, $ 20,443 .17
in the fourth year, $ 22,220 .83
in the fifth year, $ 23,998 .50
in the sixth year, and one twelfth (1/12th) of the market annual rent for the seventh through eleventh years, if applicable. In
addition to the base rent, the Company must pay one hundred percent (100%) of operating expenses, insurance costs, and taxes for
each calendar year during the Lease term. For both the ROU asset and ROU liability, the lease renewal option was considered in the
calculation with an incremental borrowing rate of
4.5 %.
The Company had $ 46,949

Overview
We are focused on
growing and incubating innovative and profitable products into mature, dominant brands, with a current focus on the distribution
of electronic nicotine delivery systems (“ENDS”), also known as “e-cigarettes”. Our business plan is to
seek to diversify into distributing other nicotine and non-nicotine delivery system products (including those related to hemp-derived
c annabidiol (known as CBD) products .
Pursuant
to the A&R Distribution Agreement, Bidi granted us an exclusive worldwide right to distribute Bidi’s ENDS as well as
non-electronic nicotine delivery systems and related components (as more particularly set forth in the A&R Distribution Agreement,
the “Products”) for sale and resale to both retail level customers and non-retail level customers. Currently, the Products
consist solely of the “ BIDI ®  Stick ”,  Bidi’s
disposable, tamper resistant  ENDS product  made
with medical-grade components, a UL-certified battery and technology designed to deliver a consistent vaping experience for adult
smokers 21 and over.  We presently distribute Products to wholesalers and retailers of ENDS
products, having ceased all direct-to-consumer sales in February 2021. Nirajkumar Patel, our Chief Science and Regulatory Officer
and director and an indirect controlling shareholder of our company, owns Bidi.
BIDI ®  Stick
comes in a variety of flavor options for adult cigarette smokers. We do not manufacture any of the Products we resell. The BIDI®
Stick is manufactured by Bidi. Pursuant to the terms of the A&R Distribution Agreement, Bidi provides us with all branding,
logos, and marketing materials to use with our commercial partners use in connection with our marketing and promotion of the Products.
We process all sales
made only to non-retail customers, with all sales to non-retail customers made through Bidi’s age-restricted website, www.wholesale.bidivapor.com.
We ceased all direct-to-consumer sales in February 2021 in order to better ensure youth access prevention and to comply with
the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking (“PACT”) Act. We provide all customer service and support at our own expense.
We set the minimum prices for all sales made by us. We maintain adequate inventory levels of the Products in order to meet the
demands of our non-retail customers, and deliver the Products sold to these customers.
A key third party
collaborator of ours is QuikfillRx, LLC, (“QuikfillRx”) a Florida limited liability company which recently began doing
business as “Kaival Marketing Services” to better reflect its contributions to our company. QuikfillRx provides us
with certain services and support relating to sales management, website development and design, graphics, content, public communication,
social media, management and analytics, and market and other research. QuikfillRx provides these services to us pursuant to a Services
Agreement, most recently amended on November 9, 2022, which has a current term ending on October 31, 2025 (subject to potential
one-year extensions) and pursuant to which QuikfillRx receives monthly cash compensation and was granted certain equity compensation
in the form of options.
We have also entered
into key international licensing agreements with Philip Morris Products S.A. (“PMPSA”), a wholly owned affiliate of
Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI”).
On August 31, 2020,
we formed Kaival Labs, Inc., a Delaware corporation (herein referred to as “Kaival Labs”), as a wholly owned subsidiary
for the purpose of developing our own branded and white-label products and services, of which none has commenced as of the date
of this Report. On March 11, 2022, we formed Kaival Brands International, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (herein referred
to as “KBI”), as a wholly owned subsidiary for the purpose of entering into an international licensing agreement with
PMPSA.

FDA
PMTA Determinations, 11 th  Circuit
Decision and Impact on Our Business
In September
2021, in connection with the Bidi’s Premarket Tobacco Product Application (“PMTA”) process for
BIDI ®  Stick, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) effectively “banned”
non-tobacco flavored ENDS by denying nearly all then-pending PMTAs for such products (including Bidi’s). Following the
issuance of by the FDA of a related Marketing Denial Order (“MDO”) regarding these ENDS products, manufacturers were
required to stop selling non-tobacco flavored ENDS products. Bidi, along with nearly every other company in the ENDS industry,
received a MDO for its non-tobacco flavored ENDS products. With respect to Bidi, the MDO covered all non-tobacco flavored BIDI®
Sticks, including its Arctic (menthol) BIDI® Stick. As a result, beginning in September 2021, Bidi pursued multiple avenues to
challenge the MDO. First, on September 21, 2021, separate from the judicial appeal of the MDO in its entirety, Bidi filed a 21
C.F.R. §10.75 internal FDA supervisory review request specifically of the decision to include the Arctic (menthol) BIDI®
Stick in the MDO. In May 2022, the FDA issued a determination that it views the Arctic BIDI® Stick as a non-tobacco flavored
ENDS product, and not strictly a menthol flavored product.
On September 29, 2021, Bidi
petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (the “11th Circuit”) to review the FDA’s denial of the
PMTAs for its non-tobacco flavored BIDI® Stick ENDS (including the Arctic BIDI® Stick), arguing that it was arbitrary and capricious
under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), as well as ultra vires, for the FDA not to conduct any scientific review of
Bidi’s comprehensive applications, as required by the Tobacco Control Act (“TCA”), to determine whether the BIDI®
Sticks are “appropriate for the protection of the public health”. Bidi further argued that the FDA violated due process and
the APA by failing to provide fair notice of the FDA’s new requirement for ENDS companies to conduct long-term comparative smoking
cessation studies for their non-tobacco flavored products compared to tobacco-flavored ENDS products, and that the FDA should have gone
through the notice and comment rulemaking process for this requirement.
On August 23,
2022, the 11 th  Circuit set aside (i.e., vacated) the MDO issued to the non-tobacco flavored BIDI® Sticks and
remanded Bidi’s PMTA back to the FDA for further review. Specifically, the 11 th  Circuit held that the MDO
was “arbitrary and capricious” in violation of the APA because the FDA failed to consider the relevant evidence before
it, specifically Bidi’s aggressive and comprehensive marketing and sales-access-restrictions plans designed to prevent youth
appeal and access.
The 11 th  Circuit’s
opinion further indicated that the FDA did not properly review the data and evidence that it has long made clear are critical to the appropriate
for the protection of the public health (“APPH”) standard for PMTAs set forth in the Tobacco Control Act including, in Bidi’s
case, “product information, scientific safety testing, literature reviews, consumer insight surveys, and details about the company’s
youth access prevention measures, distribution channels, and adult-focused marketing practices,” which “target only existing
adult vapor product users, including current adult smokers,” as well as our retailer monitoring program and state-of-the-art anti-counterfeit
authentication system. Because a MDO must be based on a consideration of the relevant factors, such as the marketing and sales-access-restrictions
plans, the denial order was deemed arbitrary and capricious, and vacated by the FDA.
The FDA did
not appeal to the 11th Circuit’s decision. The FDA had until October 7, 2022 (45 days from the August 23, 2022 decision)
to either request a panel rehearing or a rehearing “en banc” (a review by the entire 11th Circuit, not just the 3-judge
panel that issued the decision), and until November 21, 2022 (90 days after the decision) to seek review of the decision by the
U.S. Supreme Court. No request for a rehearing was filed, and no petition for a writ of certiorari was made to the Supreme Court.
In light of the 11th Circuit
decision, we anticipate having the continued ability to market and sell the non-tobacco flavored BIDI® Sticks, subject to FDA’s
enforcement discretion, for the duration of the PMTA scientific review. The FDA has indicated that it is prioritizing enforcement of unauthorized
ENDS against companies (1) that never submitted PMTAs, (2) whose PMTAs have been refused acceptance or filing by the FDA, (3) whose PMTAs
remain subject to MDOs, and (4) that are continuing to market unauthorized synthetic nicotine products after the July 13, 2022 cutoff.
As none of these scenarios apply to Bidi, we believe the current risk of FDA enforcement is low.
Since the PMTA was remanded, Bidi has continued to
update its application with the results of new studies, including a nationwide population prevalence study on the BIDI® Stick that
is currently undergoing peer review for publication.
Separately, on or about May 13, 2022, FDA placed the
tobacco-flavored Classic BIDI® Stick into the final Phase III scientific review, and in September 2022 completed a remote regulatory
assessment of Bidi and its contract manufacturer in China, SMISS Technology Co. LTD, in relation to the pending PMTA for the Classic BIDI®
Stick.

Material Items, Trends
and Risks Impacting Our Business
We
believe that the following items and trends may be useful in better understanding our results of operations.
Dependence on Bidi
and Nirajkumar Patel
We are wholly dependent on Bidi to supply the BIDI®
Sticks to us for distribution. Accordingly, any supply or other issues that impact Bidi, indirectly impact us and our ability to operate
our business. Moreover, and while we are seeking to diversify our product offerings, the loss of our relationship with Bidi would substantially
harm the viability of our business.
Bidi is controlled by Nirajkumar Patel, our Chief
Science and Regulatory Officer and a director of the Company. Moreover, Kaival Holdings, an entity controlled by Mr. Patel, is our majority
shareholder. In addition, our corporate headquarters is leased to us by an affiliate of Mr. Patel. Therefore, Mr. Patel has the power
and ability to control or influence our business.
Dependence on QuikfillRx,
LLC and Distributors
We are substantially dependent
on QuikfillRx, LLC (d/b/a Kaival Marketing Services, or KMS) to provide key marketing, sales and other support services to us. In addition,
we rely on third-party brokers and distributors to introduce and place our products into our historic foundation of
convenience-stores
and more recently into new retail channels, including dollar, grocery and mass-merchandisers. The loss of one or more of these key relationships
would have a material adverse effect on our business.
Nature
of our Products and Regulation
Competition
in the market for e-cigarettes from illicit sources may have an adverse effect on our overall sales volume, restricting our ability to
increase selling prices and damaging our brand equity and reputation. Illicit trade and tobacco trafficking in the form of counterfeit
products, smuggled genuine products, and locally manufactured products on which applicable taxes or regulatory requirements are evaded,
represent a significant and growing threat to the legitimate tobacco industry, including the products we sell.
Although
we combat counterfeiting of our Products by engaging in certain tactics, such as requiring all sales force personnel to randomly collect
our Products from retailers in order to be tested by our quality control team, maintaining a quality control group that is responsible
for identifying counterfeit products and surveillance of retailers we suspect are selling counterfeit Products through our own secret
shopper force, no assurance can be given that we will be able to detect or stop sales of all counterfeit products. In addition, while
we may bring suits against retailers and distributors that sell certain counterfeit products, no assurance can be given that we will be
successful in any such suits or that such suits will be successful in stopping other retailers or distributors from selling counterfeit
products.
Our
Products are regulated by the FDA, which has broad regulatory powers. The market for ENDS products is subject to a great deal of uncertainty
and is still evolving. ENDS products, having recently been introduced to market over the past 10 to 15 years, are at a relatively early
stage of development, and represent core components of a market that is evolving rapidly, highly regulated, and characterized by a number
of market participants. Rapid growth in the use of, and interest in, ENDS products is recent, and may not continue on a lasting basis.
The demand and market acceptance for these products is subject to a high level of uncertainty. Therefore, we are subject to all the business
risks associated with a new enterprise in an evolving market.
Some of our Product offerings through Bidi are subject
to developing and unpredictable regulation. Our Products are sold through our distribution network and may be subject to uncertain and
evolving federal, state, and local regulations, including hemp, non-THC cannabidiol (CBD) and other non-tobacco consumable products.
Enforcement initiatives by those authorities are therefore unpredictable and impossible to anticipate. We anticipate that all levels
of government, which have not already done so, are likely to seek in some way to regulate these products, but the type, timing, and impact
of such regulations remains uncertain. With respect to CBD in particular, on January 26, 2023, FDA announced that it would not initiate
rulemaking to regulate CBD as a dietary food ingredient. Rather, after careful review, the FDA has concluded that a new regulatory pathway
for CBD is needed and has further indicated that it is prepared to work with Congress to create a new regulatory pathway for CBD through
legislation.
In
addition to the de facto FDA flavor ban that has resulted from the denial
of nearly all PMTAs for flavored ENDS, ENDS products that are non-tobacco flavored continue to face the threat of prohibition at the local
level, as many state and local authorities and attorneys general push for bans or request the FDA to deny PMTAs for flavored ENDS. In
addition, a number of states and localities have banned the sale of non-tobacco flavored tobacco products. Recently, for example, California
passed Proposition 31, which prohibits the sale of non-tobacco flavored tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, in retail locations.
Thus, the non-tobacco flavored BIDI® Sticks are not permitted to be sold in California retail locations. We anticipate more states
and localities will take this approach. Several other states have banned flavored ENDS, including New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island,
and Massachusetts, with several more considering similar bans (e.g., Maryland, and Connecticut).
Inflation
Consumer purchases of tobacco
products are historically affected by economic conditions, such as changes in employment, salary and wage levels, the availability of
consumer credit, inflation, interest rates, fuel prices, sales taxes, and the level of consumer confidence in prevailing and future economic
conditions. The U.S. has been experiencing an environment of material inflation in recent quarters, and this condition may impact discretionary
consumer purchases, such as the BIDI® Stick. Demand for our Products may also decline during recessionary periods or at other times
when disposable income is lower, and taxes may be higher.
Supply
Chain
The spread of COVID-19 throughout
the world as well as increasing tensions with China over the past several years has created global economic uncertainty, which may cause
partners, suppliers, and potential customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce activities. Any of the foregoing could materially
adversely affect the supply chain for Bidi and our Products, and any supply chain distribution for the Products could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.
Corporate History
We were incorporated on September 4, 2018, in the
State of Delaware. Effective July 12, 2019, we changed our corporate name from Quick Start Holdings, Inc. to Kaival Brands Innovations
Group, Inc. The name change was effected through a parent/subsidiary short-form merger of Kaival Brands Innovations Group, Inc., our wholly-owned
Delaware subsidiary formed solely for the purpose of the name change, with and into us. We were the surviving entity.
Change of Control
On February 6, 2019, we entered into a Share Purchase
Agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”), by and among us, GMRZ Holdings LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“GMRZ”),
our then-controlling stockholder, and Kaival Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“KH”), pursuant to which,
on February 20, 2019, GMRZ sold 504,000,000 shares of our restricted common stock, representing approximately 88.06% of our then issued
and outstanding shares of common stock, to KH, and KH paid GMRZ consideration in the amount set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement.
The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement resulted in a change in control, with KH becoming our
largest controlling stockholder. Nirajkumar Patel and Eric Mosser are the sole voting members of KH.

Current Product Offerings
Pursuant to the A&R Distribution Agreement, The
Company sells and resells electronic nicotine delivery systems, which it may refer to herein as “ENDS Products”, or “e-cigarettes”,
to non-retail level customers. The sole Product the Company resells is the “BIDI® Stick,” a disposable, tamper-resistant
ENDS product that comes in a variety of flavor options for adult cigarette smokers. The Company does not manufacture any of the Products
it resells. The BIDI® Stick is manufactured by Bidi. Pursuant to the terms of the A&R Distribution Agreement, Bidi provides the
Company with all branding, logos, and marketing materials to be utilized by the Company in connection with its marketing and promotion
of the Products.
Other Potential Product Offerings
In addition to the BIDI® Stick, we anticipated
launching distribution of the “BIDI® Pouch,” initially outside of the United States. The initial planned February 2021
roll-out of the BIDI® Pouch was delayed due to COVID-19 based manufacturing and supply chain constraints. Due to these complications,
and in an effort to prevent future bottlenecks, Bidi decided to move manufacturing in-house. In 2021, Bidi modified the planned formulation
of the BIDI® Pouch. The original BIDI® Pouch formulation (which never came to market) intended to utilize a tobacco-free (synthetic)
nicotine formulation, along with natural fibers and a chew-base filler in six different flavors. However, production of the BIDI®
Pouch was placed on hold domestically due to concerns about the safety of synthetic nicotine and the likelihood of the FDA enforcement
of synthetic nicotine products either as unapproved drugs or unauthorized tobacco products. Subsequently, the Consolidated Appropriations
Act of 2022, signed by President Biden on March 15, 2022, amended the definition of a “tobacco product” in the Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act and gave the FDA authority to regulate products containing nicotine from any source, including synthetic nicotine. The
legislation also gave manufacturers of synthetic nicotine products 60 days to prepare and submit PMTAs by May 14, 2022. Synthetic nicotine
products subject to timely submitted PMTAs were allowed to remain on the market without the threat of enforcement for another 60 days,
until July 13, 2022. After July 13, 2022, all synthetic nicotine products, regardless of PMTA status, are illegal and subject to FDA enforcement
(unless the product has actually been authorized and is subject to a PMTA Marketing Grant Order).
Also, on July 14, 2021, we announced plans to launch
its first Kaival-branded product, a hemp CBD vaping product. In addition to our branded formulation, we anticipate that we will also provide
white label, wholesale solutions for other product manufacturers through its subsidiary, Kaival Labs. We have not yet launched any branded
product, nor has have begun to provide white label wholesale solutions for other product manufacturers, but the diversification of the
types of products we distribute is an important part of our growth strategy.
Assuming we launch a hemp CBD product, of which there
can be no assurances, we intend that all CBD products will be produced and distributed strictly in compliance under the Agriculture Improvement
Act of 2018 (known as the 2018 Farm Bill), which defines hemp as the plant cannabis sativa and any part of the plant with a delta-9 THC
concentration of not more than 0.3 percent by dry weight. According to the 2018 Farm Bill, hemp-derived products can be offered for retail
sale in many forms: smoke, pouch, tinctures, topicals, capsules, vape oil and gummies/edibles. We plan to utilize Bidi’s patented
BIDI® Stick delivery mechanism in order to provide a similar, premium experience in the initial CBD product line. We expect our industrial-grade
hemp CBD formula to provide greater bioavailability than many market peers, resulting in a better consumer experience in less usage. On
January 26, 2023, FDA announced that it would not initiate rulemaking to regulate CBD as a dietary food ingredient. Rather, after careful
review, the FDA has concluded that a new regulatory pathway for CBD is needed that balances individuals’ desire for access to CBD
products with the regulatory oversight needed to manage risks. FDA further indicated that it is prepared to work with Congress on this
matter.
PMI Licensing Agreement and International Distribution
On June 13, 2022, we, through our wholly
owned subsidiary, KBI, entered into the PMI License Agreement with PMPSA, a wholly owned affiliate of PMI, for the development
and distribution of ENDS products in certain markets outside of the United States, subject to market (or regulatory assessment).
The PMI License Agreement grants to PMPSA a license of certain intellectual property rights relating to Bidi’s ENDS device,
known as the BIDI® Stick in the United States, as well as potentially newly developed devices, to permit PMPSA to manufacture,
promote, sell, and distribute such ENDS device and newly developed devices, in international markets, outside of the United States.
On July 25, 2022, we announced the launch of PMPSA’s
custom-branded self-contained e-vapor product, pursuant to the licensing agreement. The product, a self-contained e-vapor device, VEEBA,
has been custom developed and is now being distributed in Canada. VEEBA was then commercially launched by PMPSA in Europe in February
2023 and we expect to generate royalty revenues pursuant to the licensing agreement beginning in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 (quarter
ending October 31, 2023), with additional market launches planned this year.
Going Concern
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business within one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued.
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board (the “FASB”), Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-15,
Presentation of Financial Statements –
Going Concern
(Subtopic 205-40), our management evaluates whether there are conditions or events, considered in aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred significant recurring losses, which raises substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
In response to the above, our management assessed
our plans to alleviate that doubt. We had positive working capital as of January 31, 2023, of $6,503,841. Management considered that the
Company’s losses were due to various factors such as: (i) uncertainty surrounding the PMTA process with FDA and (ii) the MDO that
was issued to Bidi Vapor on its non-tobacco flavored ENDS products. However, the MDO was set aside and vacated by the 11 th
Circuit in August 2022, and the ability to appeal such decision has passed, thereby facilitating the continued sales of the non-tobacco
flavored BIDI® Sticks for sale in the United States (pending FDA’s review of the pending PMTAs and subject to FDA enforcement).
Concurrently, the PMTA for the tobacco-flavored (Classic) BIDI® Sticks for sale in the United States continues to move through the
PMTA scientific review phase (pending FDA’s review of that PMTA). Management’s assessment included the preparation of cash
flow forecasts which considered increases in revenues considering the favorable ruling obtained on the MDO as disclosed above.
4
We believe that our available cash and the cash
to be provided by future operating activities should enable the Company to meet its estimated liquidity needs for the next 12 months
after the date that the financial statements included within this Report are issued. Because of the above factors, our management
believe that this condition alleviates the substantial doubt in connection with our ability to continue as a going concern.
However, there is
no assurance that the Company’s plans will be able to generate expected or greater amounts of revenues or ever achieve
profitability, due to the current economic climate in the United States and globally, the regulation and public perception of ENDS
products and
the various other risks faced by
the Company. The consolidated financial statements included in this Report do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible
future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result
from the outcome of these or other risks or uncertainties.
5
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We
believe we have sufficient cash on hand as of the date of this Report to support our operations for at least 12 months. As of January
31, 2023, we had working capital of approximately $6.6 million and total cash of approximately $3.8 million.
We intend to generally rely on cash
from operations and equity and debt offerings to the extent necessary and available, to satisfy our liquidity needs. There are
a number of factors that could result in the need to raise additional funds, including a decline in revenue or a lack of anticipated
sales growth and increased costs. Our efforts are directed toward generating positive cash flow and, ultimately, profitability.
If these efforts are not successful, we may need to raise additional capital. Should capital not be available to us at reasonable
terms, other actions may become necessary in addition to cost control measures and continued efforts to increase sales. These actions
may include exploring strategic options for the sale of the Company, the creation of joint ventures or strategic alliances under
which we will pursue business opportunities, or other alternatives. We believe we have the financial resources to weather any short-term
impacts of the FDA’s PMTA process and Bidi’s receipt of a MDO from the FDA, which has now been set aside and remanded
by the 11th Circuit. At this time, we do not foresee the need for further strategic financing for the next twelve months, given
the financing we completed in September 2021, as indicated below, and our continual sales efforts and results.
Cash Flows:
Cash flow provided by
operations was approximately $0.1 million for the first three months of fiscal year 2023, compared to $2.1 million used in operations
for the first three months of fiscal year 2022. The increase in cash flow provided by operations for the first three months of fiscal
year 2023 compared to the first three months of fiscal 2022     was
primarily due to changes in related party accounts payable, and income tax receivable.
The Company had cash flow used in investing
activities of approximately $3,400 for the first three months of fiscal year 2023, compared to no cash flow used in investing activities
for the first three months of fiscal year 2022. The cash used in investing activities for the first three months of fiscal year
2023 consisted of cash used for the purchase of warehouse equipment.
The Company had no
net cash flow from financing activities for the first three months of fiscal year 2023, compared to cash flow used in financing
activities of approximately $35,000 for the first three months of fiscal year 2022.
The
cash used in financing activities for the first three months of fiscal year of 2022 consisted of cash used for the settlement of
RSUs issued to employees.

Results of Operations
Three months ended January 31, 2023,
compared to three months ended January 31, 2022
Revenues :
Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal year
2023 were approximately $2.5 million, compared to approximately $2.8 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. Revenues
decreased in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to credits/discounts/rebates issued to customers. We do not anticipate this
trend to continue as renewed distribution ramps up and sales of non-tobacco flavored BIDI ®
Sticks increase, and even
more so now that the MDO has been vacated, which allows us to continue marketing and selling the Products, subject to the
FDA’s enforcement discretion.
Cost of Revenue, Net and Gross Profit (Loss):
Gross profit in
the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 was approximately $0.5 million, or approximately 21.4% of revenues, net, compared to
approximately ($0.7) million gross   loss or
approximately (24.3%), of revenues, net, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Total cost of revenue, net was approximately
$2.0 million, or approximately 78.6% of revenue, net for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, compared to approximately $3.5
million, or approximately 124.3% of revenue, net for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. The increase in gross profit is
primarily driven by the improvement in overall unit pricing, being offset by the credits/discounts/rebates issued to customers,
totaling approximately $0.7 million, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.
Operating Expenses:
Total operating expenses
were approximately $3.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, compared to approximately $2.1 million for the first quarter
of fiscal year 2022. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, operating expenses consisted primarily of advertising and promotion fees
of approximately $0.6 million, stock option expense of approximately $1.4 million, professional fees of approximately $0.6 million, and
all other general and administrative expenses of approximately $0.9 million. General and administrative expenses in the first quarter
of fiscal year 2023 consisted primarily of salaries and wages, stock option expense, insurance, lease expense, project expenses, banking
fees, business fees and state and franchise taxes. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, operating expenses were approximately $2.1
million, consisting primarily of advertising and promotion fees of approximately $0.6 million, stock option expense of 0.3 million, professional
fees totaling approximately $0.5 million, and all other general and administrative expenses of approximately $0.7 million.
General
and administrative expenses consisted primarily of salaries and wages, insurance, banking fees, business fees, and other service fees.
We expect future operating expenses to increase while we increase the footprint of our business and generate increased sales growth.
Income Taxes:
During the first quarter of fiscal year
2023, we did not accrue a tax provision for income taxes, due to the pre-tax loss of approximately ($3.1) million, similarly we
did not accrue a tax provision for income taxes, due to the pre-tax loss of approximately ($2.8) million for the first quarter
of fiscal year 2022.
7
Net Loss:
As
a result of the items noted above, the net loss for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 was approximately $3.0 million, or $0.05 basic
and diluted net loss per share, compared to a net loss of approximately $2.8 million, or $0.09 basic and diluted net loss   per
share, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. The increase in the net loss for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, as compared
to the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, is primarily attributable to the decrease revenues and increase in customer credits/discounts/rebates,
as noted above.
Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates
Other than the policy changes disclosed in Note 2,  Basis
of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,  to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of
this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended
January 31, 2023 from those disclosed in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
of our 2022 Annual Report for the year ended October 31, 2022.
Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company,”
that is exempt from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years as defined in the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). The JOBS Act eases restrictions on the sale of securities and increases
the number of stockholders a company must have before becoming subject to the SEC’s reporting and disclosure rules. We have
not elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2)
of the JOBS Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates
for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.
As a “smaller reporting company”
as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and
other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitations, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer
and our principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Under
the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our President and Chief Operating Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of January
31, 2023, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the President and Chief Operating Officer
and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that because of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of January 31, 2023.
Some
of those internal controls include multiple levels of review of the accounting and reporting procedures and processes, lack of proper
segregation of duties, lack of sufficient and consistent real time remote communications, as well as certain accounting and reporting
issues .
Remediation of Material Weaknesses
We are committed
to maintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that all material weaknesses are
remediated as soon as possible.
Management will continue to work to improve its disclosure controls and procedures during
fiscal 2023 with the goal of improvement in the effectiveness of its systems in our internal controls during the next 12 months. We intend
to hire additional staff and to take such other actions as may be necessary to address its material weaknesses. The Company did add additional
financial and accounting personnel during its fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, and as such, we believe we have made progress in the
implementation of certain internal controls, such as multiple levels of review and analysis of the accounting and reporting procedures
and processes, and of journal entries and general ledger account reconciliations.
Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting
Due to the identification
of certain material weaknesses ,  we continue to work on strengthening our internal control structure. We made no other changes
in internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended
January 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
