Organization and Description of Business
Description
of business
Sonnet
BioTherapeutics, Inc. (“Prior Sonnet”) was incorporated as a New Jersey corporation on April 6, 2015. Prior Sonnet completed
a merger with publicly-held Chanticleer Holdings, Inc. (“Chanticleer”) on April 1, 2020. After the merger, Chanticleer changed
its name to Sonnet BioTherapeutics Holdings, Inc. (“Sonnet” or the “Company”). Sonnet is a clinical stage, oncology-focused
biotechnology company with a proprietary platform for innovating biologic medicines of single- or bi-specific action. Known as F H AB™
(Fully Human Albumin Binding), the technology utilizes a fully human single chain antibody fragment (scFv) that binds to and “hitch-hikes”
on human serum albumin (“HSA”) for transport to target tissues. Sonnet’s lead proprietary asset, SON-1010, is a fully
human version of Interleukin 12 (“IL-12”), covalently linked to the FHAB construct, for which Sonnet intends to pursue clinical
development in solid tumor indications, including non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer. Sonnet has completed a nonhuman
primate (“NHP”) GLP toxicity study and has successfully manufactured drug product for clinical use. In March 2022, the FDA
cleared Sonnet’s Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for SON-1010. This allowed the Company to initiate a
U.S. clinical trial (SB101) in oncology patients with solid tumors during the second calendar quarter of 2022. In September 2021, the
Company created a wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, SonnetBio Pty Ltd (“Subsidiary”), for the purpose of conducting certain
clinical trials. Sonnet received approval and initiated an Australian clinical study (SB102) of SON-1010 in healthy volunteers during
the third calendar quarter of 2022.
Initial safety and tolerability data from the SB101 and SB102
studies were reported during the calendar fourth quarter of 2022, and additional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from both studies
is expected during the second calendar quarter of 2023.
The
Company acquired the global development rights to its most advanced compound, SON-080, a fully human version of Interleukin 6 (“IL-6”),
in April 2020 through its acquisition of the outstanding shares of Relief Therapeutics SA. Sonnet is advancing SON-080 in target indications
of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (“CIPN”) and Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (“DPN”). Sonnet received
approval to initiate an ex-U.S. Phase 1b/2a study with SON-080 in CIPN. This study could yield initial clinical safety data during the
first half of 2023. Pursuant to a license agreement the Company entered with New Life Therapeutics Pte, Ltd. (“New Life”)
of Singapore in May 2021, Sonnet and New Life will be jointly responsible for developing SON-080 in DPN.
The
objective will be to evaluate the data and potentially initiate a Phase 2 study in the second half of 2023, once the CIPN safety data
has been evaluated.
SON-1210
(IL12-F H AB-IL15), Sonnet’s lead bi-specific construct, combines F H AB with fully human IL-12 and fully human
Interleukin 15 (“IL-15”). This compound is being developed for solid tumor indications, including colorectal cancer.
An
NHP study was completed in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022, and Sonnet expects to initiate the regulatory authorization process in
the first half of 2023. Manufacturing and drug supply are secured with a lyophilized drug product formulation being prepared during the
first calendar quarter of 2023, which is expected to be suitable for first-in-human clinical trials.
SON-1410
(IL18-FHAB-IL12) is a bispecific combination of Interleukins 18 (IL-18) and 12 (IL-12) for solid tumor cancers. Cell line development
and process development are ongoing, with early experimental drug supply suitable for formulation and analytical method development activities,
in addition to small quantities for use in early development proof-of-concept in vitro studies. Process development activities will continue
through 2023, with the potential to generate a drug suitable for initial
in vivo
mouse studies by the end of the 2023 calendar
year.
The
Company has completed sequence confirmation for SON-3015 (anti-IL6-F H AB-anti-TGFβ).
Early
stage bi-specific drug has been generated and is being stored for future use in
in vivo
mice studies. Sonnet has elected to place
the SON-3015 development program on hold for expense reduction purposes.

Sonnet BioTherapeutics

Notes to Unaudited Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements
Liquidity
The
Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and it expects to generate losses from
operations for the foreseeable future primarily due to research and development costs for its potential product candidates. The
Company believes its cash of $ 1.7
million at
December 31, 2022, together with the $ 1.0
million gross proceeds received from the 2022 Sales Agreement (as defined below) in January 2023 and an estimated $ 13.5
million in net proceeds received from an underwritten public offering in February 2023,
will fund the Company’s projected operations into February 2024 . Substantial
additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course
of business. The interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.
On February 10, 2023, the Company closed a public offering of common stock and certain warrants through Chardan Capital
Markets, LLC and EF Hutton, division of Benchmark Investments LLC as underwriters, for estimated net proceeds of $ 13.5
million through
the issuance and sale of
11,664,888
shares of its common stock and, to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase
2,224,000
shares
of common stock, and accompanying common warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of
27,777,776
shares of its common stock (the “February
Offering”). Each share of common stock and pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of common stock was sold together with a common
warrant to purchase two shares of common stock. The public offering price of each share of common stock and accompanying common warrant
was $ 1.08
and $ 1.0799
for each pre-funded warrant and accompanying common warrant. The pre-funded warrants are immediately exercisable
at a price of $ 0.0001
per share of common stock. The common warrants are immediately exercisable at a price of $ 1.08
per share of common
stock, expire five years from the date of issuance and contain an alternative cashless exercise provision whereby, subject to certain
conditions, a warrant may be exercised in a cashless transaction for shares of common stock at the rate of half a share of common stock per full share
otherwise issuable upon a cash exercise.
The
Company entered into an At-the-Market Sales Agreement with BTIG, LLC (“BTIG”) on August 15, 2022 (the “2022 Sales Agreement”).
Pursuant to the 2022 Sales Agreement, the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through BTIG, as sales agent and/or principal,
shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $ 25.0
million, subject to certain limitations on the amount of
common stock that may be offered and sold by the Company set forth in the 2022 Sales Agreement. Due to the offering limitations applicable
to the Company under General Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3 and the Company’s public float as of August 15, 2022, and in accordance
with the terms of the 2022 Sales Agreement, the Company could offer shares having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $ 6.1
million
pursuant to the prospectus supplement dated August 15, 2022, filed in connection with the 2022 Sales Agreement. As of November 9, 2022,
the Company had sold an aggregate of
2,477,287
shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $ 6.1
million, and the Company filed a prospectus
supplement dated November 9, 2022 registering the offer and sale of shares of its common stock for an aggregate offering price of up
to an additional $ 1.7
million pursuant to the 2022 Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has sold an aggregate of
603,737
shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $ 0.7
million under the prospectus supplement dated November 9, 2022. Subsequent to December
31, 2022, the Company sold an additional
590,942
shares of common stock under the prospectus supplement dated November 9, 2022 for gross
proceeds of $ 1.0
million. There are currently no remaining shares registered to be sold under the 2022 Sales Agreement.
The
Company plans to secure additional capital in the future through equity or debt financings, partnerships, collaborations, or other sources
to carry out the Company’s planned development activities. If additional capital is not available when required, the Company may
need to delay or curtail its operations until such funding is received. Various internal and external factors will affect whether and
when the Company’s product candidates become approved for marketing and successful commercialization. The regulatory approval and
market acceptance of the Company’s product candidates, length of time and cost of developing and commercializing these product
candidates and/or failure of them at any stage of the approval process will materially affect the Company’s financial condition
and future operations.
Operations
since inception have consisted primarily of organizing the Company, securing financing, developing its technologies through performing
research and development and conducting preclinical studies. The Company faces risks associated with companies whose products are in
development. These risks include the need for additional financing to complete its research and development, achieving its research and
development objectives, defending its intellectual property rights, recruiting and retaining skilled personnel, and dependence on key
members of management

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a.
Basis of presentation
The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information as found in the Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”)
and Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). In the opinion of management,
the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments (which consist primarily
of accruals, estimates and assumptions that impact the unaudited interim financial statements) considered necessary to present fairly
the Company’s financial position as of December 31, 2022 and its results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements presented herein do not contain the required disclosures
under U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the annual audited financial statements and related
notes of Sonnet as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2022.
b.
Consolidation
The
interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
c.
Use of estimates
The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates and assumptions
reflected in these interim consolidated financial statements include the accrual of research and development expenses. Estimates and
assumptions are periodically reviewed in-light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in
the period in which they become known. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates.
d.
Reclassifications
Certain
amounts from the prior period have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.
e.
Incentive tax receivable
Subsidiary
is eligible to participate in an Australian research and development tax incentive program. As part of this program, Subsidiary is
eligible to receive a cash refund from the Australian Taxation Office for a percentage of the research and development costs
expended by Subsidiary in Australia.
The
cash refund is available to eligible companies with annual aggregate revenues of less than $20.0 million (Australian) during the
reimbursable period.
The Company estimates the amount of cash refund it expects to receive related to the Australian research
and development tax incentive program and records the incentive when it is probable (i) the Company will comply with relevant
conditions of the program and (ii) the incentive will be received. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s estimate of the
amount of cash refund it expects to receive for eligible spending related to the Australian research and development tax incentive
program was $ 1.3
million. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, $ 0.3
million and
nil , respectively, for the cash refund expected to
be received was recorded as a reduction of research and development expense. In January 2023, the Company received $ 1.1
million from the Australian government
related to eligible research and development expenses for the year ended September 30, 2022.

Consolidated Financial Statements
f.
Property and equipment
Property
and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Expenditures
for repairs and maintenance that do not extend the estimated useful life or improve an asset are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement
or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization of assets disposed of are removed from the accounts, and any
resulting gain or loss is included in the consolidated statement of operations.
g.
Collaboration revenue
Collaboration
arrangements may contain multiple components, which may include (i) licenses; (ii) research and development activities; and (iii) the
manufacturing and supply of certain materials. Payments pursuant to these arrangements may include non-refundable payments, upfront payments,
milestone payments upon the achievement of significant regulatory and development events, sales milestones and royalties on product sales.
The amount of variable consideration is constrained until it is probable that the revenue is not at a significant risk of reversal in
a future period.
In
determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations under a collaboration arrangement,
the Company performs the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of
whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are capable of being distinct; (iii) measurement
of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance
obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue as the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
The
Company applies significant judgment when evaluating whether contractual obligations represent distinct performance obligations, allocating
transaction price to performance obligations within a contract, determining when performance obligations have been met, and assessing
the recognition of variable consideration. When consideration is received prior to the Company completing its performance obligation
under the terms of a contract, a contract liability is recorded as deferred income. Deferred income expected to be recognized as revenue
within the twelve months following the balance sheet date is classified as a current liability. In May 2021, the Company entered into
a License Agreement (the “New Life Agreement”) with New Life. See Note 5 for further discussion of the New Life Agreement.
h.
Research and development expense
Research
and development expenses include all direct and indirect costs associated with the development of the Company’s biopharmaceutical
products. These expenses include personnel costs, consulting fees, and payments to third parties for research, development, and manufacturing
services. These costs are charged to expense as incurred.
At
the end of the reporting period, the Company compares payments made to third-party service providers to the estimated progress toward
completion of the related project, based on the measure of progress as defined in the contract. Factors the Company considers in preparing
the estimates include costs incurred by the service provider, milestones achieved, and other criteria related to the efforts of its service
providers. Such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Depending on the timing of payment to the
service providers and the progress that the Company estimates has been made as a result of the service provided, the Company will record
a prepaid expense or accrued liability relating to these costs. Upfront milestone payments made to third parties who perform research
and development services on the Company’s behalf are expensed as services are rendered. Contingent development or regulatory milestone
payments are recognized upon the related resolution of such contingencies.

i.
Reverse stock split
On
September 16, 2022, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, which effected a
1-for-14 reverse stock split
of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares
of common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 14 shares of common stock issued and outstanding was converted into one
share of common stock. The reverse stock split affected all stockholders uniformly and did not alter any stockholder’s percentage
interest in the Company’s equity. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who
would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of common stock were instead entitled to receive a proportional cash payment. The reverse
stock split did not change the par value or authorized number of shares of common stock. All common share and per share amounts presented
in the interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock
split.
j.
Net loss per share
Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each
period (and potential shares of common stock that are exercisable for little or no consideration). Included in basic weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are the Series B warrants with
an exercise price of $ 0.0014
per share.
Diluted
loss per share includes the effect, if any, from the potential exercise or conversion of securities such as common stock warrants and
stock options which would result in the issuance of incremental shares of common stock. For diluted net loss per share, the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock is the same for basic net loss per share due to the fact that when a net loss exists, dilutive securities
are not included in the calculation as the impact is anti-dilutive.
The
following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of diluted shares of common stock outstanding as they
would be anti-dilutive:

adopted
In
May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04,
Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock
Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s Accounting
for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options . The amendments in ASU 2021-04 provide
guidance to clarify and reduce diversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified
written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. The adoption of ASU 2021-04
on October 1, 2022 did not have any impact on the interim consolidated financial statements.

Commitments and Contingencies
Legal
proceedings
From
time to time, the Company is a party to various lawsuits, claims, and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its
business. While the outcomes of these matters are uncertain, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters
will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
License
agreements
In
July 2012, the Company entered into a Discovery Collaboration Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with XOMA (US) LLC
(“XOMA”), pursuant to which XOMA granted to the Company a non-exclusive, non-transferable license and/or right to use certain
materials, technologies and related information related to discovery, optimization and development of antibodies and related proteins
and to develop and commercialize products thereunder. The Company is obligated to make contingent milestone payments to XOMA totaling
$ 3.8
million on a product-by-product basis upon the achievement of certain development and approval milestones related to a product.
The Company has also agreed to pay XOMA low single-digit royalties on net sales of products sold by the Company. Royalties on each product
are payable on a country-by-country basis until the later of (i) a specified period of time after the first commercial sale, and (ii)
the date of expiration of the last valid claim in the last-to-expire of the issued patents covered by the Collaboration Agreement. The
first milestone was achieved in April 2022, at which time the Company incurred a $ 0.5
million license fee which was recorded as acquired
in-process research and development.

Notes to Unaudited Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements
In
August 2015, the Company entered into a License Agreement (the “ARES License Agreement”) with Ares Trading, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Merck KGaA (“ARES”). Under the terms of the ARES License Agreement, ARES has granted the Company a sublicensable,
exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license on proprietary patents to research, develop, use and commercialize products using atexakin
alfa (“Atexakin”), a low dose formulation of human IL-6 in peripheral neuropathies and vascular complications. Pursuant to
the ARES License Agreement, the Company will pay ARES high single-digit royalties on net sales of products sold by the Company. Royalties
are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of (i) a specified period of time after the first commercial
sale in such country, and (ii) the last date on which such product is covered by a valid claim in such country.
In
January 2019, the Company entered into a Frame Services and License Agreement (the “Cellca Agreement”) with Sartorius Stedim
Cellca GMBH (“Cellca”), pursuant to which Cellca has granted the Company a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-transferable
license to develop, manufacture or have manufactured, use, sell, import, export and/or otherwise commercialize product based on Cellca’s
work to generate a specified transfected cell line and develop an upstream production process for such cell line. The Cellca Agreement
is effective unless terminated by either party by giving six months notice, or by giving 14 days notice if terminated for good cause.
The Company is obligated to make milestone payments to Cellca totaling up to $ 0.7
million upon the achievement of certain development
and approval milestones if the Buy-Out Option is not exercised.
The Company has a Buy-Out Option that will be effective between the time
of completion of a clinical trial and the receipt of regulatory approval for commercialization of product. The cost to exercise the Buy-Out
Option increases on each anniversary of the commencement date of the Buy-Out Option Period, and ranges from $ 0.1
million to $ 0.6
million.
The cost to exercise the Buy-Out Option will replace the $ 0.6
million contingent milestone payment due upon final regulatory approval.
The first milestone was achieved in April 2022, at which time the Company incurred a $ 0.1
million license fee which was recorded as acquired
in-process research and development.
In
October 2021, the Company entered into a Non-Exclusive License Agreement (the “Brink Agreement”) with Brink Biologics Inc.
(“Brink”), pursuant to which Brink has granted the Company a non-exclusive, non-transferable license and limited right to

Collaboration Revenue
Under
the New Life Agreement, the Company granted New Life an exclusive license (with the right to sublicense) to develop and commercialize
pharmaceutical preparations containing a specific recombinant human IL-6, SON-080 (the “Compound”) (such preparations, the
“Products”) for the prevention, treatment or palliation of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in humans (the “DPN Field”)
in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Myanmar, Lao PDR and Cambodia (the “Exclusive Territory”).
New Life had the option to expand (1) the field of the exclusive license to include the prevention, treatment or palliation of chemotherapy-induced
peripheral neuropathy in humans (the “CIPN Field”), which option was non-exclusive and expired on December 31, 2021; and/or
(2) the territorial scope of the license to include the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong and/or India, which option was exclusive
and expired on December 31, 2021.
The
Company will retain all rights to manufacture Compounds and Products anywhere in the world. The Company and New Life shall enter into
a follow-on supply agreement pursuant to which the Company shall supply to New Life Products for development and commercialization thereof
in the DPN Field in the Exclusive Territory on terms to be negotiated by the parties. The Company will also assist in transferring certain
preclinical and clinical development know-how that is instrumental in New Life’s ability to benefit from the license.
New
Life will bear the cost of, and be responsible for, among other things, conducting clinical studies and additional non-clinical studies
and other developmental and regulatory activities for and commercializing Products in the DPN Field in the Exclusive Territory.
New
Life paid the Company a $ 0.5
million non-refundable upfront cash payment in August 2020 upon executing a letter of intent to negotiate
a license agreement and a $ 0.5
million non-refundable upfront cash payment in June 2021 in connection with the execution of the New Life
Agreement.
New Life is also obligated to pay a non-refundable deferred license fee of an additional $ 1.0
million at the time of the satisfaction
of certain milestones, as well as potential additional milestone payments to the Company of up to $ 19.0
million subject to the achievement
of certain development and commercialization milestones. In addition, during the Royalty Term (as defined below), New Life is obligated
to pay the Company tiered double-digit royalties ranging from
12 %
to
30 %
based on annual net sales of Products in the Exclusive Territory.
The “Royalty Term” means, on a Product-by-Product and a country-by-country basis in the Exclusive Territory, the period commencing
on the date of the first commercial sale (subject to certain conditions) of such Product in such country in the Exclusive Territory and
continuing until New Life ceases commercialization of such Product in the DIPN Field.
The
New Life Agreement will remain in effect on a Product-by-Product, country-by-country basis and will expire upon the expiration of the
Royalty Term for the last-to-expire Product in the last-to-expire country, subject to (i) each party’s early termination rights
including for material breach or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party and (ii) the Company’s Buy Back Right and New Life’s
Give Back Right (as defined below).
In
addition, New Life granted to the Company an exclusive option to buy back the rights granted by the Company to New Life and the Company
granted New Life the right to give back the rights with respect to Products in the DPN Field in one or more countries in the Exclusive
Territory on terms to be agreed upon, which options will expire upon the initiation of a Phase III Trial for the applicable Product.

Revenue
recognition
The
Company first assessed the New Life Agreement under ASC 808,
Collaborative Arrangements
(“ASC 808”) to determine whether
the New Life Agreement or units of accounts within the New Life Agreement represent a collaborative arrangement based on the risks and
rewards and activities of the parties. The Company applied relevant guidance from ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(“ASC 606”) to evaluate the appropriate accounting for the collaborative arrangement with New Life. In accordance with this
guidance, the Company identified the following obligations under the arrangement: (i) license to develop, market, import, use and commercialize
the Product in the Field in the Exclusive Territory (the “License”); and (ii) transfer of know-how and clinical development
and regulatory activities (“R&D Activities”). The options to expand the CIPN Field and territory as well as the future
supply agreement represent optional purchases, which are accounted for as separate contracts. The Company evaluated these separate contracts
and did not identify any material right to be present. The Company determined that License and the R&D services are not distinct
from each other and therefore combined these material promises into a single performance obligation.
The
Company determined the initial transaction price of the single performance obligation to be $ 1.0
million, as the future development and
commercialization milestones, which represent variable consideration, are subject to constraint at inception. At the end of each subsequent
reporting period, the Company will reevaluate the probability of achievement of the future development and commercialization milestones
subject to constraint and, if necessary, will adjust its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments will be recorded
on a cumulative catch-up basis. For the sales-based royalties, the Company will recognize revenue when the related sales occur.
Collaboration
revenue from the single performance obligation is being recognized over the estimated performance of the R&D services. The Company
recognized $ 37,255
and $ 0.1
million of collaboration revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Share-Based Compensation
In
April 2020, the Company adopted the 2020 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). There were no shares available for issuance
under the Plan as of December 31, 2022. On January 1, 2023, the total number of shares authorized under the Plan increased to
318,561 .
The Plan increases the amount of shares issuable under the Plan by four percent of the outstanding shares of common stock on January
1, each year. The Plan permits the granting of share-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock units and awards, stock
appreciation rights and other types of awards as deemed appropriate, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Plan. The terms
of the awards are determined by the Company’s Board of Directors.
Restricted
stock units
In
July of 2020,
46,703
restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were granted, 50% of which vested on April 2, 2021 and the remaining
50% vested on April 2, 2022.
In March of 2021, an additional
3,357
RSUs were granted, 50% of which vested on March 25, 2022 and the remaining
50% vest on March 25, 2023.
In December of 2021,
46,478
RSUs were granted, 100% of which vest on January 1, 2023.
In December of 2022,
172,672
RSUs were granted, 100% of which vest on January 1, 2024.
Any unvested RSUs will be forfeited upon termination of services. The
fair value of an RSU is equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. RSU expense is amortized

Overview
Sonnet
BioTherapeutics Holdings, Inc. (“Sonnet,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”),
is a clinical stage, oncology-focused biotechnology company with a proprietary platform for innovating biologic medicines of single-
or bi-specific action. Known as F H AB™ (Fully Human Albumin Binding), the technology utilizes a fully human single chain
antibody fragment that binds to and “hitch-hikes” on human serum albumin for transport to target tissues. We designed the
construct to improve drug accumulation in specific tissues, as well as to extend the duration of activity in the body. F H AB
development candidates are produced in a mammalian cell culture, which enables glycosylation, thereby reducing the risk of immunogenicity.
We believe our F H AB technology, for which we received a U.S. patent in June 2021, is a distinguishing feature of our biopharmaceutical
platform that is well suited for future drug development across a range of human disease areas, including in oncology, autoimmune, pathogenic,
inflammatory, and hematological conditions.
Our
current internal pipeline development activities are focused on cytokines, a class of cell signaling peptides that, among other important
functions, serve as potent immunomodulatory agents. Working both independently and synergistically, specific cytokines have shown the
ability to modulate the activation and maturation of immune cells that fight cancer and pathogens. However, because they do not preferentially
accumulate in specific tissues and are quickly eliminated from the body, the conventional approach to achieving a treatment effect with
cytokine therapy typically requires the administration of high and frequent doses. This can result in a reduced treatment effect accompanied
by the potential for systemic toxicity, which poses challenges to the therapeutic application of this class of drugs.
Our
lead proprietary asset, SON-1010, is a fully human version of Interleukin 12 (“IL-12”), covalently linked to the F H AB
construct, for which we intend to pursue clinical development in solid tumor indications, including non-small cell lung cancer and head
and neck cancer. We have completed a nonhuman primate (“NHP”) GLP toxicity study and have successfully manufactured drug
product for clinical use. In March 2022, the FDA cleared our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for SON-1010. This
allowed us to initiate a U.S. clinical trial (SB101) in oncology patients with solid tumors during the second calendar quarter of 2022.
In September 2021, we created a wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, SonnetBio Pty Ltd, for the purpose of conducting certain clinical
trials. We received approval and initiated an Australian clinical study (SB102) of SON-1010 in healthy volunteers during the third calendar
quarter of 2022.
Initial safety and tolerability data from the SB101 and SB102 studies was obtained
during the calendar fourth quarter of 2022, and additional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from both studies is expected during
the second calendar quarter of 2023.
20
We
acquired the global development rights to our most advanced compound, SON-080, a fully human version of Interleukin 6 (“IL-6”),
in April 2020 through our acquisition of the outstanding shares of Relief Therapeutics SA. We are advancing SON-080 in target indications
of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (“CIPN”) and Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (“DPN”). We received
approval to initiate an ex-U.S. Phase 1b/2a study with SON-080 in CIPN. This study could yield initial clinical safety data during the
first half of 2023. Pursuant to a license agreement we entered with New Life Therapeutics Pte, Ltd. (“New Life”) of Singapore
in May 2021, we and New Life will be jointly responsible for developing SON-080 in DPN.
The objective
will be to evaluate the data and potentially initiate a Phase 2 study in the second half of 2023, once the CIPN safety data has been
evaluated.
SON-1210
(“IL12-F H AB-IL15”), our lead bi-specific construct, combines F H AB with fully human IL-12 and fully
human Interleukin 15 (“IL-15”). This compound is being developed for solid tumor indications, including colorectal cancer.
An NHP study was completed in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022, and Sonnet expects to initiate the regulatory authorization process
in the first half of 2023. Manufacturing and drug supply are secured with a lyophilized drug product formulation being prepared during
the first calendar quarter of 2023, which is expected to be suitable for first-in-human clinical trials.
SON-1410
(IL18-FHAB-IL12) is a bispecific combination of Interleukins 18 (IL-18) and 12 (IL-12) for solid tumor cancers. Cell line development
and process development are ongoing, with early experimental drug supply suitable for formulation and analytical method development activities,
in addition to small quantities for use in early development proof-of-concept in vitro studies. Process development activities will continue
through 2023, with the potential to generate drug suitable for initial
in vivo
mouse studies by the end of the 2023 calendar year.
We
have completed sequence confirmation for SON-3015 (anti-IL6-F H AB-anti-TGFβ). Early stage bi-specific drug has been generated
and is being stored for future use in in vivo mice studies. Sonnet has elected to place the SON-3015 development program on hold for
expense reduction purposes.
We
have incurred recurring operating losses and negative cash flows since inception. Our ability to generate product or licensing revenue
sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of
our current or future product candidates. Our net losses were $5.5 million and $6.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash of $1.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and
increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially
in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we:
●
conduct
additional clinical trials for product candidates;
●
continue
to discover and develop additional product candidates;
●
acquire
or in-license other product candidates and technologies;
●
maintain,
expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
●
hire
additional clinical, scientific and commercial personnel;
●
establish
a commercial manufacturing source and secure supply chain capacity sufficient to provide commercial quantities of any product candidates
for which we may obtain regulatory approval;
●
seek
regulatory approval for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
●
establish
a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and
●
add
operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and
planned future commercialization efforts, as well as to support our operation as a public reporting company.
21
We
will not generate revenue from product sales, if any, unless and until we receive licensing revenue and/or successfully complete clinical
development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates
and do not enter into a commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization
capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. We will continue to incur significant costs associated with operating
as a public company.
As
a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such
time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity,
debt financings or other capital sources, which may include collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may
not be able to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all.
If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate
the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions.
Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased
expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not
become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable
to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate operations.
Since
our inception in 2015, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to organizing and staffing the Company,
business planning, raising capital, acquiring or discovering product candidates and securing related intellectual property rights and
conducting discovery, research and development activities for product candidates. We do not have any products approved for sale and have
not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations to date primarily with proceeds from sales of common stock,
warrants and proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt.
Recent
Events
On
October 31, 2022, we announced a collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen) where
in vitro
and
in vivo
efficacy
of SON-1010 (IL12-F H AB), SON-1210 (IL12-F H AB-IL15) and SON-1410 (IL18-F H AB-IL12) will be evaluated in
combination with certain Janssen proprietary cell therapy assets. The agreement was facilitated by Johnson & Johnson Innovation.
Under the terms, Sonnet shall supply the three referenced compounds for use in head-to-head studies. If successful and subject to provisions
of the agreement, Sonnet could seek an expanded collaboration.
On
January 9, 2023, we announced a clinical collaboration with Roche for the clinical evaluation of SON-1010 with Roche’s atezolizumab.
Under the terms of the Master Clinical Trial and Supply Agreement (MCSA), along with ancillary Quality and Safety Agreements, Sonnet
and Roche will study the safety and efficacy of the combination of SON-1010 and atezolizumab in a platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC)
patient setting. Further, the companies would provide SON-1010 and atezolizumab, respectively, for use in the Phase 1b/Phase 2a safety
and efficacy study.

Components
of Results of Operations
Collaboration
Revenue
Collaboration
revenue is currently earned from the license arrangement entered into with New Life in May 2021, which granted New Life rights to an
exclusive license (with the right to sublicense) to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical preparations containing a specific recombinant
human IL-6, SON-080 (the “Compound”) (such preparations, the “Products”) for the prevention, treatment or palliation
of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in humans (the “DPN Field”) in the Exclusive Territory. We identified the following obligations
under the arrangement: (i) License to develop, market, import, use and commercialize the Product in the Field in the Exclusive Territory
(the “License”); and (ii) transfer of know-how and clinical development and regulatory activities (“R&D Activities”).
We determined that the License and the R&D Activities are not distinct from each other and, therefore, combined these material promises
into a single performance obligation. Under this agreement, we received upfront cash payments totaling $1.0 million, which were fully
allocated to the single performance obligation and are being recognized over the estimated performance period of R&D services.
Operating
Expenses
Research
and Development Expenses
Research
and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates.
We expense research and development costs as incurred and such costs include:
●
employee-related
expenses, including salaries, share-based compensation and related benefits, for employees engaged in research and development functions;
●
expenses
incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with third
parties, such as consultants and clinical research organizations;
●
the
cost of manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including under agreements with third
parties, such as consultants and contract manufacturing organizations;
●
facilities,
depreciation and other expenses, which include direct or allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance;
●
costs
related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and
●
payments
made under third-party licensing agreements.
We
recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided
by our service providers. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with their personnel to identify
services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the
service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services
to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Such amounts are recognized
as an expense when the goods have been delivered or the services have been performed.
23
Our
direct research and development expenses consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to outside consultants, CROs, CMOs and
research laboratories in connection with preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities.
Our direct research and development expenses also include fees incurred under third-party license agreements. We do not allocate employee
costs and costs associated with discovery efforts, laboratory supplies and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs,
to specific product candidates because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and as such, are not separately classified.
We use internal resources primarily to conduct its research and discovery as well as for managing preclinical development, process development,
manufacturing and clinical development activities. These employees work across multiple programs and therefore, we do not track costs
by product candidate.
We
expect our research and development expense will increase for the foreseeable future as we attempt to advance development of our product
candidates. The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or
know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our current pipeline
or any future product candidates we may develop due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with clinical development, including
risk and uncertainties related to:
●
the
timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;
●
the
number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs that we decide to pursue;
●
our
ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;
●
establishing
an appropriate safety profile with investigational new drug-enabling studies;
●
successful
patient enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of, clinical trials;
●
the
successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any
comparable foreign regulatory authority;
●
the
receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
●
the
timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
●
our
ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements;
●
establishing
agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if any of our
product candidates is approved;
●
development
and timely delivery of clinical-grade and commercial-grade drug formulations that can be used in our clinical trials and for commercial
launch;
●
obtaining,
maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
●
launching
commercial sales of product candidates, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;
●
maintaining
a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval; and
●
the
potential impact of COVID-19 on operations which may affect among other things, the timing of clinical trials, availability of raw
materials, and the ability to access and secure testing facilities.
A
change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates could significantly change
the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval
for any of our product candidates.

General
and Administrative Expenses
General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including share-based compensation, in executive,
finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as
well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, accounting, and audit services.
Our
general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support continued research activities
and development of product candidates. We will continue to incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director
and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company.
Foreign
Exchange Gain
Foreign
exchange gain consists of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

Collaboration
Revenue
We
recognized $37,255 of revenue related to the New Life Agreement during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $0.1 million
during the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease of $0.1 million was due to a delay in timing in the performance of R&D
services.
Research
and Development Expenses
Research
and development expenses were $3.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $4.3 million for the three months
ended December 31, 2021. The decrease of $0.5 million was primarily due to the establishment of cost savings by transitioning product
development activities to cost advantaged locations such as India and Australia and by reducing expenditures on tertiary programs such
as SON-3015, which has been placed on a development hold, as well as a decrease in share-based compensation expense.
25
General
and Administrative Expenses
General
and administrative expenses were $1.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $2.1 million for the three months
ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease of
$0.2 million
relates
primarily to a decrease in share-based compensation expense and consulting expense related to investor relations.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
We
have funded operations to date primarily with proceeds from sales of common stock, warrants and proceeds from the issuance of convertible
debt. We will likely offer additional securities for sale in response to market conditions or other circumstances if we believe such
a plan of financing is required to advance our business plans and is in the best interests of our stockholders. There is no certainty
that equity or debt financing will be available in the future or that it will be at acceptable terms and at this time, it is not possible
to predict the outcome of these matters.
We
have incurred significant net losses of $5.5 million and $6.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
We expect to continue to incur significant operational expenses and net losses in the upcoming 12 months and beyond. Our net losses may
fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, depending on the stage and complexity of our R&D studies and related
expenditures, the receipt of additional payments on the licensing of our technology, if any, and the receipt of payments under any current
or future collaborations we may enter into.
We
have evaluated whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. We believe our cash of $1.7 million at December 31, 2022, together with the $1.0 million of gross proceeds
received from the sale of common stock pursuant to the 2022 Sales Agreement (as defined below) subsequent to December 31, 2022 and an
estimated $13.5 million in net proceeds received from an underwritten public offering in February 2023 will fund our projected operations
into February 2024. Substantial additional financing will be needed by us to fund our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The
following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:

Operating
Activities
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, we used $5.9 million of cash in operating activities which was primarily attributable to our
net loss of $5.5 million and a net $0.5 million decrease in incentive tax receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts
payable and accrued expenses, primarily related to research and development efforts. This amount was offset by $0.1 million of share-based
compensation expense and $0.1 million of acquired in-process research and development.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2021, we used $8.1 million of cash in operating activities which was primarily attributable to our
net loss of $6.2 million and $2.2 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, primarily related to research and development
efforts. This amount was offset by $0.3 million of share-based compensation expense and $0.1 million of acquired in-process research
and development.
26
Investing
Activities
During
the three months ended December 31, 2021, we used $0.1 million for the purchase of acquired in-process research and development.
Financing
Activities
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was $4.6 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds
from the sale of common stock.
Funding
Requirements
We
expect to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance preclinical activities
and clinical trials of product candidates in development. In addition, we expect to continue to incur costs associated with operating
as a public company. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:
●
the
scope, number, initiation, progress, timing, costs, design, duration, any potential delays, and results of clinical trials and nonclinical
studies for our current or future product candidates;
●
the
clinical development plans we establish for these product candidates;
●
the
number and characteristics of product candidates and programs that we develop or may in-license;
●
the
outcome, timing and cost of regulatory reviews, approvals or other actions to meet regulatory requirements established by the FDA
and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to
require that we perform more studies for our product candidates than those that we currently expect;
●
our
ability to obtain marketing approval for product candidates;
●
the
cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights covering our product candidates;
●
our
ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the cost of defending intellectual
property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us or our product candidates;
●
the
cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale outsourced manufacturing activities with respect to product candidates;
●
our
ability to establish and maintain licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements on favorable terms and whether and to what extent
we retain development or commercialization responsibilities under any new licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement;
●
the
cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory
approval in regions where we choose to commercialize our products on our own;
27
●
the
success of any other business, product or technology that we acquire or in which we invest;
●
the
costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in businesses, product candidates and technologies;
●
our
need and ability to hire additional management and scientific and medical personnel;
●
the
costs to operate as a public company in the United States, including the need to implement additional financial and reporting systems
and other internal systems and infrastructure for our business;
●
market
acceptance of our product candidates, to the extent any are approved for commercial sale;
●
the
effect of competing technological and market developments; and
●
the
potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical trials and operations.
Until
such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity
offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties.
To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of ours
may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the
rights of our stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive
covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring
dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third
parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or
grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings
or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate product development or future commercialization efforts,
sell off assets, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market.
February
2023 Offering
On
February 10, 2023, the Company closed a public offering of common stock and certain warrants through Chardan Capital Markets, LLC and
EF Hutton, division of Benchmark Investments LLC as underwriters, for estimated net proceeds of $13.5 million through the issuance and
sale of 11,664,888 shares of its common stock and, to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,224,000 shares of common stock,
and accompanying common warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 27,777,776 shares of its common stock (the “February Offering”).
Each share of common stock and pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of common stock was sold together with a common warrant to purchase
two shares of common stock. The public offering price of each share of common stock and accompanying common warrant was $1.08 and $1.0799
for each pre-funded warrant and accompanying common warrant. The pre-funded warrants are immediately exercisable at a price of $0.0001
per share of common stock. The common warrants are immediately exercisable at a price of $1.08 per share of common stock, expire five
years from the date of issuance and contain an alternative cashless exercise provision whereby, subject to certain conditions, a warrant
may be exercised in a cashless transaction for shares of common stock at the rate of half a share of common stock per full share otherwise issuable
upon a cash exercise.
At-the-Market
Offering of Common Stock
We
entered into an At-the-Market Sales Agreement with BTIG, LLC (“BTIG”) on August 15, 2022 (the “2022 Sales Agreement”).
Pursuant to the 2022 Sales Agreement, we may offer and sell, from time to time, through BTIG, as sales agent and/or principal, shares
of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $25.0 million, subject to certain limitations on the amount of common
stock that may be offered and sold by us set forth in the 2022 Sales Agreement. Due to the offering limitations applicable to us under
General Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3 and our public float as of August 15, 2022, and in accordance with the terms of the 2022 Sales
Agreement, we could offer shares having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $6.1 million pursuant to the prospectus supplement dated
August 15, 2022, filed in connection with the 2022 Sales Agreement. As of November 9, 2022, we had sold an aggregate of 2,477,287 shares
of common stock for gross proceeds of $6.1 million, and we filed a prospectus supplement dated November 9, 2022 registering the offer
and sale of shares of our common stock for an aggregate offering price of up to an additional $1.7 million pursuant to the 2022 Sales
Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, we have sold an aggregate of 603,737 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $0.7 million under
the prospectus supplement dated November 9, 2022. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we sold an additional 590,942 shares of common stock
under the prospectus supplement dated November 9, 2022 for gross proceeds of $1.0 million. There are currently no remaining shares registered
to be sold under the 2022 Sales Agreement.

In
addition to the contracts with payment commitments that we have reflected in the table above, we have entered into other contracts in
the normal course of business with certain CROs, CMOs and other third-parties for preclinical research studies and testing, clinical
trials and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and are cancellable upon prior notice
and as a result, are not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments above. Payments due upon cancellation consist
only of payments for services provided and expenses incurred, including non-cancellable obligations to our service providers, up to the
date of cancellation.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our
management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to
the accrual for research and development expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While
our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to the interim consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
29
Research
and Development Expenses
Research
and development expenses include all direct and indirect costs associated with the development of our biopharmaceutical products. These
expenses include personnel costs, consulting fees, and payments to third parties for research, development and manufacturing services.
These costs are charged to expense as incurred.
At
the end of each reporting period, we compare payments made to third-party service providers to the estimated progress toward completion
of the related project, based on the measure of progress as defined in the contract. Factors we consider in preparing the estimates include
costs incurred by the service provider, milestones achieved, and other criteria related to the efforts of our service providers. Such
estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Depending on the timing of payment to the third-party service
providers and the progress we estimate has been made as a result of the service provided, we will record a prepaid expense or accrued
liability related to these costs. Contingent development or regulatory milestone payments are recognized upon the related resolution
of such contingencies. As of December 31, 2022, we did not make any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and
development expenses.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”)) as of December 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this report
on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and our Chief
Financial Officer (principal financial officer) have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable
assurance level at December 31, 2022.
Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements
may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns
can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. Controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the above objectives have been met.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
