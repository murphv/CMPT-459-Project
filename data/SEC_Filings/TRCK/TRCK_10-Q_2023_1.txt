TRACK GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
( 1 ) BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information of Track Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, the “ Company ” or “ Track Group ”) has been prepared in accordance with the Instructions to Form
10 -Q and Article
8
of Regulation S- X
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“ SEC ”). Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“ GAAP ”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, the accompanying interim consolidated financial information contains all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of
December 31, 2022,
and results of its operations for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10 -K for the year ended
September 30, 2022,
filed with the SEC on
December 16, 2022.
The results of operations for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
may
not
be indicative of the results for the fiscal year ending
September 30, 2023.
As of
December 31, 2022
and
September 30, 2022,
the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 306,182,505
and $ 306,218,889 , respectively. The Company had net income of $ 36,384
and a net loss of $( 305,322 ) for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021,
respectively. The Company also has $ 42,864,000
of debt maturing in
July 2024
and
six
notes payable maturing between
January 2, 2024
and
February 17, 2025
related to the construction of
two
monitoring centers related to a new contract, with outstanding balances due for the
six
notes totaling $ 757,925
at
December 31, 2022 ( See Note
19 ). The Company’s ability to return to profitable operations is dependent upon generating a level of revenue adequate to support its cost structure, which it achieved on an operating basis in the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2021
and was close to achieving in the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2022
excluding the approximate $ 1.7
million asset impairment. In addition, the Company needs to resolve its largest debt obligation which matures on
July 1, 2024.
Management has evaluated the significance of these conditions and has determined that the Company can meet its operating obligations for a reasonable period of time. The Company expects to fund operations using cash on hand and through operational cash flows through the upcoming
twelve
months.
( 2 ) PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Track Group, Inc. and its active subsidiaries, Track Group Analytics Limited, Track Group Americas, Inc., Track Group International LTD., and Track Group - Chile SpA. All inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
( 3 ) RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“ FASB ”) or other standard setting bodies, which are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In
January 2017,
the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ ASU ”)
2017 - 04,
“ Intangibles
–
Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ” (“ ASU
2017 - 04 ”). ASU
2017 - 04
simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the
second
step of the
two -step impairment test. The amendment requires an entity to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. ASU
2017 - 04
became effective for accelerated filing companies for annual periods or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2019,
and all other entities should adopt the amendments in ASU
2017 - 04
for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2022.
The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after
January 1, 2017.
The Company will adopt ASU
2017 - 04
in fiscal year
2024.
The Company does
not
anticipate that this adoption will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
In
June 2016,
the FASB issued ASU
2016 - 13,
“ Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ” (“ ASU
2016 - 03 ”). ASU
2016 - 13
adds a current expected credit loss (“ CECL ”) impairment model to GAAP that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Modified retrospective adoption is required with any cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. ASU
2016 - 13
became effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2019,
excluding smaller reporting entities, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2022.
The Company will adopt ASU
2016 - 13
in fiscal year
2024.
The Company does
not
expect the application of the CECL impairment model to have a significant impact on our allowance for uncollectible amounts for accounts receivable.
-
5 -
( 4 ) IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of an asset
may
not
be recoverable and in the case of goodwill, at least annually. The Company evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate possible impairment as of each balance sheet date. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. Impairment of long-lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there is an identifiable fair value that is independent of other groups of assets.
( 5 ) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting as indicated in Accounting Standards Codification (“ ASC ”) Topic
805,
“ Business Combinations ” (“ ASC
805 ”), which requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of all assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and establishes the acquisition date as the fair value measurement point. Accordingly, the Company recognizes assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including contingent assets and liabilities and non-controlling interest in the acquiree, based on fair value estimates as of the date of acquisition. In accordance with ASC
805,
the Company recognizes and measures goodwill as of the acquisition date, as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identified net assets acquired.
Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities
Pursuant to ASC
805 - 10 - 25,
if the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, but during the allowed measurement period
not
to exceed
one
year from the acquisition date, the Company retrospectively adjusts the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date, by means of adjusting the amount recognized for goodwill.
Contingent Consideration
In certain acquisitions, the Company has agreed to pay additional amounts to the seller contingent upon achievement by the acquired businesses of certain future goals, which
may
include revenue milestones, new customer accounts and earnings targets. The Company records contingent consideration based on its estimated fair value as of the date of the acquisition. The Company evaluates and adjusts the value of contingent consideration, if necessary, at each reporting period based on the progress toward and likely achievement of certain targets on which issuance of the contingent consideration is based. Any differences between the acquisition-date fair value and the changes in fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date are recognized in current period earnings until the arrangement is settled. If there is uncertainty surrounding the value of contingent consideration, then the Company’s policy is to wait until the end of the measurement period before making an adjustment.
( 6 ) ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)
Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income (loss) as currently reported under GAAP and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) considers the effects of additional economic events, such as foreign currency translation adjustments, that are
not
required to be recorded in determining net income (loss), but rather are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The Chilean Peso, New Israeli Shekel and the Canadian Dollar are used as functional currencies of the following operating subsidiaries: (i) Track Group Chile SpA; (ii) Track Group International Ltd.; and (iii) Track Group Analytics Limited, respectively. The balance sheets of all subsidiaries have been converted into United States Dollars at the prevailing exchange rate at
December 31, 2022.
( 7 ) NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE
Basic net income (loss) per common share (“ Basic EPS ”) is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income (loss) per common share (“ Diluted EPS ”) is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and the weighted-average dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. The computation of Diluted EPS does
not
assume exercise or conversion of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect.
Common share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, $ 0.0001
par value per share (“ Common Stock ”) (“ options ”) and warrants to purchase Common Stock (“ warrants ”). As of
December 31, 2022
and
2021,
there were
160,881
and
15,000
of outstanding common share equivalents that were
not
included in the computation of Diluted EPS for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021,
respectively, as their effect would be anti-dilutive.
At
December 31, 2022
all stock options and warrants had exercise prices that were above the market price of $ 0.35 , and have been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculations. At
December 31, 2021,
415,511
stock options and warrants had exercise prices that were below the market price of $ 2.28 , and have been included in the diluted earnings per share calculations.

( 8 ) REVENUE RECOGNITION
Monitoring and Other Related Services.
Monitoring services include
two
components: (i) lease contracts pursuant to which the Company provides monitoring services and lease devices to distributors or end users and the Company retains ownership of the leased device; and (ii) monitoring services purchased by distributors or end users who have previously purchased monitoring devices and opt to use the Company’s monitoring services. Sales of devices and leased GPS devices are required to use the Company’s monitoring service and both the GPS leased devices and monitoring services are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Monitoring revenue is recognized ratably over time, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of these services as they are performed. Payment due or received from the customers prior to rendering the associated services are recorded as deferred revenue.
The balance of accounts receivables at
December 31, 2022
of $ 5,782,098
includes an unbilled balance of $ 695,346
and the balance of accounts receivable at
September 30, 2022
of $ 6,236,555
includes an unbilled balance of $ 777,514 . The balance of accounts receivable at
September 30, 2021
of $ 7,163,615
includes an unbilled balance of $ 420,697 . The balances of the deferred revenue at
December 31, 2022,
September 30, 2022
and
September 30, 2021
are $ 2,010 , $ 3,299 , and $ 22,500 , respectively and were included in accrued liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognized $ 3,012
and $ 7,500
of deferred revenue in the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
December 31, 2021,
respectively.
Product Sales and Other.
The Company sells devices and replacement parts to customers under certain contracts, as well as law enforcement software licenses and maintenance, and analytical software. Revenue from the sale of devices and parts is recognized upon their transfer of control to the customer, which is generally upon delivery. Delivery is considered complete at either the time of shipment or arrival at destination, based on the agreed upon terms within the contract. Payment terms are generally
30
days from invoice date.
Multiple Element Arrangements.
The majority of our revenue transactions do
not
have multiple elements. However, on occasion, the Company
may
enter into revenue transactions that have multiple elements. These
may
include different combinations of products or services that are included in a single billable rate. These products or services are delivered over time as the customer utilizes our services. In cases where obligations in a contract are distinct and thus require separation into multiple performance obligations, revenue recognition guidance requires that contract consideration be allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The value allocated to each performance obligation is then recognized as revenue when the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct promise or bundle of promises has been met.
The standalone selling price for each performance obligation is an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the good or service. When there is only
one
performance obligation associated with a contract, the entire sale value is attributed to that obligation. When a contract contains multiple performance obligations the transaction value is
first
allocated using the observable price, which is generally a list price net of applicable discount, or the price used to sell in similar circumstances. In circumstances when a selling price is
not
directly observable, the Company will estimate the standalone selling price using information available to us.
The following table presents the Company’s revenue by geography, based on management’s assessment of available data:

( 9 ) PREPAID EXPENSE AND DEPOSITS
As of
December 31, 2022,
and
September 30, 2022,
the outstanding balance of prepaid expense and deposits was $ 736,619
and $ 769,006 , respectively. These balances are comprised largely of tax deposits, vendor deposits and other prepaid supplier expense.
( 10 ) INVENTORY
Inventory is valued at the lower of the cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the
first -in/first-out method. Net realizable value is determined based on the item selling price. Inventory is periodically reviewed in order to identify obsolete or damaged items or impaired values.
Inventory primarily consists of completed circuit boards used to manufacture new devices. Completed and shipped ReliAlert™ devices are reflected in Monitoring Equipment.  As of
December 31, 2022
and
September 30, 2022,
inventory consisted of the following:
December 31,
2022
September 30,
2022
Monitoring equipment component boards inventory
$ 747,207     $ 1,053,245
Reserve for damaged or obsolete inventory
-       -
Total inventory, net of reserves
$ 747,207     $ 1,053,245
The Company uses a
third -party fulfillment service provider. As a result of this service, the Company’s employees do
not
actively assemble new products or repair a significant amount of monitoring equipment shipped directly from suppliers. Purchases of monitoring equipment are recognized directly. Management believes this process reduces maintenance and fulfillment costs associated with inventory and monitoring equipment.
( 11 ) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment consisted of the following as of
December 31, 2022
and
September 30, 2022:

At the annual meeting of stockholders on

Plan provides for the grant of incentive options and nonqualified options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance stock units, dividend equivalents, stock payments, deferred stock, restricted stock units, other stock-based awards and performance-based awards to employees and certain non-employees who provide services to the Company in lieu of cash. A total of
500,000
shares are authorized for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the
2022
Plan.
The

Plan supersedes and replaces the Company’s
2012
Equity Compensation Plan (the “ 2012
Plan ”). As of
June 30, 2020,
the Board suspended further awards under the
2012
Plan. Any awards outstanding under the
2012
Plan will remain subject to the
2012
Plan. All shares of Common Stock remaining authorized and available for issuance under the
2012
Plan and any shares subject to outstanding awards under the
2012
Plan that subsequently expire, terminate, or are surrendered or forfeited for any reason without issuance of shares will automatically become available for issuance under our
2022
Plan.

285,000
restricted shares to members of its executive team from the

215,000
shares of Common Stock available under the
2022
Plan as of
December 31, 2022.
All Options and Warrants
The fair value of each stock option and warrant grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company recorded
no
expense for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021,
respectively, related to the issuance and vesting of outstanding options and warrants. During the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022

the Company granted
no
options or warrants under the
2012
Plan. All options and warrants outstanding under the
2012
Plan have vested and are exercisable as of
December 31, 2022.
The expected life of options (warrants) represents the period of time that the options or warrants are expected to be outstanding based on the simplified method allowed under GAAP. The expected volatility is based on the historical price volatility of the Company’s Common Stock. The risk-free interest rate represents the U.S. Treasury bill rate for the expected life of the related options (warrants). The dividend yield represents the Company’s anticipated cash dividends over the expected life of the options (warrants).

( 22 ) INCOME TAXES
The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets or liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or income tax returns. Deferred income tax assets or liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply when the differences are expected to be settled or realized. Deferred income tax assets are reviewed periodically for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided as necessary. Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities, when incurred, are classified in interest expense and income tax provision, respectively.
For the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021,
the Company incurred net income (loss) for income tax purposes of $ 36,384
and $( 305,322 ), respectively. The amount and ultimate realization of the benefits from the net operating losses is dependent, in part, upon the tax laws in effect, our future earnings, and other future events, the effects of which cannot be determined. The Company has established a valuation allowance for all deferred income tax assets
not
offset by deferred income tax liabilities due to the uncertainty of their realization. Accordingly, there is
no
benefit for income taxes in the accompanying statements of operations.
In computing income tax, we recognize an income tax provision in tax jurisdictions in which we have pre-tax income for the period and are expecting to generate pre-tax book income during the fiscal year.
( 23 ) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business. Historically, the outcome of nearly all such legal proceedings has
not ,
in the aggregate, had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Other than as set forth below, there are
no
additional pending or threatened legal proceedings at this time.
SecureAlert, Inc. v. Federal Government of Mexico (Department of the Interior).
On
March 24, 2017,
SecureAlert Inc. (a predecessor entity to Track Group, Inc. or the Company) filed a complaint before the Federal Administrative Tribunal, asserting the failure by defendants to pay claimant amounts agreed to, and due under, the Pluri Annual Contract for the Rendering of Monitoring Services of Internees, through Electric Bracelets, in the Islas Marias Penitentiary Complex dated
July 15, 2011,
entered into by and between the Organo Administrativo Desconcentrado Prevencion y Readaptacion Social (“ OADPRS ”) of the then Public Security Department, and presently, an agency of the National Security Commission of the Department of the Interior, and SecureAlert, Inc., presently Track Group, Inc. The Company’s claim amount is upwards of $ 6.0
million. Although preliminary rulings have been unfavorable to the Company, the Company’s counsel continues to review its remaining claims and analyzing its options. Based upon the fee arrangement the Company has with its counsel, we anticipate the future liabilities attributable to legal expense will be minimal.
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, through its Trustees v. International Surveillance Services Corporation .
On
January 23, 2020,
the Company was served with a summons for an Adversary Action pending against International Surveillance Services Corporation (“ ISS ”), a subsidiary of the Company, now known as Track Group – Puerto Rico Inc., in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico seeking to avoid and recover allegedly constructive fraudulent transfers and to disallow claims pursuant to United States Bankruptcy and Puerto Rican law. The allegations stem from payments made to ISS between
2014
and
2017,
which the Company believes were properly made in accordance with a contract between ISS and the government of Puerto Rico, through the Oficina de Servicios con Antelacion a Juicio, originally signed in
2011.
The Company is confident that all payments it received were earned and due under applicable law and produced documentation supporting its position in an informal document exchange with the Commonwealth on
July 6, 2020.
The parties held a mediation on
November 1, 2022
but were unable to reach an agreement but left open the possibility of additional discussions. The Company remains confident in its position and
no
accrual for a potential loss has been made, after consultation with legal counsel.

Monitoring Equipment and Other Related Services
The Company leases monitoring equipment and provides monitoring services to its customers with contract terms varying from month-to-month to several years and each daily contract price varies. Devices supplied to customers are
not
serial number unique and a single device
may
be used by multiple customers over its useful life. If a leased device is returned for repair, it will likely be replaced with a different device from a different customer or possibly a new device.
The Company’s tracking devices are considered operating leases under ASC
842
as transfer of control of the asset does
not
occur at the end of the lease, a single device is
not
specific to a customer and devices
may
be used by multiple customers throughout their life cycle. Due to the movement of devices from customer to customer, relatively few long-term contracts, the measurement of the equipment life and the present value of the equipment’s fair values would
not
be a measurement to qualify the devices as sales-type leases.
Operating lease and monitoring revenue associated with the Company’s monitoring equipment for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021

General
Our business is based on the leasing of patented tracking and monitoring solutions to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, both in the U.S. and abroad, for the electronic monitoring of offenders and offering unique data analytics services on a platform-as-a-service (“ PaaS ”) business model. Currently, the Company deploys offender-based management services that combine patented GPS tracking technologies, full-time 24/7/365 global monitoring capabilities, case management, and proprietary data analytics. The Company offers customizable tracking solutions that leverage real-time tracking data, best-practices monitoring, and analytics capabilities to create complete, end-to-end tracking solutions.
Devices
- Our devices consist principally of the ReliAlert® product line. These devices are generally leased on a daily rate basis and may be combined with our monitoring center services, proprietary software and data analytics subscription to provide an end-to-end PaaS.
ReliAlert®XC4 is our flagship GPS device, which is among the safest and most reliable monitoring devices ever made and was certified in 2020 by the Federal Communications Commission and PCS Type Certification Review Board. It is the only one-piece GPS device with patented 3-way voice communication to assist intervention efforts, now on the LTE network with increased battery life. This device includes on-board processing, secondary location technology, a 95db siren, embedded RF technology, anti-tampering capability, increased battery life and sleep mode.
ReliAlert®-XC 3 is our predecessor device which had advanced features enable agencies to effectively track offender movements and communicate directly with offenders in real-time, through a patented, on-board two/three-way voice communication technology. This device includes an enhanced GPS antenna and GPS module for higher sensitivity GPS, enhanced voice audio quality, increased battery performance of 50+ hours, 3G cellular capabilities, improved tamper sensory, and durability enhancements.
Monitoring Center Services
- Our monitoring centers provide live 24/7/365 monitoring of all alarms generated from our devices, as well as customer and technical support. Our monitoring center operators play a vital role, and as such, are staffed with highly trained, bi-lingual individuals. These operators act as an extension of agency resources receiving alarms, communicating and intervening with offenders regarding violations and interacting with supervision staff, all pursuant to agency-established protocols. The facilities have redundant power source, battery backup and triple redundancy in voice, data and IP. We have assisted in the establishment of monitoring centers for customers and local partners in the United States, Chile and other global locations.
Data Analytics Services
- Our IntelliTrack, TrackerPAL® software, IntelliTrack Mobile, TrackerPAL® Mobile, combined with our Data Analytic analysis tools, provide an integrated platform allowing case managers and law enforcement officers quick access views of an offender’s travel behavior, mapping, and inference on patterns. Our data analytics services help facilitate the discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in diverse locations and behavioral data that helps agencies reduce risks and improve decision making. Our analytics applications use various combinations of statistical analysis procedures, data and text mining and predictive modeling to proactively analyze information on community-released offenders to discover hidden relationships and patterns in their behaviors and to predict future outcomes.
Other Services
- The Company offers smartphone applications specifically designed for the criminal justice market, including a domestic violence app that creates a mobile geo-zone around a survivor and an alcohol monitoring app linked to a police-grade breathalyzer.

Business Strategy
We are committed to helping our customers improve offender rehabilitation and re-socialization outcomes through our innovative hardware, software and services. We treat our business as a service business. Although we still manufacture patented tracking technology, we see the physical goods as only a small part of the integrated offender monitoring solutions we provide. Accordingly, rather than receiving a payment just for a piece of manufactured equipment, the Company receives a recurring stream of revenue for ongoing device agnostic subscription contracts. As part of our strategy, we continue to expand our device-agnostic platform to not only collect, but also store, analyze, assess and correlate location data for both accountability and auditing reasons, as well as to use for predictive analytics and assessment of effective and emerging techniques in criminal behavior and rehabilitation. We believe a high-quality customer experience along with knowledgeable salespeople who can convey the value of our products and services greatly enhances our ability to attract and retain customers. Therefore, our strategy also includes building and expanding our own direct sales force and our third-party distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a world-class sales and post-sales support experience. In addition, we are developing related-service offerings to address adjacent market opportunities in both the public and private sectors. We believe continual investment in research and development (“ R&D ”), including smartphone applications and other monitoring services is critical to the development and sale of innovative technologies and integrated solutions today and in the future.
Critical Accounting Policies
From time to time, management reviews and evaluates certain accounting policies that are considered to be significant in determining our results of operations and financial position.
A description of the Company’s critical accounting policies that affect the preparation of the Company’s financial statements is set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on December 16, 2022. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, there have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We assess the reasonableness of our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, right of use assets, estimated useful lives, intangible assets, warranty obligations, product liability, revenue, legal matters and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience as well as available current information on a regular basis. Management uses this information to form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. We are not involved in any pending or, to our knowledge, threatened governmental proceedings, which would require curtailment of our operations because of such laws and regulations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted both the Company’s revenue and costs in the past by disrupting its operations in Chile, causing shortages within the supply chain and postponing certain sales opportunities as some government agencies delay new RFP (Request for Proposal) processes or decisions. Notwithstanding the challenges, the monitoring being performed by the Company’s significant customers across the globe have remained operational, as have key business partners providing manufacturing and call center services, and at this time the Company has not experienced unusual payment interruptions from any large customers. In addition, both our Chile office and the corporate headquarters in the greater-Chicago area have been open nearly fifteen months. However, the Company is operating in a rapidly changing environment, and the extent to which COVID-19 impacts its business, operations and financial results going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors that the Company cannot accurately predict. Those factors include: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the development of widespread testing or a vaccine; the ability of our supply chain to meet the Company’s need for equipment; the ability to sell and provide services and solutions if shelter in place restrictions and people working from home are extended to ensure employee safety; the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates and the subsequent effect on international transactions; and any closures of clients’ offices or the courts on which they rely.

Results of Operations
Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2021
Revenue
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized total revenue from operations of $8,855,691 compared to $9,595,656 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $739,965 or approximately 8%. The decrease in monitoring revenues is driven principally by fluctuations in court proceedings where active devices are assigned to customers in Illinois, California, the Bahamas and Canada, partially offset by an increase in monitoring revenues for customers in Nevada and Panama.
Product sales and other revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased to $565,909 from $125,927 in the same period in 2021, an increase of $439,982 or approximately 349%, primarily due to a periodic purchase from a partner in Saudi Arabia.
The industry in which the Company operates, as well as many other industries (automotive, consumer products and medical devices), have been impacted by the global semiconductor shortage. The availability of semiconductor parts has improved significantly in the second half of calendar 2022; however, long lead times remain with certain parts. As a result, until such time as chip manufacturers are able to meet global demand, our future operating results may be negatively impacted.
Cost of Revenue
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, cost of revenue totaled $4,675,013 compared to cost of revenue during the three months ended December 31, 2021 of $4,795,427, a decrease of $120,414 or approximately 3%. The decrease in cost of revenue was largely the result of lower depreciation and amortization costs of $90,830, lower monitoring center costs of $90,352, lower outside services costs of $48,876, partially offset by higher server costs of $40,457 and higher device repair costs of $74,797.
Depreciation and amortization included in cost of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled $773,019 and $863,849, respectively, a decrease of $90,830. These costs represent the depreciation of ReliAlert® and other monitoring devices, as well as the amortization of monitoring software and certain royalty agreements. The decrease in depreciation and amortization costs is largely due to a decrease in software amortization of our new software monitoring platform and other new software initiatives of $39,118, as well as a decrease in device depreciation expense of $51,712. Devices are depreciated over either a three- or five-year useful life. Monitoring software is amortized over a seven-year life. Royalty agreements are being amortized over a ten-year useful life. The Company believes these lives are appropriate due to changes in electronic monitoring technology and the corresponding potential for obsolescence. Management periodically assesses the useful life of the devices for appropriateness.
Gross Profit and Margin
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, gross profit totaled $4,180,678, resulting in a gross margin of approximately 47%. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, gross profit totaled $4,800,229, resulting in a gross margin of approximately 50%. The decrease in absolute gross profit of $619,551 or approximately 13% is due to lower revenue, partially offset by a decrease in certain costs of revenue.
General and Administrative Expense
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, general and administrative expense totaled $2,754,520 compared to $2,498,359 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase of $256,161 or approximately 10% in general and administrative expense resulted largely from higher bad debt costs of $139,434 due to significant credits taken in 2021, higher insurance costs of $89,814, higher stock-based compensation of $61,750, and higher payroll and payroll taxes of $116,973. These costs were offset by lower legal and professional fees of $135,204.
Selling and Marketing Expense
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, selling and marketing expense totaled $729,470 compared to $697,872 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in expense of $31,598 or approximately 5% is principally the result of higher travel and entertainment cots of $28,331 and higher payroll and taxes of $8,372, partially offset by lower trade show costs of $7,650 and lower consulting and outside service expenses of $5,229.
Research and Development Expense
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, research and development expense totaled $589,805 compared to $590,852 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The nominal decrease in expense of $1,047 was primarily due to a decrease in payroll offset by increases in consulting and outside services expenses.
-19-
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, depreciation and amortization expense totaled $247,710 compared to $416,801 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $169,091 or approximately 41%, largely due to fully amortized intangible assets.
Total Operating Expense
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, total operating expense increased to $4,321,506 compared to $4,203,884 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $117,622 or approximately 3%. The increase is principally due to the factors disclosed above.
Operating (Loss) Income
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, operating loss was ($140,828) compared to operating income of $596,345 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, a reduction of $737,173 or approximately 124%. This reduction was due to a decrease in gross profit of $619,551, which resulted from lower revenue, partially offset by a decrease in certain costs of revenue.
Other Income (Expense)
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, other income (expense) totaled income of $63,601 compared to other expense of ($587,838) for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $651,439. The increase in other income is largely due to positive currency exchange rate movements of $589,429 between the US Dollar vs. the Chilean Peso, compared to the first fiscal quarter of fiscal period of 2022, and higher interest income, net of $62,011.
Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders
The Company had net income attributable to common stockholders of $36,384 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of ($305,322) for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $341,706. This increase is due to positive currency exchange rate movements, higher interest income, partially offset by lower operating income.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company is currently self-funded through net cash provided by operating activities.
On May 19, 2020, the Company received net proceeds of $933,200 from the PPP Loan received pursuant to the PPP enacted by Congress under the CARES Act, administered by the SBA. On December 8, 2020, the Company filed the application for forgiveness with the Lender and on January 8, 2021, the Company received a notification from the Lender that the SBA remitted funds to fully repay the PPP Loan, and that the funds were utilized to pay-off and close the PPP Loan and that the PPP Loan was fully forgiven.
On October 21, 2020, the Company requested, in writing, an additional extension to the maturity date of the $30.4 million Amended Facility Agreement. On November 25, 2020, the Noteholders held a meeting to address the Company’s request and approved a new maturity date of July 1, 2024. On December 21, 2020, Conrent and the Company signed the Amended Facility, which extended the maturity date of the Amended Facility Agreement to July 1, 2024, capitalized the accrued and unpaid interest which increased the outstanding principal amount and reduced the interest rate of the Amended Facility from 8% to 4%. On March 1, 2021, Conrent completed their documentation and the updated registration process to implement these changes and the Company transferred $12,531,556 of accrued interest to the note payable for total principal of $42,931,556. Conrent forgave $67,556 of the amount due and the new Amended Facility principal and interest became $42,864,000. Interest payments were scheduled to be made on June 30 and December 31 each year, which began on June 30, 2021. We began amortizing deferred financing fees of approximately $360,000 on July 1, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, $42,864,000 of principal and $876,331 of interest was owed to Conrent.

No borrowings or sales of equity securities occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022 or during the year ended September 30, 2022.
Management will continue to seek other sources of capital, refinancing options, prepayment of debt at a discount, extending the maturity date of the debt and potentially other transactions including the exchange of some debt for an equity related security to reduce its total debt and assist in meeting all of its future obligations. While management believes it will be successful in completing one of these alternatives prior to July 2023, no assurances can be given.
Net Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities.

On November 25, 2020, the Noteholders held a meeting to address the Company’s request and approved a new maturity date of July 1, 2024.

On June 30, 2021, the Company restarted interest payments to Conrent which have been made semi-annually since that time.
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the Company borrowed approximately $1.95 million though six notes payable to fund the construction of monitoring centers in Chile required by our new contract. These six notes mature between January 2024 to February 2025 and the principal repayments on these six notes have all commenced. No additional funds were borrowed in the three months ended December 31, 2022 or borrowed in the fiscal year end September 30, 2022.
Inflation
The rise in inflation in 2021 and 2022 has adversely impacted the Company’s cost of labor, materials and other operating expenses as well.
Off-Balance Sheet Financial Arrangements
The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The Company footprint extends to a number of countries outside the United States, and we intend to continue to examine international opportunities. As a result, our revenue and results of operations are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates, transfer pricing changes, taxes and other uncertainties inherent in doing business in more than one currency. In addition, our operations are exposed to risks that are associated with changes in social, political and economic conditions in the foreign countries in which we operate, including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment, as well as, to a lesser extent, changes in United States laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment.
Foreign Currency Risks
We had $1,525,021 and $1,530,147 in foreign currency revenue from sources outside of the United States for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We made and received payments in a foreign currency during the periods indicated, which resulted in foreign exchange gain (loss) of $483,151 and $(106,278) in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Fluctuations in the exchange loss or gain in any given period are due to the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Chilean Peso and Canadian dollar which have been magnified by global matters, inflation, and the government policies established to address those issues. Changes in currency exchange rates affect the relative prices at which we sell our products and purchase goods and services. Given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on our future business, product pricing, results of operations, or financial condition. We periodically enter into small, simple forward foreign currency exchange contracts or derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes given our approximate 17% of revenue in one local currency offset by significant expenses in the same local currency. To the extent foreign sales become a more significant part of our business in the future, we may seek to implement additional strategies which make use of these or other instruments in order to minimize the effects of foreign currency exchange on our business and/or require some international customers to receive invoices and make payments in US dollars.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We have established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to the Company is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022 was completed pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms as of December 31, 2022.
Changes in Internal Controls
We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that our books and records accurately reflect our transactions and that our established policies and procedures are followed. There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our quarter ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The Company’s claim amount is upwards of $6.0 million.
