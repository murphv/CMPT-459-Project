CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INDUSTRY DATA
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These statements may be identified by such forward-looking terminology as “may,”
“should,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,”
“estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue” or the negative of these terms or other
comparable terminology. Our forward-looking statements are based on a series of expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections
about our company, are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve substantial risks and uncertainty. We may not actually
achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially
from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements. Our business and our forward-looking statements
involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties inherent in our statements regarding:
●
capital
requirements and the availability of capital to fund our growth and to service our existing debt;
●
difficulties
executing our growth strategy, including attracting new issuers and investors;
●
our
anticipated use of the net proceeds from our recent public offering;
●
economic
uncertainties and business interruptions resulting from the coronavirus COVID-19 global pandemic and its aftermath;
●
as restrictions
related to the coronavirus COVID-19 global pandemic are removed and face-to-face economic activities normalize, it may be difficult
for us to maintain the recent sales gains that we have experienced;
●
all
the risks of acquiring one or more complementary businesses, including identifying a suitable target, completing comprehensive due
diligence uncovering all information relating to the target, the financial stability of the target, the impact on our financial condition
of the debt we may incur in acquiring the target, the ability to integrate the target’s operations with our existing operations,
our ability to retain management and key employees of the target, among other factors attendant to acquisitions of small, non-public
operating companies;
●
difficulties
in increasing revenue per issuer;
●
challenges
related to hiring and training fintech employees at competitive wage rates;
●
difficulties
in increasing the average number of investments made per investor;
●
shortages
or interruptions in the supply of quality issuers;
●
our
dependence on a small number of large issuers to generate revenue;
●
negative
publicity relating to any one of our issuers;
●
competition
from other online capital portals with significantly greater resources than we have;
●
changes
in investor tastes and purchasing trends;
●
our
inability to manage our growth;
●
our
inability to maintain an adequate level of cash flow, or access to capital, to meet growth expectations;
●
changes
in senior management, loss of one or more key personnel or an inability to attract, hire, integrate and retain skilled personnel;
●
labor
shortages, unionization activities, labor disputes or increased labor costs, including increased labor costs resulting from the demand
for qualified employees;
●
our
vulnerability to increased costs of running an online portal with any cloud partner;
●
our
vulnerability to increasing labor costs;
●
the
impact of governmental laws and regulation;
●
failure
to obtain or maintain required licenses;
●
changes
in economic or regulatory conditions and other unforeseen conditions that prevent or delay the development of a secondary trading
market for shares of equity that are sold on our online portal; and
●
inadequately
protecting our intellectual property or breaches of security of confidential user information.
All
of our forward-looking statements are as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q only. In each case, actual results may differ
materially from such forward-looking information. We can give no assurance that such expectations or forward-looking statements will
prove to be correct. An occurrence of, or any material adverse change in, one or more of the risk factors or risks and uncertainties
referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or included in our other public disclosures or our other periodic reports or other
documents or filings filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) could materially
and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Except as required by law, we do not undertake
or plan to update or revise any such forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in plans, assumptions, estimates or
projections or other circumstances affecting such forward-looking statements occurring after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, even if such results, changes or circumstances make it clear that any forward-looking information will not be realized. Any public
statements or disclosures by us following this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that modify or impact any of the forward-looking statements
contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will be deemed to modify or supersede such statements in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q.
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include market data and certain industry data and forecasts, which we may obtain from internal company
surveys, market research, consultant surveys, publicly available information, reports of governmental agencies and industry publications,
articles and surveys. Industry surveys, publications, consultant surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained
therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed.
While we believe that such studies and publications are reliable, we have not independently verified market and industry data from third-party
sources.

NETCAPITAL INC.
NOTES TO
UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1–
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying
unaudited condensed financial statements of Netcapital Inc. (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results
for the three- and nine-month periods ended January 31, 2023, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for
the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023. For further information, refer to the audited financial statements and footnotes thereto in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022.
In October 2021,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract
assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the
acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU should be applied
prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If adopted early, the amendments are applied
retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurred during the fiscal year of adoption. This ASU is
currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In November 2021,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2021-10,  Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosure by Business
Entities about Government Assistance  (ASU 2021-10), which requires the disclosure of government assistance received by most
business entities relating to: (1) the types of government assistance received; (2) the accounting for such assistance; and
(3) the effect of the assistance on a business entity’s financial statements. The additional annual disclosures required are
not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2022, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03,  Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual
Sale Restrictions  (ASU 2022-03), which clarifies and amends the guidance of measuring the fair value of equity securities subject
to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of the equity securities. The adoption of this new standard is not expected to have
a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In December 2022,
the Company purchased the website, intellectual property, source code and domain names of 1ON1.FANS and ONEONONE.FANS (the “Assets”).
Pursuant to the guidance of Topic 805, it was determined that the purchase of the Assets did not meet the definition of a business and
the asset purchase was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The fair value of the consideration, consisting of 300,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock, valued at $435,000, was attributed to a single asset consisting of a website and intellectual property.
Management does not
believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards could have a material effect on the accompanying
financial statements. As new accounting pronouncements are issued, we will adopt those that are applicable under the circumstances.

Note 3 –
Revenue
Recognition
Revenue Recognition under ASC 606
The Company recognizes
service revenue from its consulting contracts, funding portal and game website using the five-step model as prescribed by ASC 606:
●
Identification of the contract,
or contracts, with a customer.
●
Identification of the performance obligations in the
contract.
●
Determination of the transaction price.
●
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract; and
●
Recognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies
a performance obligation.
The Company identifies
performance obligations in contracts with customers, which primarily are professional services, listing fees on our funding portal, and
a portal fee of 4.9% of the money raised on the funding portal. The transaction price is determined based on the amount the Company expects
to be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring the promised services to the customer. The transaction price in the contract is
allocated to each distinct performance obligation in an amount that represents the relative amount of consideration expected to be received
in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied. The Company
usually bills its customers before it provides any services and begins performing services after the first payment is received. Contracts
are typically one year or less. For larger contracts, in addition to the initial payment, the Company may allow for progress payments
throughout the term of the contract.
10
Judgments and
Estimates
The estimation of
variable consideration for each performance obligation requires the Company to make subjective judgments. The Company enters into contracts
with customers that regularly include promises to transfer multiple services, such as digital marketing, web-based videos, offering statements,
and professional services. For arrangements with multiple services, the Company evaluates whether the individual services qualify as
distinct performance obligations. In its assessment of whether a service is a distinct performance obligation, the Company determines
whether the customer can benefit from the service on its own or with other readily available resources, and whether the service is separately
identifiable from other services in the contract. This evaluation requires the Company to assess the nature of each individual service
offering and how the services are provided in the context of the contract, including whether the services are significantly integrated,
highly interrelated, or significantly modify each other, which may require judgment based on the facts and circumstances of the contract.
When agreements involve
multiple distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates arrangement consideration to all performance obligations at the inception
of an arrangement based on the relative standalone selling prices (SSP) of each performance obligation. Where the Company has standalone
sales data for its performance obligations which are indicative of the price at which the Company sells a promised service separately
to a customer, such data is used to establish SSP. In instances where standalone sales data is not available for a particular performance
obligation, the Company estimates SSP by the use of observable market and cost-based inputs. The Company continues to review the factors
used to establish list price and will adjust standalone selling price methodologies as necessary on a prospective basis.
Service Revenue
Service revenue from
subscriptions to the Company’s game website is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contractual subscription term beginning
on the date that the platform is made available to the customer. Payments received in advance of subscription services being rendered
are recorded as a deferred revenue. Professional services revenue is recognized over time as the services are rendered.
When a contract with
a customer is signed, the Company assesses whether collection of the fees under the arrangement is probable. The Company estimates the
amount to reserve for uncollectible amounts based on the aging of the contract balance, current and historical customer trends, and communications
with its customers. These reserves are recorded as operating expenses against the contract assets.
Contract Assets
Contract assets are
recorded for those parts of the contract consideration not yet invoiced but for which the performance obligations are completed. The
revenue is recognized when the customer receives services. Contract assets are included in other current assets in the consolidated balance
sheets and will be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period.
Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenues
represent billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition and are recognized upon transfer of control. Balances consist
primarily of annual plan subscription services and professional services not yet provided as of the balance sheet date. Deferred revenues
that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period are recorded as current deferred revenues in the consolidated balance
sheets, with the remainder recorded as other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
11
Costs to Obtain
a Customer Contract
Sales commissions
and related expenses are considered incremental and recoverable costs of acquiring customer contracts. These costs are capitalized as
other current or non-current assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, which approximates the benefit
period. The benefit period was estimated by taking into consideration the length of customer contracts, technology lifecycle, and other
factors. All sales commissions are recorded as consulting fees within the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.
Remaining Performance
Obligations
The Company’s
subscription terms are typically less than one year. All of the Company’s revenues in the three and nine months ended January 31,
2023, which amounted to $ 2,260,414
and $ 5,379,960 , respectively, are considered contract revenues. Contract revenue as of January 31,
2023 and April 30, 2022, which has not yet been recognized, amounted to $ 718
and $ 2,532 , respectively, and is recorded on the balance
sheet as deferred revenue. The Company expects to recognize revenue on all of its remaining performance obligations over the next 12
months.

As of January 31,
2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company owed its principal lender (“Lender”) $350,000 and $1,400,000, respectively, under an
amended loan and security agreement (“Loan”) dated July 26, 2014 and amended several times thereafter so that the maturity
date is now April 30, 2023.
In connection with
the financing, the Company has agreed to certain restrictive covenants, including, among others, that the Company may not convey, sell,
lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any part of its business or property, except as permitted in the agreement, dissolve, liquidate
or merge with any other party unless, in the case of a merger, the Company is the surviving entity, incur any indebtedness except as
defined in the agreement, create or allow a lien on any of its assets or collateral that has been pledged to the Lender, make any loans
to any person, except for prepaid items or deposits incurred in the ordinary course of business, or make any material capital expenditures.
To secure the payment of all obligations to the Lender, the Company granted the Lender a continuing security interest and first lien
on all of the assets of the Company.
As of January 31,
2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company’s related-party unsecured notes payable totaled $15,000 and $22,860, respectively.
As of January 31,
2023 and April 30, 2022, the company owed $0 and $300,000 in convertible notes payable. On July 14, 2022, the Company issued 93,432 shares
of common stock valued at $266,272 to retire the $300,000 in convertible promissory notes plus accrued interest of $10,192.
The Company owes
$34,324 as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022 to Chase Bank. The Company pays interest expense to Chase Bank, which is calculated
at a rate of 7.50%   per annum.
On May 6, 2020, the
Company borrowed $1,885,800 (the “May Loan”), on June 17, 2020 the Company borrowed $500,000 (the “June Loan”),
and on February 2, 2021, the Company borrowed $1,885,800 (the “February Loan”) from a U.S. Small Business Administration
(“SBA”) loan program.
The May loan bore interest at a rate of
1% per annum and was forgiven in its entirety, including accrued interest of $18,502. As a result, the Company recognized debt forgiveness
of $1,904,296 in the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022.
The June Loan required
installment payments of $2,594 monthly, beginning on June 17, 2021, over a term of thirty years. However, the SBA postponed the first
installment payment for 18 months, and the first payment became due on December 17, 2022. The monthly payments of $2,594 are first applied
to accrued interest payable. The monthly payments will not be applied to any of the outstanding principal balance until August of 2026.
Consequently, the entire loan balance of $500,000 is classified as a long term liability. Interest accrues at a rate of 3.75% per annum.
The Company agreed
to grant a continuing security interest in its assets to secure payment and performance of all debts, liabilities, and obligations to
the SBA. The June Loan was personally guaranteed by the Company’s Chief Financial Officer.
The February loan
bears interest at a rate of 1% per annum and the due date of the first payment has been postponed by the SBA because the Company has
applied for forgiveness of the February Loan.

As a result
of the two offerings, the company has warrants outstanding, with a five-year term, to purchase a total of 1,469,982 shares of its common
stock at an exercise price of $5.19 and 71,700 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $1.75. The warrants issued to the underwriter’s
representatives and to the underwriter were not part of a unit, consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant and are valued
based upon unadjusted quoted prices on the Nasdaq market. The value of the 60,250 representatives’ warrants amounted to $26,510
and the value of the 111,300 underwriter’s warrants amounted to $48,972. The value of the warrants is not an addition to capital
in excess of par value because the value of the warrants is also an offsetting offering cost.
During the quarter
ended October 31, 2022, the Company issued 37,500 shares of common stock, valued at $366,375, in conjunction with the purchase of a 10%
equity stake in Caesar Media Group, Inc. The Company also issued 2,600 shares of common stock in conjunction with a stock subscription
agreement with accredited investors, valued at $23,400.
During the quarter
ended January 31, 2023, in addition to the public offering, the Company issued 18,750 shares of common stock, valued at $171,124, in
conjunction with the purchase of a 10% equity stake in Caesar Media Group, Inc., 300,000 shares of common stock, valued at $435,000 to
purchase the website and intellectual property of a real-time video conferencing website, and 6,250 shares of common stock in conjunction
with an acquisition agreement that requires shares to be issued by the Company. As a result of this issuance, the value of the account
for Shares to be issued decreased by $61,063 to $183,187 as of January 31, 2023, from a balance of $244,250 as of April 30, 2022.
On January 5, 2023,
the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K and announced the formation of the Netcapital Inc. 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan
(the “Plan”). The purposes of the Plan are to (i) provide an additional incentive to selected employees, directors,
and independent contractors of the Company or its affiliates whose contributions are essential to the growth and success of the Company,
(ii) strengthen the commitment of such individuals to the Company and its affiliates, (iii) motivate those individuals to faithfully
and diligently perform their responsibilities and (iv) attract and retain competent and dedicated individuals whose efforts will
result in the long-term growth and profitability of the Company. In conjunction with these purposes, the Company granted stock options
to four individuals to purchase an aggregate of 1,600,000 of our common stock at a price of $1.43 per share. See Note 7. The options
vest monthly on a straight-line basis over a 4-year period and expire in 10 years. As of January 31, 2023 options to purchase 1,600,000
shares of common stock were outstanding under the Plan. The stock options are subject to stockholder approval, and the Company has called
a special meeting of stockholders on March 28, 2023 to approve the adoption of the Plan.
Note 9 –
Fair Value
The Fair Value Measurements
Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
●
Level
1:	inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability
to access at the measurement date.
●
Level
2:	inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly.
●
Level
3: inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Under the Fair Value
Measurements Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, we base fair value on the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It is our policy to maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements, in accordance with
the fair value hierarchy. Fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where there exists limited or no observable market data
and, therefore, are based primarily
upon management’s own estimates, are often calculated based on current pricing policy, the economic and competitive environment,
the characteristics of the asset or liability and other such factors. Therefore, the results cannot be determined with precision and
may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability. Additionally, there may be inherent weaknesses
in any calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used.
Note 10 –
Stock-Based Compensation
Plans

and $ 128,963 , respectively. This expense is
the estimated value of the vesting of 1,852,000 stock options that are outstanding as of January 31, 2023, and vest monthly over a 48-month
period.
For the three and
nine months ended January 31, 2022, stock-based compensation expense amounted to $ 653,975
and $ 1,137,042 , respectively.

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets
with defined useful lives are generally measured at cost less straight-line amortization. The useful life is determined using the period
of the underlying contract or the period of time over which the intangible asset can be expected to be used. Impairments are recognized
if the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of either the fair value
less costs to sell or the value in use. The value in use is determined on the basis of future cash inflows and outflows, and the weighted
average cost of capital. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, such as trade names and trademarks, that have been acquired
as part of acquisitions are measured at cost and tested for impairment annually, or if there is an indication that their value has declined.
In December 2022,
the Company purchased the website, intellectual property, source code and domain names of 1ON1.FANS and ONEONONE.FANS (the “Assets”).
Pursuant to the guidance of Topic 805, it was determined that the purchase of the Assets did not meet the definition of a business and
the asset purchase was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The fair value of the consideration, consisting of 300,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock, valued at $435,000, was attributed to a single asset and is classified as acquired intellectual property
and website.
The following table
sets forth the major categories of the intangible assets as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022

from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned.
Although the Company
believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States,
the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.
Our financial statements
are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). These accounting
principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions
upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions
are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the
financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial statements
would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting
treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application.
There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different
result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in
this report.

A realized loss of
$406,060 was recorded in the nine months ended January 31, 2023, as compared to no realized losses in the nine months ended January 31,
2022. The Company sold 606,060 shares of KingsCrowd Inc. in June 2022 for proceeds of $200,000 that had been valued at 606,060 and recorded
a realized loss on the sale of the investment of $406,060.
Unrealized gains
on equity securities for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 decreased by $1,418,245, or approximately 43%, to $1,857,500, as compared
to $3,275,745 during the nine months ended January 31, 2022. The decrease in unrealized gains is attributable to the sale of common stock
at $1.00 per share in a public offering by Kingscrowd Inc., which exceeded the carrying value on our books by $3,275,745, during the
nine months ended January 31, 2022, as compared to a net gain of $1,857,500 from observable price changes in investment securities of
three investments held by the Company during the nine months ended January 31, 2023.
Liquidity and
Capital Resources
At January 31, 2023,
we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,771,927 and negative working capital of $844,802 as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $473,925
and negative working capital of $3,113,403 at April 30, 2022.
We have been successful
in raising capital by selling restricted common stock and by completing a public offering of our common stock.
26
On
July 15, 2022, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 1,205,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and warrants
to purchase 1,205,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at a combined public offering price of $4.15 per share and warrant.
The gross proceeds from the offering were $5,000,750 prior to deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses.
The warrants have a per share exercise price of $5.19, are exercisable immediately, and expire five years from the date of issuance.
With the use of proceeds, we paid $1 million of debt to our secured lender. On December 16, 2022 we completed an underwritten public
offering of 1,247,000 shares of our common stock, at a price to the public of $1.40 per share. In conjunction with this offering, we
issued the underwriter and its designees warrants to purchase 62,350 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.75. The underwriters
exercised their over-allotment option and on January 5, 2023, we issued an additional 187,000 shares of its common stock at a price of
$1.40 per share. We received net proceeds of $1,621,459 for the issuance of a total of 1,434,000 shares of common stock in both the initial
and over-allotment offering. In conjunction with the exercise of the over-allotment, the Company issued the underwriter and its designees
warrants to purchase 9,350 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $1.75.
Netcapital
Funding Portal Inc. (the “Funding Portal”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, maintained an operating account at Silicon
Valley Bank, Santa Clara, CA (“SVB”) with cash balances of approximately $330,000 at the time SVB was closed on March 10,
2023 and subsequently placed into receivership by the FDIC.  The $330,000 was withdrawn from SVB after March 10, 2023 and deposited
in our accounts with other national U.S. banks. Furthermore, the Company and its affiliates maintained accounts at other U.S. banks with
cash balances of approximately $979,000 as of March 10, 2023.   Accordingly, the Company believes it has no exposure to loss
as a result of SVB’s receivership.
SVB
also served as a qualified third-party escrow agent for investors that use the Funding Portal to make investments in companies that seek
to raise capital under the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act of 1933, by listing their securities for sale on
the Funding Portal’s website. At the time SVB was closed, the cash balances in the escrow account totaled approximately $755,000.
The FDIC has stated that all deposits are guaranteed. Currently, all amounts held in the SVB escrow account are insured and
available for withdrawal.
We believe that
our existing cash investment balances, sources of capital and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our
working capital and expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the
next 12 months, the success of our operations, the global economic outlook, and the pace of sustainable growth in our markets, in each
case, in light of the market volatility and uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, among other factors, could impact our business
and liquidity. Up to this point in time, we believe the pandemic has helped drive people to online investing, as we see regular monthly
increases in users and dollars invested, and an increase in issuers seeking to use online fund-raising services in lieu of face-to-face
meetings.
Year over Year

Net cash used in
operating activities amounted to $3,414,714 and $2,303,458 for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The principal

The principal source of cash from operating activities in the nine months ended January 31, 2022 was net income of $3,004,260, a non-cash

in lieu of cash of $1,187,500.

lender. For the nine months ended January 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $625,799, which consisted of

(b) Management’s
Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(f). A system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
Under the supervision
and with the participation of management, including the PEO and the PFO, the Company’s management has evaluated the effectiveness
of its internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on the criteria established in a report entitled “2013
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission” and the
interpretive guidance issued by the Commission in Release No. 34-55929. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s management has
evaluated and concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2023.
The Company’s
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022 does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s registered public accounting
firm was not required to issue an attestation on its internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to the rules of the SEC. The
Company will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures on an ongoing basis.
(c) Changes in
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no
changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act) during the quarter ended January 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
