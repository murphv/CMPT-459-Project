ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS
Beyond
Air, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Beyond Air” or the “Company”) was incorporated on April 28, 2015
under Delaware law. On June 25, 2019, the Company’s name was changed to Beyond Air, Inc. from AIT Therapeutics, Inc.
The
Company is a commercial stage medical device and biopharmaceutical company developing a platform of nitric oxide (“NO”) generators
and delivery systems (the “LungFit ®
platform”) capable of generating NO from ambient air. The Company’s
first device, LungFit ®
PH (“LungFit ®
PH”) received premarket approval from the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (the “FDA”), for the treatment of term and near-term neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure, commonly
referred to as persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (“PPHN”), in June 2022. The NO generated by the LungFit®
PH system is indicated to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in term and near-term (>34
weeks gestation) neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension
in conjunction with ventilatory support and other appropriate agents. The LungFit ®
platform can generate NO up to 400
parts per million (“ppm”) for delivery to a patient’s lungs directly or via a ventilator. LungFit ®
can
deliver NO either continuously or for a fixed amount of time at various flow rates and has the ability to either titrate dose on demand
or maintain a constant dose. In July 2022, the Company commenced marketing LungFit ®
PH in the United States for PPHN as a medical device.
The
Company believes that LungFit ®
can be used to treat patients on ventilators that require NO, as well as patients with
chronic or acute severe lung infections via delivery through a breathing mask or similar apparatus. Furthermore, the Company
believes that there is a high unmet medical need for patients suffering from certain severe lung infections that the
LungFit ®
platform can potentially address. The Company’s other areas of focus with the LungFit ®
platform beyond
PPHN are viral community-acquired pneumonia (“VCAP”) including COVID-19, bronchiolitis, nontuberculous mycobacteria
(“NTM”) lung infection and those with various severe lung infections with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (“COPD”). The Company’s current product candidates will be subject to premarket reviews and approvals by
the FDA, certification through the conduct of a conformity assessment by a notified body in the European Union (the
“EU”), as well as comparable foreign regulatory authorities’ reviews or approvals in other countries or regions.
On
November 4, 2021, Beyond Air reorganized its oncology business into a new private company called Beyond Cancer, Ltd (“Beyond Cancer”).
Beyond Air’s preclinical oncology team and the exclusive right to the intellectual property portfolio utilizing ultra-high concentration
of gaseous nitric oxide (“UNO”) for the treatment of solid tumors now reside with Beyond Cancer. The new subsidiary secured
$ 30
million in private placement of common shares, including $ 4.8
million in conjunction with the retirement of long-term debt, providing
investors with
20 % equity ownership in Beyond Cancer. Beyond Air retained
80 % ownership in Beyond Cancer (see Note 12).

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Basis
of Presentation
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to the Form 10-Q. Accordingly,
they do not include all the information and footnotes required to be presented for complete financial statements. The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) which are, in the opinion
of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The accompanying consolidated balance
sheet as of March 31, 2022 (the “2022 Annual Report”) was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
on June 29, 2022. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures should be read in conjunction with
the Company’s financial statements and the related notes thereto included in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Principles
of Consolidation
These
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the accounts of all the Company’s subsidiaries and a
variable interest entity (“VIE”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. As the Company has both the power to direct
activities of Beyond Cancer that most significantly impact Beyond Cancer’s economic performance and the right to receive benefits
and losses that may potentially be significant, these financial statements are fully consolidated with those of the Company. The non-controlling
owners’
20 % interest in Beyond Cancer’s net assets and result of operations is reported as “non-controlling interest”
on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and as “net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest” in
the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). All intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in the accompanying financial statements.
Reclassifications
Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the
reported results of operations.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing
basis, the Company evaluates its significant estimates including accruals for expenses under consulting, licensing agreements, and clinical
trials, stock-based compensation, contingency recognition and the determination of deferred tax attributes and the valuation allowance
thereon.
Liquidity
Risks and Uncertainties
The
Company used cash in operating activities of $ 24.6
million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, and has accumulated losses attributable
to the stockholders of Beyond Air of $ 159.3
million. The Company had cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and certain restricted
cash of $ 55.7
million as of December 31, 2022 ($ 33.3
million excluding Beyond Cancer (see Note 2)). Based on management’s current
business plan and taking into consideration cash designated for the Beyond Cancer program, the Company estimates that its cash and liquidity
is sufficient to finance its operating requirements for at least one year from the date of filing these consolidated financial statements.
The
Company’s future capital needs and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many factors, including, but not necessarily
limited to, the success and costs of commercialization of the Company’s approved product and the actual cost and time necessary
for current and anticipated preclinical studies, clinical trials and other actions needed to obtain certification or regulatory approval
of the Company’s product candidates.
The
Company’s access to capital and liquidity currently includes a $ 40
million stock purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund,
LLC (“LPC”) (the “New Stock Purchase Agreement”), of which approximately $ 18.1
million remains available as
of December 31, 2022. The New Stock Purchase Agreement provides for issuances through May 2023 at the Company’s discretion as long
as certain requirements are met (see Note 5).
The
Company entered into an At-The-Market Offering Sales Agreement, dated February 4, 2022 (the “2022 ATM”) for $ 50
million,
of which $ 49.8
million in funds are available under this agreement as of December 31, 2022 (see Note 5).
The
Company may be required to raise additional funds through equity or debt securities offerings or strategic collaboration and/or licensing
agreements in order to fund operations if it is unable to generate enough product or royalty revenues, if any. Such financing may not
be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and the Company’s failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse
effect on its strategic objectives, results of operations and financial condition.
Other
Risks and Uncertainties
The
Company is subject to risks common to development and early-stage medical device companies including, but not limited to, new technological
innovations, certifications or regulatory approval, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with
government regulations, product liability, uncertainty of market acceptance of approved products and the potential need to obtain additional
financing. The Company is also dependent on third-party suppliers and, in some cases single-source suppliers.
The
Company’s products require approval or clearance from the FDA prior to commencement of commercial sales in the United States. There
can be no assurance that the Company’s products beyond LungFit ®
PH in the U.S. will receive the required approvals
or clearances. Certifications, approvals or clearances are also required in foreign jurisdictions in which the Company may license or
sell its products. If the Company is denied such certifications or approvals or clearances or such certifications, approvals or clearances
are delayed, such denial or delay may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position
and liquidity. Further, there can be no assurance that the Company’s product will be accepted in the marketplace, nor can there
be any assurance that any future products can be developed or manufactured at an acceptable cost and with appropriate performance characteristics,
or that such products will be successfully marketed, if at all.

NOTE
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES (continued)
The
development of the Company’s product candidates or commercialization of its approved product could be further disrupted and adversely
affected by a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company experienced significant delays in the supply chain for LungFit ®
due to the redundancy in parts and suppliers with ventilator manufacturing which has since been remedied. Residual effects from
the COVID-19 pandemic on the global supply chain having an effect on our ability to manufacture have been addressed, but the stability
of the situation is unclear. The Company continuously assesses the impact COVID-19 may have on the Company’s business plans and
its ability to conduct the preclinical studies and clinical trials as well as on the Company’s reliance on third-party manufacturing
and global supply chains. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to avoid part or all of any impact from COVID-19
or its consequences if a resurgence occurs.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments and Restricted Cash
The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and an investment
in a U.S. government money market fund to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
in highly rated financial institutions in Israel, Ireland and the U.S., the balances of which, at times, may exceed federally insured
limits.
Marketable
securities include investment in fixed income bonds and U.S. Treasury securities that are considered to be highly liquid and easily tradeable.
The marketable securities are considered trading securities and are measured at fair value and are accounted for in accordance with ASC
320. The marketable securities are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities and are therefore classified
as Level 1 within the Company’s fair value hierarchy.
As
of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, restricted cash was $ 10.1
million and $ 10.0
million, respectively. In both reporting periods,
$ 2.6
million was designated for a contract manufacturer to be used for materials and parts that require long lead times and $ 7.4
million
was held as collateral to secure a supersedeas bond for an appeal of a lawsuit (see Note 11).

Revenue
Recognition
The
Company recognizes revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with
customers, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance
obligation(s) in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s)
in the contract and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation(s). At contract inception, the
Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract, assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct and
identifies those promised goods or services that are performance obligations.
The
Company will be required to use judgment to determine (a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under
step (ii) above and whether those performance obligations are distinct from other performance obligations in the contract (b) the
transaction price under step (iii) above and (c) the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the
contract for the allocation of the transaction price in step (iv) above. The Company will also be required to use judgment to determine whether
milestones or other variable consideration, except for royalties, should be included in the transaction price. The transaction price
is allocated to each performance obligation on an estimated stand-alone selling price basis, for which the Company recognizes
revenue as or when the performance obligations under contract are satisfied. Where a portion of non-refundable up-front fees or
other payments received are allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of a license arrangement, such fees or
other payments are recorded as contract liabilities and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is
satisfied.
Grant
Receivable
Under
a collaboration arrangement with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (“CFF”), grant milestones are achieved subject to certain
performance steps and requirements under a development program. Grant milestones are recorded as reimbursements against the applicable
portion of the Company’s research and development expenses. Such reimbursements are reflected as a reduction of research and development
expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), as the performance of research
and development services for reimbursement is not considered to be an ongoing component or central to the Company’s operations.
See Note 10.
Segment
Reporting
Commencing
with the creation of Beyond Cancer in November 2021 (see Note 12), the Company’s operations became classified into two segments,
Beyond Air and Beyond Cancer. Each segment has its own management team, board of directors, corporate officers and legal entities. As
of December 31, 2022, Beyond Air, Inc. owns
80 % of the common stock of Beyond Cancer. The segment reporting is based on the manner in
which the Company’s CEO as chief operating decision maker assesses performance and allocates resources across the organization.
The Beyond Air segment includes unallocated corporate expenses associated with the public company fees as well as all corporate related
assets and liabilities.

Research
and development expenses are charged to the statement of operations as incurred. Research and development expenses include salaries,
benefits, stock-based compensation and costs incurred by outside laboratories, manufacturers, clinical research organizations,
consultants, and accredited facilities in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials. Research and development expenses
are partially offset by the benefit of tax incentive payments for qualified research and development expenditures from the
Australian tax authority (“AU Tax Rebates”). The Company does not record AU Tax Rebates until payment is received due to
the uncertainty of receipt. In the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company received an AU Tax Rebate
in the amount of $ 182
thousand
and $ 0 ,
respectively. The entirety of the $ 182

Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company measures the cost of employee and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the
grant date fair value of the award. Fair value for restricted stock unit awards is valued using the closing price of the Company’s
common stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value is recognized over the requisite service period during which an employee
and non-employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, using the accelerated method. The grant date fair value of
employee and non-employee share options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The risk-free interest rate assumptions
were based upon the observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the equity instruments. The expected dividend yield
was assumed to be zero as the Company has not paid any dividends since its inception and does not anticipate paying dividends in the
foreseeable future. Due to the Company’s limited trading history, the Company utilizes weighting of its historical volatility and
the implied volatility based on an aggregate of guideline companies. The Company uses the simplified method to estimate the expected
term.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows:
SCHEDULE
OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT USEFUL LIFE OF ASSETS
Computer

Licensed
Right to Use Technology
Licensed
right to use technology that is considered platform technology with alternative future uses is recorded as an intangible asset and is
amortized on a straight-line method over its estimated useful life, determined to be thirteen years (see Note 11).
Supplier
Concentration
The
Company relies on third-party suppliers to provide materials for its devices and consumables. In the nine months ended December
31, 2022, the Company purchased approximately
78 % if its materials from two third-party vendors, with these vendors representing
65 %
and
13 %, respectively. In the nine months ended December 31, 2021, the Company had
no
significant supplier concentration.
Long-Lived
Assets
The
Company assess the impairment of long-lived assets on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that the Company considers as potential triggers of an impairment review include the
following:
●
significant
underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results,
●
significant
changes in the manner of the Company’s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for its overall business,
●
significant
negative regulatory or economic trends, and
●
significant
technological changes, which would render the platform technology, equipment, and manufacturing processes obsolete.

Recoverability
of assets that will continue to be used in the Company’s operations is measured by comparing the carrying value to the future net
undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Future undiscounted cash flows include estimates of future
revenues, driven by market growth rates, and estimates of future costs. There were no events during the reporting periods that were deemed
to be a triggering event that would require an impairment assessment.
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognized in income or expense in the period that the change is effective. Tax benefits are
recognized when it is probable that the deduction will be sustained. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than
not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will either expire before the Company is able to realize the benefit, or that future
deductibility is uncertain. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a valuation allowance to the full extent
of the Company’s net deferred tax assets since the likelihood of realization of the benefit does not meet the more-likely-than-not
threshold.
The
Company’s reserves related to taxes are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company
in its tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related
to the tax benefit. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits or related interest and penalties accrued.
The Company has not, as yet, conducted a study of research and development (“R&D”) credit carryforwards. This study may
result in an adjustment to the Company’s R&D credit carryforwards; however, until a study is completed and any adjustment is
known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position. The Company’s uncertain tax positions are related to years
that remain subject to examination by relevant tax authorities. Since the Company is in a loss carryforward position, the Company is
generally subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state and local income tax authorities for all tax years in which a loss carryforward
is available.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
The
Company’s financial instruments primarily include cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable, and a short-term loan.
Due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments, the carrying amounts of these assets and liabilities approximate their fair
value. The long-term debt approximates fair value due to the prevailing market conditions for similar debt with remaining maturity and
terms.
Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the
inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value. A fair value hierarchy has been established for valuation inputs
that give the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
Level
1 -
quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level
2 -
inputs
other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets
or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that
are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or
Level
3 -
unobservable
inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Contingencies
On
March 16, 2018, Empery Asset Master, Ltd., Empery Tax Efficient, LP and Empery Tax Efficient II, LP, (collectively, “Empery”)
filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (the “Trial Court”) against the Company relating to the notice
of adjustment of both the exercise price of and the number of warrant shares issuable under warrants issued to Empery in January 2017.
Empery alleges that, as a result of certain circumstances in connection with a February 2018 financing transaction, the
166,672
warrants
issued to Empery in January 2017 provide for adjustments to both the exercise price of the warrants and the number of warrant shares
issuable upon such exercise.
On
August 20, 2020, the Trial Court denied the Company’s summary judgment motion as to the first and third claims for relief, but
dismissed the second claim for declaratory judgment as moot (the “August 20 Decision”). The Appellate Division First
Department denied the Company’s appeal of the August 20 Decision on September 30, 2021. Following a three-day bench trial, the
Trial Court issued a decision on October 14, 2021, finding in favor of Empery on the two remaining claims, granting reformation of
the Warrant Agreement, and awarding Empery damages in the aggregate amount of approximately $ 5.8
million. On November 12, 2021, the Company filed a notice of appeal. Pending appeal, the Company is required to use approximately
$ 7.4
million of
cash as collateral to secure a supersedeas bond for the full amount of damages and interest in case the Company is unsuccessful in
its appeal. Management has determined that a loss related to this matter could range from $ 0
to $ 7.4
million. On September 30, 2021,
the Company recorded an estimate for a contingent loss of $ 2.4
million, and has recorded a total of $ 2.6
million including accrued interest as of December 31, 2022 which represents Management’s best estimate of the potential loss. In
consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company believes that it has several meritorious defenses against the claims, and the
decision of the Trial Court including, but not limited to, the quantification of damages. The Company perfected its appeal in
September 2022. Oral argument was held in the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division First Department, on February 7, 2023
and a decision is pending.
On
December 28, 2021 Hudson Bay Master Fund (“Hudson”) filed a lawsuit against us related to the notice of adjustment of the
exercise price of and the number of warrant shares issuable under warrants issued to Hudson in January 2017. Hudson received
83,334
warrants
in connection with the January 2017 offering.
Hudson’s
complaint alleges breach of contract and that Hudson is entitled to damages estimated at approximately $ 2.6
million
as a result of certain adjustments to the exercise price and number of warrant shares issuable following the February 2018 financing
transaction. Management has determined that a loss related to this matter could range from $ 0
to $ 2.6
million. On November 18, 2022,
Hudson Bay filed a motion for partial summary judgment arguing that fundamental principles of collateral estoppel prevent the
Company from litigating certain findings of fact made by the Trial Court in the Empery case. On January 10, 2023, the Court issued a
decision granting partial summary judgment pertaining to collateral estoppel that Beyond Air may not relitigate certain findings of
fact, including the price adjustment on the warrant and methodology of calculating damages. On December 31, 2022, the Company
recorded an estimate for a contingent loss of $ 0.2
million
associated with the price adjustment. Discovery is ongoing and presently scheduled to be completed in March 2023.
The Company believes, in consultation with outside counsel, that it has
meritorious defenses to the claims and intends to filed a Notice of Appeal in connection with the Order granting partial summary judgment

Introduction
We
are a commercial-stage medical device and biopharmaceutical company developing a platform of nitric oxide (“NO”) generators
and delivery systems (the “LungFit ®
platform”) capable of generating NO from ambient air. Our first device,
LungFit ® PH, received premarket approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), for persistent
pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (“PPHN”), in June 2022. The NO generated by the LungFit ®   PH system
is indicated to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in term and near-term (>34 weeks gestation)
neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension in conjunction
with ventilatory support and other appropriate agents. The LungFit ®
platform can generate NO up to 400 parts per million
(“ppm”) for delivery to a patient’s lungs directly or via a ventilator. LungFit ®
can deliver NO either
continuously or for a fixed amount of time at various flow rates and has the ability to either titrate dose on demand or maintain a constant
dose. LungFit ®
can be used to treat patients on ventilators that require NO, as well as patients with chronic or acute
severe lung infections via delivery through a breathing mask or similar apparatus. Furthermore, we believe that there is a high unmet
medical need for patients suffering from certain severe lung infections that the LungFit ®
platform can potentially address.
Our current areas of focus with LungFit ®
are PPHN, viral community-acquired pneumonia (“VCAP”) including COVID-19
(previously acute viral pneumonia), bronchiolitis, nontuberculous mycobacteria (“NTM”) lung infection and those with various
severe lung infections with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”). The Company’s current product
candidates will be subject to premarket reviews and approvals by the FDA, certification through the conduct of a conformity assessment
by a notified body in the EU for the product to be CE marked, as well as comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The Company’s
system will be marketed as a medical device in the U.S.
An
additional program of Beyond Air targets solid tumors, through our majority-owned affiliate Beyond Cancer, Ltd. (“Beyond Cancer”).
The LungFit ®
platform is not utilized for the solid tumor indication due to need for ultra-high concentrations of gaseous
nitric oxide (“UNO”). A proprietary delivery system has been developed that can safely deliver UNO in excess of 10,000 ppm
directly to a solid tumor. This program has advanced to phase 1 and the first patient was treated in August 2022. Top line results
in the first human trial are expected in calendar year 2023.
23
LungFit ®
PH is the first FDA approved system using our patented ionizer technology to generate on-demand nitric oxide from ambient air and,
regardless of dose or flow, deliver it to a ventilator circuit. The device uses a medical air compressor to drive room air through a
plasma chamber in the center of the unit where pulses of electrical discharge are created between two electrodes. The system uses the
power equivalent to a 60-watt lightbulb to ionize the nitrogen and oxygen molecules, which then combine as NO with low levels of nitrogen
dioxide (“NO 2 ”) created as a byproduct. The products are then passed through a Smart Filter, which removes the toxic NO 2
from the internal circuit. With respect to PPHN, the novel LungFit ®
PH is designed to deliver a dosage of NO to the lungs
that is consistent with current guidelines for delivery of 20 ppm NO with a range of 0.5 ppm – 80 ppm (low concentration NO) for
ventilated patients.
We
believe the ability of LungFit ®
PH to generate NO from ambient air provides us with many competitive advantages over the
current standard of NO delivery systems in the U.S., the EU, Japan and other markets. For example, LungFit ®
PH does not
require the use of a high-pressure cylinder, does not require cumbersome purging procedures and places less burden on hospital staff
in carrying out safety procedures.
Our
novel LungFit ®
platform can also deliver a high concentration ( > 150 ppm) of NO directly to the lungs, which
we believe has the potential to eliminate microbial infections including bacteria, fungi and viruses, among others. We believe that current
FDA-approved NO vasodilation treatments would have limited success in treating microbial infections given the low concentrations of NO
being delivered (<100 ppm). Given that NO is produced naturally by the body as an innate immunity mechanism, at a concentration of
200 ppm, supplemental high dose NO should aid in the body’s fight against infection. Based on our preclinical and clinical studies,
we believe that 150 ppm is the minimum therapeutic dose to achieve the desired pulmonary antimicrobial effect of NO. To date, neither
the FDA nor comparable foreign regulatory agencies in other countries or regions have approved any NO formulation and/or delivery system
for >80 ppm NO.
LungFit ®
PH for the treatment of Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN)
In
June 2022, the FDA approved LungFit ®
PH to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
in term and near-term (>34 weeks gestation) neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic
evidence of pulmonary hypertension in conjunction with ventilatory support and other appropriate agents. LungFit ®
PH
is the inaugural device from the LungFit ®
platform of NO generators that use patented ionizer technology and is the first
FDA-approved product for Beyond Air.
We
also expect to receive the CE Mark under the Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) in the EU during the first half of fiscal
year 2024. According to the most recent year-end report from Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, sales of NO were $448.5 million in 2021 (down
from $574.1 million in 2020) for the United States, Canada, Japan, Mexico and Australia, with ~90% in the United States. Outside of the
U.S. there are multiple market participants which translates to considerably lower sales than in the U.S. We believe the U.S. sales potential
of LungFit ®
PH in PPHN to be greater than $400 million and worldwide sales potential to be greater than $700 million.
We initiated the first phase of our commercial launch in July 2022 in the U.S. and will continue to work toward a potential launch in
the EU and globally in 2023 and beyond.
LungFit ®
PRO for the treatment of viral lung infections in hospitalized patients
Viral
Community-Acquired Pneumonia (including COVID-19)
Viral
pneumonia in adults is most commonly caused by rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (“RSV”) and influenza virus. However,
newly emerging viruses (including SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, avian influenza A, and H1N1 viruses) have been identified as pathogens contributing
to the overall burden of adult viral pneumonia. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, that has resulted in a global
pandemic, causing millions of hospitalizations and over 6.6 million deaths worldwide as of January 2023 according to the World Health
Organization. Excluding the pandemic, there are approximately 350,000 annual viral pneumonia hospitalizations in the US, and up to 16
million annual viral pneumonia hospitalizations globally. For the broader annual viral pneumonia hospitalizations, we believe U.S. market
potential to be greater than $1.5 billion and worldwide market potential to be greater than $3 billion.
We
initiated a pilot study in late 2020 using our novel LungFit ®
PRO system at 150 ppm to treat patients with VCAP. The trial
was a multi-center, open-label, randomized clinical trial in Israel, including patients infected with COVID-19. Patients were randomized
in a 1:1 ratio to receive either inhalations of 150 ppm NO given intermittently for 40 minutes four times per day for up to seven days
in addition to standard supportive treatment (“NO+SST”) or standard supportive treatment alone (“SST”). Endpoints
related to safety (primary endpoint), oxygen saturation and intensive care unit admission, among others, were assessed.
24
In
April 2022 we presented detailed study results at the 32 nd
European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases
(ECCMID 2022), which took place from April 23, 2022 through April 26, 2022 as a hybrid event both onsite in Lisbon, Portugal and online.
At the time of the data cut off, the trial enrolled a total of 40 subject hospitalized for VCAP (SARS-CoV-2, n=39; other viruses n=1).
The ITT population included 35 subjects with 16 subjects in the inhaled NO group and 19 subjects in the control group. The primary COVID-19
treatments used during the study were Remdesivir (>30%) and Dexamethasone (>65%). Safety data from the study show that inhaled
NO treatment was well tolerated overall with no treatment related adverse events as assessed by the investigators. There were two serious
adverse events reported in the group receiving inhaled NO along with SST, which were determined to be related to underlying conditions
and unrelated to study drug/device. From an efficacy perspective, results show a trend of shortening length of stay (“LOS”)
in favor of the inhaled NO treatment group by a factor 1.8 in favor of inhaled NO treatment. Duration of oxygen support, measured in-hospital
and at home, was significantly shorter (p=0.0339) for inhaled NO treated subjects. Subjects with unstable oxygen saturation during hospitalization,
66.7% of the inhaled NO treatment group reached stable saturation of ≥93% during hospital stay as compared to 26.7% in the SST group.
After
completion of the study and the 180-follow-up period, incremental data were provided in a poster presentation at IDWeek 2022 held from
October 19, 2022 through October 23, 2022 in Washington DC. The efficacy results show a trend of shortening LOS in favor of the inhaled
NO treatment group. Also, duration of oxygen support, measured in-hospital and at home, was significantly shorter for inhaled NO treated
subjects. Additionally, data show a larger decline in c-reactive protein (CRP) from baseline for subjects treated with NO + SST compared
to the control group. Analysis of the data provides compelling evidence that high concentration NO delivery with the LungFit PRO generator
and delivery system can be a powerful tool against any type of pneumonia, especially COVID-19. The Company anticipates commencing a pivotal
study in calendar year 2023 following discussions with the FDA.
Bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis
is the leading cause of hospital admission in children less than 1 year of age. The incidence is estimated to be 150 million new cases
a year worldwide, with 2-3% (over 3 million) of them severe enough to require hospitalization. Worldwide, 95% 3
of all cases
occur in developing countries. In the U.S., there are approximately 120,000 annual bronchiolitis hospitalizations and approximately 3.2
million annual child hospitalizations globally. Currently, there is no approved treatment for bronchiolitis. The treatment for acute
viral lung infections that cause bronchiolitis in infants is largely supportive care and is based primarily on prolonged hospitalization
during which the infant receives a constant flow of oxygen to treat hypoxemia, a reduced concentration of oxygen in the blood. In addition,
systemic steroids and inhalation with bronchodilators are sometimes utilized until recovery, but we believe that these treatments do
not successfully reduce hospital LOS. We believe the U.S. market potential for bronchiolitis to be greater than $500 million and worldwide
market potential to be greater than $1.2 billion.
25
Our
Bronchiolitis program is currently on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pivotal study was originally set to be performed
in the winter of 2020/21 but was delayed due to the pandemic. We have completed three successful pilot studies for bronchiolitis. A further
analysis of the three previously reported pilot studies was presented at the ATS International Conference 2021, which was held virtually
from May 14, 2021 through May 19, 2021. Analysis across the studies (n=198 infants, mean age 3.9 months) showed that 150 ppm –
160 ppm NO administered intermittently was generally safe and well tolerated with adverse event rates similar among treatment groups
with no reported treatment-related serious adverse events. The short course of treatments with intermittent high concentration inhaled
NO was effective in shortening hospital LOS and accelerating time to fit for discharge – a composite endpoint of clinical signs
and symptoms to indicate readiness to be evaluated for hospital discharge. This treatment was also effective in accelerating time to
stable oxygen saturation – measured as SpO2 ≥ 92% in room air. Additionally, NO at a dose of 85 ppm NO showed no difference
compared to control for all efficacy endpoints, while 150 ppm NO showed statistical significance when compared to control.
Additionally,
long-term safety data for high concentration inhaled NO in bronchiolitis was presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies Meeting 2022
(PAS 22), which was held in Denver, Colorado from April 21, 2022 through April 25, 2022. A total of 101 infants from the three prior
pilot studies for bronchiolitis (n=198) participated in the long-term follow-up study. Study endpoints for the long-term safety study
included the percentage of subjects re-hospitalized for bronchiolitis related reasons, such as wheezing episodes, pneumonia and asthma
and the percentage of subjects re-hospitalized for any reason. Data from the study show the re-hospitalization rate per 100 Patient
Exposure Years (PEY) due to bronchiolitis related reasons trended favorably for the inhaled NO group. In addition, the long-term subject
re-hospitalization rate for any reason was similar between inhaled NO and control groups. As such, the study concluded that the treatment
of hospitalized infants with acute bronchiolitis by intermittent high dose inhaled NO shows a favorable long-term safety profile.
We
believe that the entirety of data at 150 ppm - 160 ppm NO in both adult and infant patient populations supports further development of
LungFit ®
PRO in a pivotal study for patients hospitalized with VCAP or bronchiolitis.
LungFit ®
GO for the treatment of Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)
NTM
lung infection is a rare and serious pulmonary disease associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with NTM lung disease
may experience a multitude of symptoms such as fever, weight loss, cough, lack of appetite, night sweats, blood in the sputum and fatigue.
Patients with NTM lung disease, specifically
Mycobacterium abscessus
( M. abscessus ) representing 20% - 25% of all NTM and
other forms of NTM that are refractory to antibiotic therapy ,
frequently require lengthy and repeated hospital stays to manage
their condition. There are no treatments specifically indicated for the treatment of
M. abscessus
lung disease in North America,
Europe or Japan.
There
are approximately 50,000 to 90,000 people with NTM infections in the U.S. In Asia, the number of patients suffering from NTM surpasses
what is seen in the U.S. There is one inhaled antibiotic approved for the treatment of refractory
Mycobacterium avium
complex
(“MAC”). Current guideline-based approaches to treat NTM lung disease involve multi-drug regimens of antibiotics that may
cause severe, long lasting side effects, and treatment can be as long as 18 months or more. Median survival for NTM MAC patients is approximately
13 years while median survival for patients with other variations of NTM is typically 4.6 years. The prevalence of human disease attributable
to NTM has increased over the past two decades. In a study conducted between 2007 and 2016, researchers found that the prevalence of
NTM in the U.S. is increasing at approximately 7.5% per year.
M. abscessus
treatment costs are estimated to be more than double
that of MAC. In total, a 2015 publication by co-authors from several U.S. government departments stated that annual cases in 2014 cost
the U.S. healthcare system approximately $1.7 billion. For this indication, we believe U.S. sales potential to be greater than $1 billion
and worldwide sales potential to be greater than $2.5 billion.
26
In December 2020 we began a 12-week,
multi-center, open-label clinical trial in Australia intended to enroll approximately 20 adult patients with chronic refractory NTM lung
disease. We received a grant of up to $2.17 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (“CFF”) to fund this study and advance
the clinical development of inhaled NO to treat NTM pulmonary disease. The trial enrolled both cystic fibrosis (“CF”) and non-CF
patients infected with MAC,
M. abscessus
or any strain of NTM. The study consisted of a run-in period followed by two treatment
phases. The run-in period provides a baseline for the efficacy endpoints. The first treatment phase took place over a two-week period
and began in the hospital setting where patients were titrated from 150 ppm NO up to 250 ppm NO over several days. During this phase patients
received NO for 40 minutes, four times per day while MetHb levels were monitored. Patients were also trained to use LungFit ®
GO and subsequently discharged to complete the remaining portion of the two-week treatment period at their home at the highest tolerated
NO concentration. For the second treatment phase, a 10-week maintenance phase, the administration was twice daily. The study evaluated
safety, quality of life, physical function, and bacterial load among other parameters.
At the American Thoracic Society International Conference 2022 (ATS 2022), which was held in San Francisco from May
13, 2022 through May 18, 2022 we presented positive interim data from the ongoing study. At the time of data cutoff on April 4, 2022,
a total of 15 subjects were enrolled in the pilot study. The mean age of subjects was 62.1 years (range: 22 – 82 years) with the
majority female (80%), a distribution consistent with real-world NTM disease. All 15 subjects were successfully titrated to 250 ppm NO
in the hospital setting, and no patients required dose reductions during the subsequent at-home portion of the study. Patients were followed
up for 12 weeks after the 12-week treatment period was completed.
After completion of the study,
we presented positive results at the CHEST (The American College of Chest Physicians) annual meeting, held from October 16, 2022 through
October 19, 2022, further supporting development of intermittent high dose NO for the treatment of NTM. The study demonstrated that high
does nitric oxide treatment was safe and well-tolerated in both the home and hospital settings. During the 10-week at-home treatment period
of the study, a total of 2,492 inhalations were self-administered with overall high treatment compliance (>90%). There were no serious
adverse events (SAE) related to treatment discontinuations reported over the 12-week treatment or 12-week follow up periods. Key efficacy
endpoints showed strong results with improvement seen in the majority of quality-of-life domains. Respiratory function and physical function
were maintained during treatment and follow-up. Trends in the reduction of microbial load were observed and one subject achieved culture
conversion with three consecutive negative sputum samples. We anticipate commencing a pivotal study in the second half of fiscal year
2025 following discussions with the FDA.
Our
program in COPD is in the preclinical stage and, subject to obtaining additional financing, is expected to enter clinical trials in calendar
year 2024.
Ultra-High
Concentration NO (UNO) in solid tumors through majority-owned affiliate Beyond Cancer, Ltd.
In
the fourth calendar quarter of 2021, Beyond Cancer, our newly formed, majority-owned affiliate, raised $30 million in a private placement
of common shares. The investors purchased a 20% equity ownership in Beyond Cancer, while Beyond Air maintained 80% equity ownership in
Beyond Cancer. The funding is expected to be used to accelerate ongoing preclinical work including the completion of IND-enabling studies,
completion of a Phase 1 study, expansion of preclinical programs for combination studies, hiring of additional Beyond Cancer team members,
and optimization of the delivery system, as well as for general corporate purposes.
Beyond
Cancer will benefit from Beyond Air’s NO expertise, IP portfolio, preclinical oncology team, and regulatory progress, and will
pay Beyond Air a single digit royalty on all future revenues. Beyond Cancer will be led by a seasoned leadership team with experience
in emerging healthcare companies and clinical oncology.
27
UNO
has shown anticancer properties in preclinical trials by eliciting an immune response from the host. We have released this preclinical
data at several medical/scientific conferences showing the promise of delivering NO at concentrations of 20,000 ppm – 200,000 ppm
directly to tumors. Results have shown that local tumor ablation with NO conveyed anti-tumor immunity to the host. In April 2022 we presented
new
in vivo
and
in vitro
preclinical data at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting
2022. The
in vivo
study assessed the mode of action following a single 5-minute gaseous NO (“gNO”) treatment provided
data showing an effect on the primary tumor 14 days post treatment. These data showed that intratumoral injections of concentrations
of gNO at 20,000 and 50,000 ppm led to increased recruitment of T cells, B cells, macrophages and dendrocytes to the primary tumor. An
elevated number of T cells and B cells were also detected in the spleen and blood 21 days following gNO treatment. In addition, at the
same timepoint, a marked reduction in the number of myeloid derived suppressor cells was seen in the spleen. Results from the
in vitro
study showed that exposure of six different cancer cell lines – including human ovarian and pancreatic and mouse lung, melanoma,
colon, and breast– to UNO of gNO ranging from 10,000 ppm to 100,000 ppm for up to 10 minutes resulted in a dose-dependent cytotoxic
response. The higher concentration doses of gNO led to near instant cell death, while the lower concentration doses required a longer
exposure period to elicit cell death. Cell viability was assessed using two assays: XTT and clonogenic assay. After one minute of exposure
to 25,000 ppm gNO, less than 10% viability was observed in all cell lines.
The
second half of calendar year 2022 was a time of significant progress for Beyond Cancer. On August 23, 2022, we announced that the first
patient was treated in a first-in-human Phase 1 study to assess the safety and immune biomarkers of UNO therapy. In November at the annual
meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) we presented promising new
in vivo
combination data that support the
potential of the company’s novel gNO therapy to treat various types of solid tumors in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor
(ICI) therapies, including anti-PD-1. The data presented at SITC demonstrate that UNO in combination with anti-PD-1 treatment leads to
significantly higher tumor regression rates and prolonged survival. Also in 2022, on December 13, we announced the publication of pre-clinical
data in
Cancer Cell International
(CCI), which shows that our proprietary tumor ablation technology utilizing UNO results in a
potent innate and adaptive immune response that prevents metastases and resulted in a statistically significant survival benefit.
Calendar
year 2023 began with the announcement of Beyond Cancer’s entry into a sponsored research agreement with Stanford School of
Medicine and the appointment of Frederick M. Dirbas, MD, Associate Professor of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, Stanford
School of Medicine, and Mark D. Pegram, MD, the Suzy Yuan-Huey Hung Endowed Professor of Medical Oncology at the Stanford School of
Medicine to the Beyond Cancer Scientific Advisory Board (SAB). In addition to the research agreement, Dr. Dirbas will serve as Chair
of the SAB, which provides guidance for ongoing preclinical studies as well as ongoing and planned future clinical trials in the use
of UNO to treat solid tumors. The newly appointed members of the SAB will work to provide input on the clinical development of
Beyond Cancer’s UNO technology particularly as it relates to the U.S. regulatory submission.
The
Company expects to present top line data from the human trial in calendar year 2023.
COVID-19
The
development of our product candidates and the commercialization of our approved product could be further disrupted and adversely affected
by a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced significant delays in the supply chain for the LungFit ®
system
due to the redundancy in parts and suppliers for ventilator manufacturing which has since been remedied. We continuously assess the impact
that COVID-19 may have on our business plans and our ability to conduct the preclinical studies and clinical trials as well as on our
reliance on third-party manufacturing and our supply chain. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid part or
all of any impact from COVID-19 or its consequences if a resurgence occurs.
Critical
Accounting Estimates and Policies
A
critical accounting policy and related estimates are both important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results
of operations and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make
estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Our
unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and all applicable U.S. GAAP accounting standards
effective as of December 31, 2022 have been taken into consideration in preparing the unaudited consolidated financial statements. The
preparation of unaudited consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, expenses and related disclosures. Some of those estimates are subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results
could differ from those estimates. The following accounting policies and estimates have been highlighted as significant because changes
to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our consolidated financial statements:
●
Contingent
loss judgments and estimates,
●
Research
and development expense recognition,
●

Comparison
of Three and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 with the Three and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2021
Revenue
On
June 28, 2022 the FDA approved LungFit ®
PH to treat PPHN. No revenue was recognized for the three months or nine months
ended December 31, 2022 or for the three or nine months ended December 31, 2021.
29
Cost
of Revenue
Cost
of revenue of $0.1 million and $0.2 million was recognized for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to $0 for
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. These costs are primarily related to the establishment of several warehouse
locations to optimize deliveries to future customers across the U.S.
Research
and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $5.0 million as compared to $2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase of $2.5 million was primarily attributed to scaling up of our spending on UNO for $1.3 million (including $0.9 million in
salaries and stock-based compensation and $0.4 million in preclinical studies), $0.8 million spend on pre-clinical work on targeted therapeutic
areas in Beyond Air, $0.2 million in people related costs (including salaries, travel and conferences) and $0.2 million other costs.
Research
and development (“R&D”) expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $12.7 million as compared to $8.1
million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increase of $4.6 million was primarily attributed to the $1.7 million
increase of R&D infrastructure and preclinical work in UNO, a $2.1 million increase in stock-based compensation, a $0.5 million
increase in preclinical work in Beyond Air and $0.3 million in people-related costs (including salaries, conferences and travel)
and $0.2 million of other costs, partially offset by the recognition of a ($0.2) million R&D credit received.
General
and Administrative Expenses
General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $8.9 million and $4.9 million, respectively.
The increase of $4.0 million was attributed primarily to an increase of $3.0 million due to the creation of the Beyond Cancer entity,
notably $2.9 million of stock-based compensation plus an increase of $1.0 million in Beyond Air ($0.8 million increase in salaries and
benefits for commercial and support staff, $0.1 million increase in stock-based compensation, $0.3 million increase in travel spend and
$0.2 million increase in legal fees, partially offset by the timing of marketing and branding of ($0.3) million).
General
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $25.1 million and $12.2 million,
respectively. The increase of $12.9 million was attributed primarily to an increase of $8.2 million due to the creation of
the Beyond Cancer entity
in late Q3 of the prior fiscal year ($1.0
million of salary expense, $6.6 million of stock-based compensation, $0.4 million travel and $0.2
million of office expenses and other) plus an increase of $4.7 million in Beyond Air ($1.7 million increase in salaries and benefits
for commercial and support staff, $2.1 million increase in stock-based compensation, $0.2 million increase in insurance, $0.6 million increase in travel spend, $0.3 million increase in IT and physical infrastructure and $0.1 million
in consulting was partially offset by a reduction in legal fees of ($0.4) million).
30
Other
Income (Loss)
Other Income (Loss) for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was a gain of $0.2 million and a loss of ($0.5) million, respectively. The $0.7 million
reduction of other loss is mainly due gains from investments in marketable securities of $0.4 million and foreign exchange gains of $0.4
million, partially offset by the recording of a contingent liability related to a lawsuit for $0.2 million.
Other Income (Loss) for the nine
months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was a loss of ($0.2) million and a loss of ($3.1) million, respectively. The $2.9
million reduction of other loss is mainly due to the recording of a contingent liability related to a lawsuit in 2021 for $2.4 million,
gains from investments in marketable securities for $0.4 million, and a $0.2 million reduction in interest expense, partially offset by
the recording of a contingent liability related to a lawsuit for $0.2 million.
Net
Loss Attributable to Non-controlling Interests
Net
loss attributed to non-controlling interests for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was $1.1 million, compared to $0.2 million
for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Net loss attributed to non-controlling interests for the nine months ended December 31,
2022, was $2.6 million, compared to $0.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Non-controlling interests represent
20% of the net loss of our Beyond Cancer subsidiary, which was established in November 2021.
Net
Loss Attributed to Common Stockholders
Net
loss attributed to common stockholders of Beyond Air, Inc for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was ($12.8) million or a loss
of ($0.43) per share, basic and diluted. Our net loss attributed to common stockholders of Beyond Air, Inc for the three months ended

For

and amortization and $0.5 million decrease in prepaid expenses (mainly related to prepaid insurance), partially offset by ($2.5)

For the nine months ended December 31, 2021 the net

costs on the retired debt facility.

in high quality, short term, US dollar denominated marketable equities with high liquidity, and $1.9 million for the purchase of

mainly for the purchase of property and equipment.

cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $0.7 million, mainly from the ($0.9) million

Contractual
Obligations
There
have been no material changes to our contractual obligations since March 31, 2022. For a summary of our contractual obligations, see
Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for
the year ended March 31, 2022 (the “2022 Annual Report”), filed with the SEC on June 29, 2022 .

Overview
We
have not generated any revenue from the sale of products, but now that we have obtained regulatory approval for LungFit ®
PH, we expect to begin generating revenue in fiscal year 2023. We had an operating cash outflows of $24.6 million for the nine months
ended December 31, 2022 and we have experienced an accumulated loss of $159.3 million since inception through December 31, 2022. As of
December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities of $53.1 million and $10.1 million restricted cash. We believe
that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2022 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and
capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 month from the financial reporting date.
Our
future capital needs and the adequacy of our available funds beyond one year from the date of filing these unaudited consolidated financial
statements will depend on many factors, including, but not necessarily limited to, the cost and time necessary for the development, clinical
studies and certification or regulatory approval of our other medical devices, indications as well as the commercial success of our approved
product and any product candidates that receive marketing approval by the FDA. We may be required to raise additional funds through the
sale of equity or debt securities or through strategic collaborations and/or licensing agreements in order to fund operations until we
are able to generate enough product or royalty revenues, if any. Financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our
failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our strategic objectives, results of operations and financial
condition.
On
February 4, 2022, we entered into a new At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Truist Securities, Inc. and Oppenheimer &
Co, Inc. (the “2022 ATM”). Under the 2022 ATM, we may sell shares of our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of
up to $50 million, from time to time and at various prices. If shares of our common stock are sold, there is a 3% fee paid to the sales
agent. As of December 31, 2022, there was a balance of $49.8 million available under the 2022 ATM.
On
May 14, 2020, we entered into the New Stock Purchase Agreement with LPC, which replaced the former $20 million purchase agreement with
LPC, dated August 10, 2018. The New Stock Purchase Agreement provides for the issuance of up to $40 million of our common stock, which
we may sell from time to time in our sole discretion, to LPC over a period of 36 months, subject to the conditions and limitations in
the New Stock Purchase Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, there was a balance of approximately $18.1 million available under the New
Stock Purchase Agreement.
Our
ability to continue to operate beyond the fourth calendar quarter of 2023 will be largely dependent upon the successful commercial launch
of LungFit ®
PH, as well as obtaining partners in other parts of the world, and the raising of additional funds to finance
our activities until we are generating cash flow from operations. Further, there are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining
an adequate level of financing for the development and commercialization of our other product candidates.
There
are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our NO delivery system and we are unable to estimate the amounts
of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with the completion of the research and development of our product candidates.
Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
●
the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the medical community and the global economy;
●
the
progress and costs of our preclinical studies, clinical trials and other research and development activities;
●
the
costs of commercializing the LungFit ®
system;
●
the
scope, prioritization and number of our clinical trials and other research and development programs;
●
the
costs and timing of obtaining certification or regulatory approval for our product candidates;
●
the
costs of filing, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
●
the
costs of, and timing for, strengthening our manufacturing agreements for production of sufficient clinical quantities of our product
candidates;
●
the
potential costs of contracting with third parties to provide marketing and distribution services for us or for building such capacities
internally;
●
the
costs of acquiring or undertaking the development and commercialization efforts for additional, future therapeutic applications of
our product candidates;
●
the
magnitude of our general and administrative expenses; and
●
any
cost that we may incur under current and future in-and out-licensing arrangements relating to our product candidates.

ITEM
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We
are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial
position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of foreign currency
exchange rates.
ITEM
4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
(our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an
issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes made to our internal controls over financial reporting that materially
affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.
