We pioneered the linear fiber optic transmission technology that enabled the world’s first delivery of CATV directly on fiber, and today are a leading provider of advanced mixed-signal products serving the aerospace and defense and broadband communications markets. The mixed-signal technology, at the heart of our broadband communications products, is shared with our fiber optic gyros (“FOGs”) and other inertial sensors to provide the aerospace and defense markets with state-of-the-art navigation systems technology. Over the last three years, we have expanded our scale and portfolio of inertial sensor products through the acquisitions of Systron Donner Inertial, Inc. (“SDI”) in June 2019, the Space and Navigation (“S&N”) business of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (“L3H”) in April 2022, and the FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems business (“EMCORE Chicago”) of KVH Industries, Inc. (“KVH”) in August 2022. We have fully vertically-integrated manufacturing capability at our headquarters in Alhambra, CA, and at our facilities in Budd Lake, NJ, Concord, CA, and Tinley Park, IL (the “Tinley Park Facility”). These facilities support our vertically-integrated manufacturing strategy for quartz, FOG, and Ring Laser Gyro products for navigation systems, and for our chip, laser, transmitter, and receiver products for broadband applications. We design and manufacture industry-leading Quartz Mems (“QMEMS”), lithium niobate, and indium phosphide (InP) chip-level technology to deliver state-of-the-art component and system-level products across our end-market applications. Our best-in-class components and systems support a broad array of applications including navigation and inertial sensing, defense optoelectronics, broadband communications, optical sensing, and specialty chips for telecom and data center applications. NOTE 2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim information, and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, they do not include all information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements. In our opinion, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are all normal recurring adjustments, that are necessary to provide a fair presentation of the financial results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for an entire fiscal year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of such date. For a more complete understanding of our business, financial position, operating results, cash flows, risk factors, and other matters, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Use of Estimates The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Such estimates include accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, long-lived assets, product warranty liabilities, legal contingencies, income taxes, asset retirement obligations, and pension obligation, as well as the evaluation associated with the Company's assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern. We develop estimates based on historical experience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the best information available to us. Our reported financial position or results of operations may be materially different under changed conditions or when using different estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to significant accounting policies. In the event that estimates or assumptions prove to differ from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. NOTE 3.     Acquisitions On April 29, 2022, we completed the acquisition of the L3H S&N business for a total purchase price of approximately $ 5.0  million in cash, exclusive of transaction costs and expenses and subject to certain post-closing working capital adjustments, resulting in a final adjusted purchase consideration transferred of $ 4.9  million. Following the closing, S&N results are included in our Aerospace and Defense (“A&D”) reportable segment and in our consolidated financial statements beginning
10 Table of Contents on the acquisition date. Revenue and net income of S&N of $ 5.5
million and $ 1.1
million, respectively, is included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income for the three months ended December 31, 2022. On August 9, 2022, we completed the acquisition of EMCORE Chicago pursuant to which we acquired substantially all of KVH's assets and liabilities primarily related to its FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems business, including property interests in the Tinley Park Facility, for aggregate consideration of approximately $ 55.0  million, exclusive of transaction costs and expenses and subject to certain post-closing working capital adjustments. Following the closing, EMCORE Chicago results are included in our A&D reportable segment and in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. Revenue and net income of EMCORE Chicago of $ 7.8
million and $ 1.4
million, respectively, is included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation The total purchase price for each of the S&N acquisition and the EMCORE Chicago acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Due to the fact that each such acquisition occurred in the most recent 12-month period, the Company's fair value estimates for the purchase price allocations are preliminary. The final determination of fair value for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to further change and will be completed as soon as possible, but no later than one year from the applicable acquisition date. Since the acquisition, the preliminary purchase price allocation for S&N has changed by a $ 2.3  million reduction to contract assets and a $ 0.6  million reduction to asset retirement obligation, resulting in a corresponding increase to intangible assets and goodwill acquired. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Any changes in the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period may result in a material adjustment to goodwill. Goodwill from these acquisitions totaled $ 16.4
million, of which
81.1 % was the result of the EMCORE Chicago acquisition, which expanded EMCORE's competitive position in the Inertial Navigation market. The table below represents the preliminary purchase price allocation to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of S&N based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date based on management’s best estimates and assumptions: (in thousands) Amount Tangible assets acquired: Accounts receivable $ 803   Inventory 370   Contract assets 3,920   Operating lease right-of-use assets 1,529   Property, plant, and equipment 1,996   Net pension benefit assets 1,727   Intangible assets acquired 2,740   Goodwill 3,108   Liabilities assumed: Accounts payable ( 1,226 ) Accrued expenses ( 622 ) Contract liabilities ( 6,024 ) Operating lease liabilities ( 1,565 ) Asset retirement obligation ( 1,895 ) Total purchase consideration $ 4,861   The table below represents the preliminary purchase price allocation to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of EMCORE Chicago based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date based on management’s best estimates and assumptions: 11 Table of Contents (in thousands) Amount Tangible assets acquired: Accounts receivable $ 4,977   Inventory 10,800   Prepaid expenses and other current assets 1,483   Property, plant, and equipment 14,442   Intangible assets acquired 12,770   Goodwill 13,342   Liabilities assumed: Accounts payable ( 1,699 ) Accrued expenses ( 485 ) Contract liabilities ( 637 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 8 ) Total purchase consideration $ 54,985   Included in intangible assets acquired are customer relationships of $ 4.0
million, technology of $ 2.6
million, in-process research and development of $ 6.7
million, and trademarks of $ 2.2
million. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred transaction costs of approximately $ 2.1
million, in connection with the acquisitions, which were expensed as incurred and included in selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses within the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information The following unaudited pro forma financial information presented for the three months ended December 31, 2021 does not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the EMCORE Chicago acquisition been consummated on October 1, 2020, nor of the results which may occur in the future. The pro forma amounts are based upon available information and certain assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable. 12 Table of Contents Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Historical (in thousands, except per share data) EMCORE Corporation (excluding EMCORE Chicago) EMCORE Chicago Pro Forma Adjustments Pro Forma Combined Revenue $ 42,236   $ 7,698   $ —   $ 49,934   Cost of revenue 26,439   5,827   171   (a) 32,437   Gross profit 15,797   1,871   ( 171 ) 17,497   Operating expense: Selling, general, and administrative 7,187   2,684   ( 1,026 ) (a)(b) 8,845   Research and development 4,627   1,443   ( 264 ) (a)(b) 5,806   Severance 1,298   —   —   1,298   (Gain) loss on sale of assets 187   —   —   187   Total operating expense 13,299   4,127   ( 1,290 ) 16,136   Operating (loss) income 2,498   ( 2,256 ) 1,119   1,361   Other (expense) income: 0 Interest expense, net ( 11 ) —   318   (c) 307   Foreign exchange gain 42   —   —   42   Other income —  33   —   33   Total other (expense) income 31   33   318   382   (Loss) income before income tax expense 2,529   ( 2,223 ) 1,437   1,743   Income tax expense ( 115 ) ( 13 ) ( 5 ) (d)(e) ( 133 ) Net (loss) income 2,414   ( 2,236 ) 1,432   1,610   Foreign exchange translation adjustment 20   —   —   20   Comprehensive (loss) income $ 2,434   $ ( 2,236 ) 1,432   $ 1,630   Per share data: Net (loss) income per basic share $ 0.07   $ —   $ 0.04   Weighted-average number of basic shares outstanding 36,950 —   36,950   Net (loss) income per diluted share $ 0.06   $ —   $ 0.04   Weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding 39,031   —   39,031   (a) Reflects the impact to depreciation expense and amortization expense as a result of the change in fair value of property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets acquired.

million during the three months ended December 31, 2022. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company consummated the sale of the real property interests in the Tinley Park Facility to 8400 W
14 Table of Contents 185TH STREET INVESTORS, LLC, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $ 10.3  million and a gain on sale of assets of $ 1.2  million. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold certain equipment and recognized a loss on sale of assets of $ 0.2  million. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, there was a triggering event of negative cash flows and operating losses at the FOG asset group level within the Inertial Navigation product line of the A&D segment that indicated the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. In accordance with ASC 360, with regard to our long-lived assets, we performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis and concluded that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable. Accordingly, we then performed an analysis to estimate the fair value of the other long-lived assets and recognized an impairment charge within operating expenses of $ 3.0
million against the FOG property, plant, and equipment by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group's other long-lived assets exceeded their estimated fair value for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Key assumptions utilized in the determination of fair value include expected future cash flows and working capital requirements. While we believe the expectations and assumptions about the future are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Geographical Concentrations Long-lived assets consist of land, building, property, plant, and equipment. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022,
94.4 % and
95.4 %, respectively, of our long-lived assets were located in the United States. NOTE 8.     Intangible Assets and Goodwill Intangible assets arose from the acquisition of SDI in fiscal year 2019 and the acquisitions of S&N and EMCORE Chicago in fiscal year 2022 and are reported within the A&D segment. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of: (a)
7.0
years for patents, (b)
8.0
years for customer relationships, and (c)
2.0 - 8.0
years for technology. In-process research and development (“IPR&D”) is indefinite-lived until completion of the related development project, at which point amortization of the carrying value of the technology will commence. Trademarks are indefinite-lived. The following table summarizes changes in intangible assets, net: (in thousands) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Balance at beginning of period $ 14,790   $ 167   Changes from acquisition 770 14,740 Amortization ( 326 ) ( 117 ) Balance at end of period $ 15,234   $ 14,790   The weighted average remaining useful lives by definite-lived intangible asset category are as follows: December 31, 2022 (in thousands, except weighted average remaining life) Weighted Average Remaining Life (in years) Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value Technology 3.7 $ 11,001   $ ( 8,424 ) $ 2,577   Customer relationships 3.5 3,990   ( 213 ) 3,777   Definite-lived intangible assets total $ 14,991   $ ( 8,637 ) $ 6,354   As of December 31, 2022 IPR&D and trademarks was approximately $ 6.7  million and $ 2.2  million, respectively.

The following table summarizes changes in goodwill: (in thousands) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Balance at beginning of period $ 17,894   $ 69   Adjustments to preliminary purchase price allocation ( 1,375 ) 17,825 Balance at end of period $ 16,519   $ 17,894   NOTE 9.     Benefit Plans We assumed a defined benefit pension plan (the “Pension Plan”) on April 29, 2022 as a result of the acquisition of S&N. The Pension Plan was frozen to new hires as of March 31, 2007 and employees hired on or after April 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the Pension Plan. On July 1, 2022, the Pension Plan was amended to freeze benefit plan accruals for participants. As a result of the freeze, a curtailment was triggered and a restatement of the benefit obligation and plan assets occurred, although no gain or loss resulted. The annual measurement date for the Pension Plan is September 30. Benefits are based on years of credited service at retirement. Annual contributions to the Pension Plan are not less than the minimum funding standards outlined in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. We maintain the Pension Plan with the goal of ensuring that it is adequately funded to meet its future obligations. We did not make any contributions to the Pension Plan during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and do not anticipate making any contributions for the remainder of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023. The components of net periodic pension cost are as follows: (in thousands) Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Service cost $ 26   Interest cost 93   Expected return on plan assets ( 84 ) Net periodic pension cost $ 35
The service cost component of total pension expense is included as a component of SG&A expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The interest cost and expected return on plan assets components of total pension expense are included as components of other (expense) income on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Net pension asset is included as a component of other non-current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Pension Plan assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, and we manage a liability driven investment strategy intended to maintain fully-funded status. 401(k) Plan We have a savings plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under this savings plan, participating employees may defer a portion of their pretax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit. Our matching contribution in cash for each of the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $ 0.2
million. 16 Table of Contents NOTE 10.     Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities The components of accrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following: (in thousands) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Compensation $ 5,964   $ 4,213   Warranty 1,522   1,504 Commissions 429   228 Consulting 264   241 Legal expenses and other professional fees 242   275 Income and other taxes 108   —   Severance and restructuring accruals 854   423 Litigation settlement 294   341 Other 1,520   899 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 11,197   $ 8,124   Severance and restructuring-related accruals specifically relate to the reductions in force. Expense related to severance and restructuring accruals is included in SG&A expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. In an effort to better align current and future business operations related to CATV product lines, we reduced our workforce and recorded $ 0.5  million and $ 1.4
million in severance expense in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 there was $ 0.9
million and $ 0.4  million accrued severance expense, respectively. We expect all severance to be fully paid by the quarter ending June 30, 2023. NOTE 11.     Credit Agreement Wingspire Credit Agreement On August 9, 2022, EMCORE and EMCORE Space & Navigation Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into that certain Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto and Wingspire Capital LLC (“Wingspire”), as administrative agent for the lenders, as amended pursuant to that First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of October 25, 2022, among EMCORE and EMCORE Space & Navigation Corporation, EMCORE Chicago Inertial Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary (together with the Company and S&N, the “Borrowers”), the lenders party thereto and Wingspire, to add EMCORE Chicago as a Borrower and include certain of its assets in the borrowing base (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for
two
credit facilities: (a) an asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 40.0  million, subject to a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory (subject to certain reserves), and (b) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $ 6.0  million. The proceeds of the loans made under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will mature on August 8, 2025, and bear interest at a rate per annum equal to term SOFR plus a margin of (i)
3.75 % or
5.50 % in the case of revolving loans, depending on the applicable assets corresponding to the borrowing base pursuant to which the applicable loans are made and (ii)
5.50 % in the case of the term loan. In addition, the Borrowers are responsible for Wingspire’s annual collateral monitoring fees as well as the lenders’ fees and expenses, including a closing fee of
1.0 % of the aggregate principal amount of the commitments as of the closing with respect to revolving loans and
1.50 % of the aggregate principal amount of the term loan. The Borrowers may also be required to pay an unused line fee of
0.50 % in respect of the undrawn portion of the revolving commitments, which is generally based on average daily usage of the revolving facility during the immediately preceding month. The Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants that are generally customary for credit facilities of this type. Among others, the Credit Agreement contains various covenants that, subject to agreed upon exceptions, limit the Borrowers’ and their respective subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into swap agreements, make loans, acquisitions and investments, change the nature of their business, acquire or sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other persons or entities, declare or pay dividends or make other restricted payments, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into burdensome agreements, change fiscal year, amend organizational documents, and use proceeds to fund any activities of or business with any person that is the subject of governmental sanctions. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that, for any period commencing upon the occurrence of an event of default or excess availability under the Credit Agreement being less than the greater of $ 5.0  million and
15 % of the revolving commitments until such time as no event of default shall be continuing and excess availability under the Credit
17 Table of Contents Agreement shall be at least the greater of $ 5.0  million and
15 % of the revolving commitments for a period of 60 consecutive days, the Borrowers satisfy a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than
1.10 :1.00. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable grace period, would permit the lenders to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable, and exercise rights and remedies available to the lenders under the Credit Agreement or applicable law or equity. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers entered into a pledge and security agreement pursuant to which the obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured on a senior secured basis (subject to permitted liens) by substantially all assets of the Borrowers and substantially all assets of any future guarantors. As of December 31, 2022, an aggregate principal amount of $ 6.6  million was outstanding pursuant to the revolving credit facility and an aggregate principal amount of $ 5.7  million was outstanding pursuant to the term loan facility. As of September 30, 2022, an aggregate principal amount of $ 9.6
million was outstanding pursuant to the revolving credit facility and an aggregate principal amount of $ 5.9
million was outstanding pursuant to the term loan facility. Also, as of December 31, 2022, the revolving credit facility had approximately $ 15.0  million available for borrowing. Provided that no event of default has occurred, and subject to availability limitation, loans under the revolving credit facility can continue to be drawn/redrawn/outstanding until expiration in 2025. Our future term loan repayments as of December 31, 2022 is as follows: (in thousands) Amount 2023 $ 638   2024 852   2025 852   2026 3,339   Total loan payments $ 5,681   NOTE 12.     Income and Other Taxes During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $ 94,000
and $ 115,000 , respectively. Income tax expense during the three months ended December 31, 2022 is composed primarily of state tax expense and tax expense generated from the tax amortization on acquired indefinitely lived assets. Income tax expense during the three months ended December 31, 2021 is composed primarily of state tax expense which is driven by the State of California's temporary suspension of net operating loss ("NOL") utilization. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 the effective tax rate on continuing operations was
0.8 % and
4.5 %, respectively. The tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2021 is primarily driven by the State of California’s temporary suspension of NOL utilization. The Company uses estimates to forecast the results from continuing operations for the current fiscal year as well as permanent differences between book and tax accounting. We have not provided for income taxes on non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2022 because we plan to indefinitely reinvest the unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries historically have negative earnings and profits. All deferred tax assets have a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022, except for the tax amortization of indefinitely lived goodwill, which cannot be utilized to reduce deferred tax assets. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the positive and negative evidence to assess whether the more likely than not criteria has been satisfied in determining whether there will be further adjustments to the valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, we did
not
accrue any significant uncertain tax benefit, interest, or penalties as tax liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, there were
no
material increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits. NOTE 13.     Commitments and Contingencies Indemnifications 18 Table of Contents We have agreed to indemnify certain customers against claims of infringement of intellectual property rights of others in our sales contracts with these customers. Historically, we have not paid any claims under these customer indemnification obligations. We enter into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers pursuant to which we agree to indemnify them for certain potential expenses and liabilities arising from their status as a director or executive officer of the Company. We maintain directors and officers insurance, which covers certain liabilities relating to our obligation to indemnify our directors and executive officers in certain circumstances. It is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular claim. Legal Proceedings We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and litigation, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of these matters is currently not determinable and we are unable to estimate a range of loss, should a loss occur, from these proceedings. The ultimate outcome of legal proceedings involves judgments, estimates, and inherent uncertainties and the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty.
Professional legal fees are expensed when incurred. We accrue for contingent losses when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable.
In the event that estimates or assumptions prove to differ from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Should we fail to prevail in any legal matter, or should several legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, then the financial results of that particular reporting period could be materially affected. Intellectual Property Lawsuits We protect our proprietary technology by applying for patents where appropriate and, in other cases, by preserving the technology, related know-how, and information as trade secrets. The success and competitive position of our product lines are impacted by our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our research and development efforts. We have, from time to time, exchanged correspondence with third parties regarding the assertion of patent or other intellectual property rights in connection with certain of our products and processes. Resilience Litigation In February 2021, Resilience Capital (“Resilience”) filed a complaint against us with the Delaware Chancery Court containing claims arising from the February 2020 sale of SDI’s real property (the “Concord Property Sale”) located in Concord, California (the “Concord Real Property”) to Eagle Rock Holdings, LP (“Buyer”) and that certain Single-Tenant Triple Net Lease, dated as of February 10, 2020, entered into by and between SDI and the Buyer, pursuant to which SDI leased from the Buyer the Concord Real Property for a
15 -year term. The Resilience complaint seeks, among other items, (a) a declaration that the Concord Property Sale included a non-cash component, (b) a decree requiring us and Resilience to follow the appraisal requirements set forth in that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “SDI Purchase Agreement”), dated as of June 7, 2019, by and among the Company, The Resilience Fund IV, L.P., The Resilience Fund IV-A, L.P., Aerospace Newco Holdings, Inc. and Ember Acquisition Sub, Inc., (c) recovery of Resilience’s costs and expenses, and (d) pre- and post-judgment interest.
In April 2021, we filed with the Delaware Chancery Court our answer to the Resilience complaint and counterclaims against Resilience, in which we are seeking, among other items, (a) dismissal of the Resilience complaint and/or granting of judgment in favor of EMCORE with respect to the Resilience complaint, (b) entering final judgment against Resilience awarding damages to us for Resilience’s fraud and breaches of the SDI Purchase Agreement in an amount to be proven at trial and not less than $ 1,565,000 , (c) a judicial determination of the respective rights and duties of us and Resilience under the SDI Purchase Agreement, (d) an award to us of costs and expenses, and (e) pre- and post-judgment interest. We believe that the claims made by Resilience in its complaint are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against them. NOTE 14.     Equity Equity Plans We provide long-term incentives to eligible officers, directors, and employees in the form of equity-based awards. We maintain
four
equity incentive compensation plans, collectively described as our “Equity Plans”: (a) the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”), (b) the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”), (c) the Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), and (d) the 2022 New Employee Inducement Plan. 19 Table of Contents We issue new shares of common stock to satisfy awards granted under our Equity Plans. In December 2022, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to the 2019 Plan, which, subject to shareholder approval at our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders, would increase the maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2019 Plan by an additional
1.549  million shares.

Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net (loss) income for the period by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), performance stock units (“PSUs”), and stock options as applicable pursuant to the treasury stock method. Certain of the Company's outstanding share-based awards, noted in the table above, were excluded because they were anti-dilutive, but they could become dilutive in the future. The anti-dilutive stock options and shares of outstanding and unvested restricted stock were excluded from the computation of earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 due to the Company incurring a net loss for such period. 20 Table of Contents Future Issuances Common stock reserved for future issuances as of December 31, 2022 was as follows: Amount Exercise of outstanding stock options 9,981   Unvested RSUs and RSAs 2,644,870   Unvested PSUs and PRSAs (at

We do not allocate sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, or interest expense and interest income to our segments because management does not include the information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments. Also, a measure of segment assets and liabilities has not been provided to the Company's chief operating decision maker and therefore is not shown below.

Portions of the Company’s sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. Significant customers are defined as customers representing greater than 10% of consolidated revenue. Revenue from two significant customers represented an aggregate of
38 % and
65 % of our consolidated revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The percentage from significant customers decreased due to lower CATV revenue from our Broadband segment. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in
Financial Statements under Item 1
within this Quarterly Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. See
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
preceding Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Business Overview EMCORE Corporation is a leading provider of sensors for navigation in the aerospace and defense market as well as a manufacturer of chips, laser components, and optical subsystems for use in the Broadband and Cable TV (“CATV”) industries. We pioneered the linear fiber optic transmission technology that enabled the world’s first delivery of CATV directly on fiber, and today are a leading provider of advanced mixed-signal products serving the aerospace and defense and broadband communications markets. The mixed-signal technology, at the heart of our broadband communications products, is shared with our fiber optic gyroscopes (“FOGs”) and other inertial sensors to provide the aerospace and defense markets with state-of-the-art navigation systems technology.
Over the last three years, we have expanded our scope and portfolio of inertial sensor products through the acquisitions of Systron Donner Inertial, Inc. (“SDI”) in June 2019, the Space and Navigation (“S&N”) business of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (“L3H”) in April 2022, and the FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems business (“EMCORE Chicago”) of KVH Industries, Inc. (“KVH”) in August 2022. We have fully vertically-integrated manufacturing capability at our headquarters in Alhambra, CA, and at our facilities in Budd Lake, NJ, Concord, CA, and Tinley Park, IL (the “Tinley Park Facility”). These facilities support our vertically-integrated manufacturing strategy for quartz and FOG products for navigation systems, and for our chip, laser, transmitter, and receiver products for broadband applications.

Recent Developments Acquisition of KVH Industries, Inc. - FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems Business On August 9, 2022, we completed the acquisition of EMCORE Chicago from KVH pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement entered into as of August 9, 2022 by and among the Company, Delta Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and KVH, pursuant to which we acquired substantially all of KVH's assets and liabilities primarily related to its FOG and Inertial Navigation Systems business, including property interests in the Tinley Park Facility for aggregate consideration of approximately $55.0 million, exclusive of transaction costs and expenses and subject to certain post-closing working capital adjustments. Tinley Park Sale and Leaseback Transaction On December 13, 2022, EMCORE Chicago consummated the sale of its real property interest in the Tinley Park Facility to 8400 W 185TH STREET INVESTORS, LLC (the “Tinley Park Buyer”), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $10.3 million. The sale was made pursuant to the terms of that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Tinley Park Purchase Agreement”) dated as of November 1, 2022, by and between EMCORE Chicago and HSRE Fund VII Holding Company, LLC, an affiliate of the Tinley Park Buyer.
In connection with the sale of the real property interests in the Tinley Park Facility, after considering multiple transaction structures, EMCORE Chicago entered into a long-term Single-Tenant Triple Net Lease (the “Lease Agreement”) with Buyer pursuant to which EMCORE Chicago leased back the Tinley Park Facility for a twelve (12) year term commencing on December 13, 2022, unless earlier terminated or extended in accordance with the terms of the Lease Agreement. Wingspire Credit Agreement 23 Table of Contents On August 9, 2022, the Company and EMCORE Space & Navigation Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary (“S&N”), entered into that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2022, among the Company, S&N, the lenders party thereto and Wingspire Capital LLC, as administrative agent for the lenders (“Wingspire”), as amended pursuant to that First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of October 25, 2022, among the Company, S&N, EMCORE Chicago Inertial Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary (together with the Company and S&N, the “Borrowers”), the lenders party thereto and Wingspire, to add EMCORE Chicago as a Borrower and include certain of its assets in the borrowing base (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for two credit facilities: (a) an asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $40.0 million, subject to a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory (subject to certain reserves), and (b) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $5,965,000. The proceeds of the loans made under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will mature on August 8, 2025, and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to term SOFR plus a margin of (i) 3.75% or 5.50% in the case of revolving loans, depending on the applicable assets corresponding to the borrowing base pursuant to which the applicable loans are made and (ii) 5.50% in the case of the term loan. In addition, the Borrowers are responsible for Wingspire’s annual collateral monitoring fees as well as the lenders’ fees and expenses. The Borrowers may also be required to pay an unused line fee of 0.50% in respect of the undrawn portion of the revolving commitments, which is generally based on average daily usage of the revolving facility during the immediately preceding month. The Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants that are generally customary for credit facilities of this type. Among others, the Credit Agreement contains various covenants that, subject to agreed-upon exceptions, limit the Borrowers’ and their respective subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into swap agreements, make loans, acquisitions and investments, change the nature of their business, acquire or sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other persons or entities, declare or pay dividends or make other restricted payments, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into burdensome agreements, change fiscal year, amend organizational documents, and use proceeds to fund any activities of or business with any person that is the subject of governmental sanctions. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that, for any period commencing upon the occurrence of an event of default or excess availability under the Credit Agreement being less than the greater of $5.0 million and 15% of the revolving commitments until such time as no event of default is continuing and excess availability under the Credit Agreement is at least the greater of $5.0 million and 15% of the revolving commitments for a period of 60 consecutive days, the Borrowers satisfy a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10:1.00. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable grace period, would permit the lenders to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable, and exercise rights and remedies available to the lenders under the Credit Agreement or applicable law or equity. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers entered into a pledge and security agreement pursuant to which the obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured on a senior secured basis (subject to permitted liens) by substantially all assets of the Borrowers and substantially all assets of any future guarantors. As of December 31, 2022, an aggregate principal amount of $6.6 million was outstanding pursuant to the revolving credit facility and an aggregate principal amount of $5.7 million was outstanding pursuant to the term loan facility. Acquisition of L3Harris Space and Navigation Business On April 29, 2022, we completed the acquisition of S&N from L3H pursuant to that certain Sale Agreement, dated as of February 14, 2022 (as amended, the “Sale Agreement”), entered into by and among the Company, Ringo Acquisition Sub, Inc. and L3H, pursuant to which we acquired certain intellectual property, assets, and liabilities of S&N for aggregate consideration of approximately $5.0 million, exclusive of transaction costs and expenses and subject to certain post-closing working capital adjustments. Following the completion of the working capital adjustments, the final purchase price was approximately $4.9 million. COVID-19 and Economic Conditions We are subject to ongoing risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The full extent of the COVID-19 impact on operational and financial performance is highly uncertain, out of our control, cannot be predicted and may cause additional challenges to and disruptions of our business, inventory levels, operating results, and cash flows. We continue to analyze on an ongoing basis how COVID-19 related actions could affect our product development efforts, future customer demand, timing of orders, recognized revenue, and cash flows. 24 Table of Contents In addition, the instability of global economic conditions and inflationary risks are adding to the uncertainty of our business. These adverse conditions could result in longer sales cycles, increased costs to manufacture our products and increased price competition. Given the dynamic nature of these macroeconomic conditions, we cannot reasonably estimate their full impact on our ongoing business, results of operations, and overall financial performance. Equity Offering On February 16, 2021, we closed an offering of 6,655,093 shares of our common stock, which included the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase 868,056 additional shares of common stock, at a price to the public of $5.40 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, of approximately $33.1 million. The shares were sold by us pursuant to an underwriting agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC, dated February 10, 2021. Fastrain Transaction As part of the effort to streamline operations and move to a variable cost model in our CATV Optical Transmitters and Components product line, on August 9, 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Fastrain Asset Purchase Agreement”) with each of Shenzhen Fastrain Technology Co., Ltd., a corporation formed under the laws of the P.R.C. (“Shenzhen Fastrain”), and Hong Kong Fastrain Company Limited, a limited liability company incorporated in Hong Kong (“HK Fastrain”, and together with Shenzhen Fastrain, collectively, “Fastrain”), pursuant to which, among other items, Fastrain agreed to purchase certain CATV module and transmitter manufacturing equipment (the “Equipment”) that had been located at the manufacturing facility of our wholly-owned subsidiary, EMCORE Optoelectronics (Beijing) Co., Ltd., a corporation formed under the laws of the P.R.C., for an aggregate price of $6.2 million, all of which has been paid to us as of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Concurrently with the execution of the Fastrain Asset Purchase Agreement, we and Fastrain entered into a Manufacturing Supply Agreement, dated August 9, 2021 (as amended, the “Fastrain Manufacturing Agreement”), pursuant to which Fastrain agreed to manufacture for us, from a manufacturing facility or facilities located in Thailand or Malaysia and for an initial term ending on December 31, 2025, the CATV Optical Transmitters and Components products set forth in the Fastrain Manufacturing Agreement. In the Fastrain Manufacturing Agreement, (a) we agreed to pay certain shortfall penalties in the event that orders for manufactured products are below certain thresholds beginning in calendar year 2021 and continuing through calendar year 2025, and (b) Fastrain agreed to pay certain surplus bonuses to us in the event that deliveries for manufactured products in either of the 24-month periods beginning on January 1, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2022 or beginning on January 1, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2024 exceed certain thresholds. No such shortfall penalties or surplus bonuses had accrued or become payable as of the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Results of Operations The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of revenue: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Revenue 100.0  % 100.0  % Cost of revenue 87.7  62.6  Gross profit 12.3  37.4  Operating expense: Selling, general, and administrative 39.9  17.0  Research and development 21.4  11.0  Severance 1.9  3.1  (Gain) loss on sale of assets (4.7) 0.4  Total operating expense 58.5  31.5  Operating (loss) income (46.2) 5.9  Comparison of Results of Operations
25 Table of Contents Three Months Ended December 31, (in thousands, except percentages) 2022 2021 Change Revenue $ 24,953  $ 42,236  $ (17,283) (40.9) % Cost of revenue 21,894  26,439  (4,545) (17.2) Gross profit 3,059  15,797  (12,738) (80.6) Operating expense: Selling, general, and administrative 9,944  7,187  2,757  38.4  Research and development 5,351  4,627  724  15.6  Severance 1,298  (Gain) loss on sale of assets (1,171) 187  (1,358) (726.2) Total operating expense 14,599  13,299  2,123  16.0  Operating (loss) income (11,540) 2,498  (14,861) (594.9) % Revenue Three Months Ended December 31, (in thousands, except percentages) 2022 2021 Change Aerospace and Defense $ 21,675  $ 9,900  $ 11,775  118.9  % Broadband 3,278  32,336  (29,058) (89.9) Total revenue $ 24,953  $ 42,236  $ (17,283) (40.9) % For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Aerospace and Defense revenue increased compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by higher Inertial Navigation revenue primarily due to the acquisitions of S&N and EMCORE Chicago.
The revenue from these acquisitions was partially offset by decreased sales of QMEMS products due to supply chain issues and manufacturing yields and Alhambra FOG products due to decreased demand in connection with one customer program for single-axis gyros. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Broadband revenue decreased compared to the same period in the prior year, due overwhelmingly to a substantial decline in sales of CATV Optical Transmitter and Components products. This market is historically cyclical. Following a significant COVID-19 related up-cycle during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 and the early part of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we are currently in a down-cycle with substantial inventory build-up in our sales channels. Gross Profit Three Months Ended December 31, (in thousands, except percentages) 2022 2021 Change Aerospace and Defense $ 4,108  $ 1,684  $ 2,424  143.9  % Broadband (1,049) $ 14,113  (15,162) (107.4) Total gross profit $ 3,059  $ 15,797  $ (12,738) (80.6) % Gross profit is revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists of raw materials, compensation expense, depreciation, amortization, accretion, and other manufacturing overhead costs, expenses associated with excess and obsolete inventories, and product warranty costs. Historically, gross profit as a percentage of revenue, which we refer to as gross margin, has fluctuated significantly due to product mix, manufacturing yields, sales volumes, inventory, and specific product warranty charges, as well as the amount of our revenue relative to fixed manufacturing costs.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Aerospace and Defense gross profit increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by the additional contribution from the acquisition of EMCORE Chicago. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, A&D gross margin increased by 20% from 2% to 22% compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of the additional contribution of EMCORE Chicago. 26 Table of Contents For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Broadband gross profit decreased compared to the same period in the prior year due to the substantial drop in product revenue and the associated lower absorption of overhead costs in our wafer fabrication facility. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Broadband gross margin decreased by 35% from negative 3%
to negative 32% compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of the current down-cycle with substantial inventory build-up in our sales channels.. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) consists primarily of personnel-related expenditures for sales and marketing, IT, finance, legal and human resources support functions. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, SG&A increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to expenses related to the S&N and EMCORE Chicago acquisitions, and higher litigation costs, short-term consulting services, and the addition of EMCORE Chicago. Research and Development Research and development (“R&D”) includes personnel-related expenditures, project costs, and facility-related expenses. We intend to continue to invest in R&D programs because they are essential to the future growth of our Aerospace and Defense segment. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Aerospace and Defense R&D expense was $4.3 million and $4.2 million, respectively. R&D increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to R&D associated with the acquired EMCORE Chicago offset by lower project costs. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Broadband R&D expense was $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively. R&D increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the Chip product line. Severance For the three months ended December 31, 2022, severance totaled approximately $0.5 million due to a reduction in force at our Alhambra facility. For the three months ended December 31, 2021 severance totaled approximately $1.3 million associated with the shutdown of manufacturing operations at our Beijing, China facility. (Gain) Loss on Sale of Assets During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company consummated the sale of the real property interests in the Tinley Park Facility to the Tinley Park Buyer, resulting in a gain on sale of assets of $1.2 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold certain equipment and recognized a loss on sale of assets of $0.2 million. Interest Expense, net During the three months ended December 31, 2022, interest expense, net totaled approximately $0.2 million primarily due to the debt outstanding from our Credit Agreement and having lower cash and cash equivalents balance earning interest income. Liquidity and Capital Resources We continue to experience an accumulated deficit but have managed our liquidity position through the sale of assets and cost reduction initiatives. As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents totaled $24.2 million and net working capital totaled $60.7 million. Net working capital, calculated as current assets (including inventory) minus current liabilities, is a financial metric we use which represents available operating liquidity. We have taken a number of actions to continue to support our operations and meet our obligations, including: • In December 2022, we consummated the sale of the real property interests in the Tinley Park Facility to the Tinley Park Buyer, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $10.3 million, pursuant to the terms of the Tinley Park Purchase Agreement. • In August 2022, we entered into the Credit Agreement with Wingspire that provides us with (a) an asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $40.0 million, subject to a borrowing base consisting
27 Table of Contents of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory (subject to certain reserves), and (b) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $5,965,000. As of December 31, 2022, an aggregate principal amount of $6.6 million was outstanding pursuant to the revolving credit facility and an aggregate principal amount of $5.7 million was outstanding pursuant to the term loan facility, and an additional $15.0 million was available for borrowing. See
Note 11 - Credit Agreement  in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Credit Agreement. • In August 2021, we entered into the Fastrain Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which, among other items, Fastrain agreed to purchase certain of our CATV Lasers and Transmitters manufacturing equipment for purposes of outsourcing manufacturing of our CATV Optical Transmitters and Components product lines to Fastrain, for aggregate consideration of $6.2 million. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Recent Developments under the heading “Fastrain Transaction” for additional information regarding the transactions with Fastrain. • In February 2021, we closed our offering of 6,655,093 shares of our common stock at a price of $5.40 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us from the offering of $33.1 million. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Recent Developments under the heading “Equity Offering” for additional information regarding the equity offering. Our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and amounts expected to be available under the Credit Agreement are anticipated to be sufficient financial resources to meet our cash requirements for operations, working capital, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months from the issuance date of these financial statements. We may require more capital than what we are able to generate from operations and the Credit Agreement. To the extent that we may require more capital, we could take additional actions to reduce our expenses and/or elect to raise capital through additional debt or equity issuances, as well as monetization of certain assets. These alternatives may not be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all, and could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, and/or dilution of ownership by our current shareholders. Cash Flow Three Months Ended December 31, (in thousands, except percentages) 2022 2021 Change Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (8,876) $ 6,213  $ (15,089) (242.9) % Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 10,082  $ (1,936) $ 12,018  (620.8) % Net cash used in financing activities $ (3,175) $ (25) $ (3,150) 12,600.0  % For the three months ended December 31, 2022, our operating activities used cash primarily due to our net loss.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, our investing activities provided cash primarily from the sale of the Tinley Park Facility. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, our financing activities used cash for payment to our borrowing facility. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As of the date of this report, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments outside the ordinary course of business since September 30, 2022 as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our condensed consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of December 31, 2022. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting As a result of the acquisition of S&N on April 29, 2022 and EMCORE Chicago on August 9, 2022, management is in the process of reviewing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting relating to S&N and EMCORE Chicago. Certain changes have been made and will continue to be made to our internal controls until management has completed its evaluation and integrated S&N and EMCORE Chicago’s information and accounting systems and processes. In reliance on interpretive guidance issued by the SEC staff permitting a company to exclude an acquired business from management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for one year following the date that the acquisition is completed, we have elected to exclude disclosure of changes in internal control over financial reporting related to S&N and EMCORE Chicago from this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no other changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
