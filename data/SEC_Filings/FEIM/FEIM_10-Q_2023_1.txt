FREQUENCY ELECTRONICS, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
NOTE A – CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In the opinion of management of Frequency Electronics, Inc. (the “Company”), the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly, in all material respects, the condensed consolidated financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2023 and the results of its operations, changes in stockholders’ equity for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, and cash flows for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. The April 30, 2022 condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements. These financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP’). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report and Amended Annual Report on Form 10-K and Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, filed on July 14, 2022 and December 20, 2022, respectively, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Form 10-K” and the “Form 10-K/A”). The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year.
COVID-19 Pandemic, and Other Macroeconomic Factors
The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve as of the date of this report. As such, it is uncertain as to the full magnitude that the pandemic may ultimately have on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, and future financial results. For three and the nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company has been impacted by employee absenteeism related to direct or indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, delays in the receipt of anticipated new contracts from customers administratively affected by the pandemic and limited availability or delivery delays of parts and materials from vendors affected by the pandemic. FEI-Zyfer’s operations were particularly affected as evidenced by decreases in sales and gross margin during fiscal year 2022, which continued during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023. Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global situation on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce. Given the continuing changing dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic the Company is not able to estimate the potential adverse effects on its operations, financial condition, or liquidity for the remainder of fiscal year 2023. The Company has returned to essentially normal operations at its various locations; however, the Company continues to follow federal and state guidelines with an emphasis on employee safety.
The Company may continue to face future COVID-19 related risks, and risks resulting from geopolitical conflicts. The Company is dependent on its workforce to design and manufacture its products. If significant portions of the Company’s workforce are unable to work effectively, or if the U.S. Government, and/or other customers or supplier operations are curtailed due to illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures, or other restrictions, the Company’s operations may be negatively impacted. If faced with any of these factors, the Company may be unable to perform fully on its contracts and costs may increase. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. For example, in the latter part of fiscal year 2021, the Company experienced some operation disruptions due to the need to vacate certain areas of the facilities for cleaning and disinfecting resulting from employees being potentially exposed to COVID-19 or following positive COVID-19 test results. Also, certain Company vendors have been unable to deliver materials on time due to COVID-19 related impacts to their workforces or their supply chains. These delays impacted the Company’s production costs and schedules. Vendor delivery performance is being closely monitored and alternate sources of supply are generally available and, in some cases, are being established.
In addition to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, and future financial results may also be affected by other macroeconomic factors. For example, due to continuing geopolitical circumstances resulting in increased inflation, energy and commodity prices may continue escalating which may adversely affect the Company’s financial results.
NOTE B – EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
Reconciliation of the weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were as follows:

**
For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation of earnings per share since the inclusion of such shares would be antidilutive due to the net loss for those periods. The exercisable shares excluded for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 was
243,625
options, respectively. The exercisable shares excluded for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022 was
223,000
options, respectively.
NOTE C – CONTRACT (LIABILITIES) ASSETS, NET
At January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, contract (liabilities) assets, net, consisted of the following:
January 31, 2023
April 30, 2022
(As Revised)
(In thousands)
Contract Assets
$
8,266
$
8,857

( 18,737
)
( 11,098
)
Net (liability) asset
$
( 10,471
)
$
( 2,241
)
Such amounts represent revenue recognized on long-term contracts that have not been billed at the balance sheet dates or represent a liability for amounts billed in excess of the revenue recognized. Amounts are billed to customers pursuant to contract terms. In general, the recorded amounts will be billed and collected or revenue recognized within twelve months of the balance sheet dates. Revenue on these long-term contracts are accounted for on the percentage-of-completion (“POC”) basis. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, revenue recognized under POC contracts was approximately $ 10.2
million and $ 26.8
million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022, revenue recognized under POC contracts was approximately $ 11.8
million and $ 36.4
million, respectively. If contract losses are anticipated, a loss provision is recorded for the full amount of such losses when they are determinable. Contract losses of approximately $ 537,000 , offset by a loss reduction of approximately $ 1.0
million, mostly related to additional funding, were recorded for the three months ended January 31, 2023. Contract losses of approximately $ 1.5
million were recorded for the nine months ended January 31, 2023. Contract losses of approximately $ 171,000
and $ 218,000
were recorded for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022, respectively.

NOTE F – RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES
The Company’s leases primarily represent offices, warehouses, vehicles, and manufacturing and Research and Development (“R&D”) facilities which expire at various times through 2029 and are operating leases. Contractual arrangements are evaluated at inception to determine if the agreement contains a lease. Certain lease agreements contain renewal options, rent abatement, and escalation clauses that are factored into our determination of lease payments when appropriate. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recorded based on the present
value of future lease payments which will factor in certain qualifying initial direct costs incurred as well as any lease incentives that may have been received. Lease expenses for operating lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease terms may factor in options to extend or terminate the lease.
The Company elected the practical expedient for short-term leases which allows leases with terms of 12 months or less to be recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term without being recognized on the consolidated balance sheets.
The table below presents ROU assets and liabilities recorded on the respective consolidated balance sheets as follows:

As of January 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term for all operating leases was
5.79
years. The Company does not generally have access to the rate implicit in the leases and therefore utilized the Company’s borrowing rate as the discount rate. The Company selected a rate that is reflective of companies with similar credit ratings for secured debt. The weighted average discount rate for operating leases as of January 31, 2023 was
6.21 %.
NOTE G – SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company operates under
two
reportable segments based on the geographic locations of its subsidiaries:
(1)
FEI-NY – operates out of New York and its operations consist principally of precision time and frequency control products used in
three
principal markets: communication satellites (both commercial and U.S. Government-funded); terrestrial cellular telephone or other ground-based telecommunication stations; and other components and systems for the U.S. military.
The FEI-NY segment also includes the operations of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, FEI-Elcom. FEI-Elcom, in addition to its own product line, provides design and technical support for the FEI-NY segment’s communication satellite business.
(2)
FEI-Zyfer – operates out of California and its products incorporate Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies into systems and subsystems for secure communications, both government and commercial, and other locator applications. This segment also provides sales and support for the Company’s wireline telecommunications family of products, including US5G, which are sold in the U.S. market.
The Company measures segment performance based on total revenues and profits generated by each geographic location rather than on the specific types of customers or end-users. Consequently, the Company determined that the segments indicated above most appropriately reflect the way the Company’s management views the business.
The accounting policies of the two segments are the same as those described in the “Summary of Accounting Policies” in the fiscal year-end financial statements included in the Form 10-K/A. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on operating profit (loss), which is defined as income before investment (expense) income, interest expense, other income (expense), and taxes. All acquired assets, including intangible assets, are included in the assets of both reporting segments.

NOTE H – INVESTMENT IN MORION, INC.
The Company has an investment in Morion, Inc. (“Morion”), a privately held Russian company, which manufactures high precision quartz resonators and crystal oscillators. The Company has also licensed certain technology to Morion. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company acquired product from Morion in the aggregate amount of approximately $ 55,000
and $ 86,000 , respectively. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022, the Company acquired product from Morion in the aggregate amount of approximately $ 95,000
and $ 215,000 , respectively. During the nine months ended January 31, 2022, the Company received dividends from Morion in the amount of approximately $ 123,000 , which is included in other income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as part of the FEI-NY segment.
The Company’s investment consists of
4.6 % of Morion’s outstanding shares, accordingly, the Company accounts for its investment in Morion on the cost basis. Morion is a less than wholly owned subsidiary of Gazprombank, a state-owned Russian bank. The U.S. Ukraine-related sanctions regime has since 2014 included a list of sectoral sanctions identifications (“SSI”) pursuant to Executive Order 13662, which prohibits certain transactions, including certain extensions of credit, with an entity designated as an SSI or certain affiliates of an entity designated as an SSI. On July 16, 2014, after the Company’s investment in Morion, Gazprombank was designated as an SSI.
Due to the current Russia-Ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions, the future status of the Company’s equity investment in Morion is uncertain. In response to these conditions, in connection with the preparation of the audited financial statements included in the Form 10-K/A, the Company impaired its investment in Morion in full. The impairment of $ 796,000
is included in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. The likelihood of future sales to, purchases from, and dividend payments from Morion is questionable.

The Company liquidated all holdings related to Marketable Securities during the three months ended January 31, 2023.
During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company sold or redeemed available-for-sale securities of approximately $ 9.8
million and $ 11.0
million, respectively, realizing losses of approximately $ 763,000
and $ 784,000 , respectively, during the respective periods ended January 31, 2023.
The fair value accounting framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
14
Table of Contents
FREQUENCY ELECTRONICS, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level 1
Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.
Level 2
Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
-Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;
-Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets;
-Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and
-Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
Level 3
Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
The asset or liability’s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company’s money market, business account, and U.S. securities were valued on a Level 1 basis. The Company’s fixed income corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit were valued on a Level 2 basis. Level 2 securities are valued at the closing prices and are consistent with quoted prices of similar assets reported in active markets.
NOTE J – RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2017-04,
Intangibles
–
Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment
(“ASU 2017-04”), which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, goodwill impairment will be tested by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company will not be adopting ASU 2017-04 early, and is in the process of determining the effect that ASU 2017-04 may have. However, the Company expects the new standard to have an immaterial effect on its consolidated financial statements when adopted in fiscal year 2024.
NOTE K – CREDIT FACILITY
As of January 31, 2023, the Company retired its credit facility with UBS Bank USA. The Company is considering a new facility, but has sufficient cash to fund its operations.
NOTE L –DEFERRED INCOME TAXES
Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future.
As required by the authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes, we evaluate the realization of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis at each reporting date. We consider all positive and negative evidence, including the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and results of recent operations. Accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence indicating that the deferred tax assets will not be realizable, we establish a valuation allowance. As of January 31, 2023, and April 30, 2022, the Company maintained a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its existing valuation allowance resulting in changes to deferred income tax expense.

Item 2.
Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
“Safe Harbor ”
Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 :
The statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q regarding future earnings and operations and other statements relating to the future constitute “forward-looking” statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Factors that would cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to, the risks associated with health epidemics and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic and similar outbreaks, such as their impact on our financial condition and results of operations and on our ability to continue manufacturing and distributing our products, and the impact of health epidemics and pandemics on general economic conditions, including any resulting recession, our inability to integrate operations and personnel, actions by significant customers or competitors, general domestic and international economic conditions, reliance on key customers, continued acceptance of the Company’s products in the marketplace, competitive factors, new products and technological changes, product prices and raw material costs, dependence upon third-party vendors, competitive developments, changes in manufacturing and transportation costs, the availability of capital, and the outcome of any litigation and arbitration proceedings. The factors listed above are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) of the Form 10-K/A include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict the impact of all these factors on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Any or all of the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q and any other public statement made by the Company or its management may turn out to be incorrect. The Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company believes its most critical accounting policies to be the recognition of revenue and costs on production contracts, income taxes, and the valuation of inventory. Each of these areas requires the Company to make use of reasonable estimates including estimating the cost to complete a contract, the realizable value of its inventory and the market value of its products. Changes in estimates can have a material impact on the Company’s financial position and results of operations. The Company’s significant accounting policies did not change during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied, which is when the expected goods or services are transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to receive. A performance obligation is a distinct product or service that is transferred to the customer based on the contract. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation and is recognized as revenue upon satisfaction of that performance obligation. The Company derives revenue from contracts with customers by units sold with specific specifications and frequencies that are used by a specific customer and contracts where the end user is the government. The Company’s contracts typically include one performance obligation which is satisfied by shipped projects and completed services/reports required in the contract. Control over these performance obligations passes to the customer over time and therefore these revenues are reported in operating results over time using the cost-to-cost method. Under this method, revenue is recorded based upon the ratio that incurred costs bear to total estimated contract costs with related cost of revenues recorded as the costs are incurred. Each month management reviews estimated contract costs through a process of aggregating actual costs incurred and estimating additional costs to completion based upon the current available information and status of the contract. The effect of any change in the estimated gross margin rate (“GM Rate”) for a contract is reflected in revenues in the period in which the change is known. Provisions for the full amount of anticipated losses on contracts are made in the period in which they become determinable.
For smaller contracts or orders, sales of products and services to customers are reported in operating results based upon (i) shipment of the product or (ii) performance of the services pursuant to terms of the customer order. When payment is contingent upon customer acceptance of the installed system, revenue is deferred until such acceptance is received and installation completed. The Company’s products generally carry a one-year warranty, but may vary based on the contract terms.

Table of Contents
FREQUENCY ELECTRONICS, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES
(Continued)
Significant judgment is used in evaluating the financial information for certain contracts to determine an appropriate budget and estimated cost. The Company evaluates this information continuously and bases its judgments on historical experience, design specifications, and expected costs for material and labor. The Company evaluates the amount of development risk associated with new contracts which entail the development of new or significantly modified products and incorporates additional costs to cover these risks. These are estimates based on the Company’s best judgement, but because this entails estimations based on products not heretofore developed, there is risk that the estimates may ultimately prove to be incorrect and that costs are impacted.
Contract costs include all direct material, direct labor, manufacturing overhead and other direct and indirect costs related to contract performance. Selling, general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Inventory
In accordance with industry practice, inventoried costs contain amounts relating to contracts and programs with long production cycles, a portion of which will not be realized within one year. Inventory write downs are established for slow-moving materials based on percentage of usage over a ten-year period, obsolete items on a gradual basis over five years with no usage and costs incurred on programs for which production-level orders cannot be determined as probable. Such write-downs are based upon management’s experience and estimates for future business. Any changes arising from revised estimates are reflected in cost of revenues in the period the revision is made.

For the three months ended January 31, 2023 revenues from commercial and U.S. Government communication satellite programs accounted for approximately 47% of consolidated revenues compared to approximately 62% of consolidated revenues during this same period in the prior fiscal year. Revenues are recognized primarily under the POC method. Revenues from the satellite market are recorded in the FEI-NY segment. Revenues from non-space U.S. Government/Department of Defense (“DOD”) customers, which are recorded in both the FEI-NY and FEI-Zyfer segments, accounted for approximately 47% of consolidated revenues for the three months ended January, 31, 2023 compared to approximately 35% of consolidated revenue during the same period in the prior fiscal year. Other commercial and industrial revenues for the three months ended January 31, 2023 accounted for approximately 6% of consolidated revenue compared to 3% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease in revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was mainly due to timing of the various production phases for products in the satellite market.

For the nine months ended January 31, 2023 revenues from commercial and U.S. Government communication satellite programs accounted for approximately 46% of consolidated revenues compared to approximately 55% of consolidated revenues during this same period in the prior fiscal year. Revenues from non-space U.S. Government/DOD customers accounted for approximately 47% of consolidated revenues for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to approximately 39% of consolidated revenue during the same period of fiscal year 2022. Other commercial and industrial revenues for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 accounted for approximately 7% of consolidated revenue compared to approximately 6% for the nine months ended January 31, 2022. The decrease in revenue for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 was predominately in the satellite market, however, the decline in revenue from non-space U.S. Government/DOD customers also contributed to the decrease in revenue. The decrease is partly due to timing of awards of contracts as well as technical difficulties that were reported at the end of our prior fiscal year, which have been mostly resolved.

For the three months ended January 31, 2023, gross margin and GM Rate increased compared to the same respective periods in the prior fiscal year. The increase in the gross margin and GM Rate was due to higher engineering costs associated with programs in their development phase in the prior year period versus their production phase during the current year period. For the nine months ended January 31, 2023, gross margin and GM Rate decreased compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in gross margin and GM Rate was due to increased engineering costs on development phase programs that experienced particularly complex technical challenges that have since been resolved, minor technical challenges that have been, or will be, resolved reasonably quickly, and the negative cost impacts on some programs due to supply chain delays, influenced by COVID during the nine months ended January 31, 2023. Gross margin was also negatively affected by under absorption of costs due to the decrease in sales during the three month and nine month periods ended January 31, 2023.

For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were approximately 22% and 23%, respectively, of consolidated revenues. The decrease in SG&A expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the prior year period was largely due to a decrease in payroll and associated costs related to the previously announced workforce reduction.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, SG&A expenses were approximately 23% and 25%, respectively, of consolidated revenues. The decrease in SG&A expenses for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the prior year period was largely due to decrease in professional fees, as well as a one-time reduction to deferred compensation expense. The Company continues to monitor expenses looking for additional cost-effective reductions going forward.

R&D expenditures represent investments intended to keep the Company’s products at the leading edge of time and frequency technology and enhance future competitiveness. The R&D rate for the three-month period ended January 31, 2023 was 7% of sales compared to 9% of sales for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The R&D rate for the nine-month period ended January 31, 2023 was 9% of sales compared to 10% of sales for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease in R&D expenditures for both periods of fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to the resolution of fiscal 2022 technical challenges to projects that are now in the production phase. The Company plans to continue to invest in R&D in the future to keep its products at the state of the art.

The estimated annual effective tax rate for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2023 is 0.01%. This calculation reflects estimated income tax expense based on our current year annual pretax income forecast which is offset by the estimated change in the current year valuation allowance. The Company maintains a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company recorded a discrete income tax provision of $3,345 primarily related to an accrual of interest for unrecognized tax benefits. For the three months ended January 31, 2022, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $894.
For the nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company recorded a discrete income tax provision of $5,812 primarily related to an accrual of interest for unrecognized tax benefits. For the nine months ended January 31, 2022, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $3,144.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was an income tax provision of (1.1)% on pretax loss of $313,000 compared to an income tax provision of (0.1)% on pretax loss of $734,000 in the comparable prior fiscal year period. The effective tax rate for the three months ended January 31, 2023 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to domestic losses for which the Company is not recognizing an income tax benefit.
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 was an income tax provision of (0.1)% on pretax loss of $5.7 million compared to an income tax provision of (0.2)% on pretax loss of $1.8 million in the comparable prior fiscal year period. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to domestic losses for which the Company is not recognizing an income tax benefit.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Act”) was signed into U.S. law on August 16, 2022. The Act includes various tax provisions,
including an excise tax on stock repurchases, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives, and a corporate alternative minimum tax that generally applies to U.S. corporations with average adjusted annual financial statement income over a three-year period in excess of $1 billion. The Company does not expect the Act to materially impact its consolidated financial statements.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company’s consolidated balance sheets continue to reflect a strong working capital position of approximately $20.0 million at January 31, 2023 and $34.2 million at April 30, 2022. Included in working capital at January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022 was $12.9 million and $21.5 million, respectively, consisting of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The Company’s current ratio at January 31, 2023 was 1.7 to 1 compared to 2.6 to 1 as of April 30, 2022.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period ended January 31, 2023 was approximately $1.9 million and net cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period ended January 31, 2022 was approximately $4.0 million. The decrease in operating cash flow in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 was mainly due to an increase in net loss and contract liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in non-cash adjustments and contract assets. For the nine-month periods ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred approximately $2.7 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of non-cash operating expenses including ROU assets and liabilities for leases, loss provision accrual, depreciation and amortization, inventory reserve adjustments, deferred compensation, and accruals for employee benefit programs.
Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine-month period ended January 31, 2023 was approximately $8.7 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of approximately $1.6 million for the nine-month period ended January 31, 2022. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, marketable securities were sold or redeemed in the amount of $11.0 million compared to $1.7 million for the same period of fiscal year 2022. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023 approximately $1.4 million of marketable securities were purchased compared to $1.9 million for the same period of fiscal year 2022. The Company acquired property, plant, and equipment in the amount of approximately $886,000 and $1.5 million for the nine-month periods ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 was approximately $9.4 million related to a dividend payout. There was no cash used in or provided by financing activities for the nine months ended January 31, 2022.
The Company has been authorized by its Board of Directors to repurchase up to $5 million worth of shares of its common stock when appropriate opportunities arise. As of January 31, 2023, the Company has repurchased approximately $4 million of its common stock out of the $5 million authorization. For the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 there were no repurchases of shares.
The Company will continue to expend resources for research and development to develop, improve and acquire products for space applications, guidance and targeting systems, and communication systems which management believes will result in future growth and profitability. The Company anticipates securing additional customer funding for a portion of its R&D activities and will allocate internal funds depending on market conditions and identification of new opportunities. The Company expects internally generated cash will be adequate to fund these R&D efforts. The Company may also pursue acquisitions to expand its range of products and may use internally generated cash and external funding in connection with such acquisitions.
As of January 31, 2023, the Company’s consolidated funded backlog was approximately $54 million compared to $40 million at April 30, 2022, the end of fiscal year 2022. Approximately 82% of this backlog is expected to be realized in the next twelve months. As of January 31, 2023, there were no amounts included in backlog under cost-plus fixed-fee contracts that have not been funded. The Company excludes from backlog any contracts or awards for which it has not received authorization to proceed. On fixed price contracts, the Company excludes any unfunded portion. Over time, as partially funded contracts become fully funded, the Company will add the additional funding to its backlog. The backlog is subject to change for various reasons, including possible cancellation of orders, change orders, terms of the contracts and other factors beyond the Company’s control. Accordingly, the backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenues or profits (losses) which may be realized when the results of such contracts are reported.
The Company believes that its liquidity is adequate to meet its operating and investment needs through at least March 17, 2024 and the foreseeable future.
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.

Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on their evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting disclosed below, as of January 31, 2023, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level.
There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s management initially concluded and disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, filed on July 14, 2022 with the SEC (the “Form 10-K”) that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of April 30, 2022.
However, for the reasons discussed below, management conducted a re-assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In conducting its re-assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of April 30, 2022, because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting discussed below.
As disclosed in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 16, 2022, in the course of preparing the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2022, the Company identified errors related to the calculations and presentation of contract assets and contract liabilities in the Form 10-K.
Following the identification of these prior errors, management re-evaluated the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2022 and identified material weaknesses in the following areas:
1.         While previously corrected as of April 30, 2022, historically, through April 30, 2022, the Company had presented contract assets and contract liabilities on a net basis on the consolidated balance sheets whereas ASC 606-10-45-1 requires gross presentation. In addition, a formula error was identified whereby the Company had not been grouping contracts assets and contract liabilities properly on a project-by-project basis. As a result, management has concluded that the Company did not effectively design and maintain controls over the completeness and accuracy of the gross presentation of contract assets and contract liabilities and thus a material weakness was identified; and
23

FREQUENCY ELECTRONICS, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES
(Continued)
2.         In connection with the above, as of April 30, 2021 the Company had presented contract assets and contract liabilities on a net basis on the consolidated balance sheets whereas ASC 606-10-45-1 requires gross presentation. During the process of completing the Company’s Form 10-K, management corrected the contract assets and contract liabilities balances in the April 30, 2021 column of the consolidated balance sheet to present them gross as opposed to net as previously filed. However, this should have been identified as a correction of a prior period error and assessed accordingly to determine whether or not a restatement was needed and whether the error was the result of a deficiency in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, management has concluded that the Company did not have an adequate control in place for identifying and assessing financial statement errors and thus a material weakness was identified.
As disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 16, 2022, by the Company, on December 14, 2022, the Company concluded that the items noted above constituted material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2022 and continued to exist as of January 31, 2023.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Remediation Plan
To remediate the material weaknesses described above, the Company is pursuing the following remediation steps:
1.
Review and update, as necessary, the design and documentation of its internal control policies and procedures with respect to its internal control over financial reporting. The Company plans to implement additional formulas and comparative reviews of financial information as a result of issues identified in its policies and procedures as promptly as practical and to satisfy documentation requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
2.
Ensure that its internal control over financial reporting is properly designed, documented and operating effectively by (i) enhancing the design of existing control activities and/or implementing additional control activities, as needed, (ii) monitoring the operating effectiveness of those controls, and (iii) ensuring that documentation exists to evidence the performance of those controls.
The Company believes that its remediation plan will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weaknesses and strengthen its internal control over financial reporting. However, by April 30, 2023, the Company’s next annual reporting date, there may not be sufficient time for the Company to remediate all material weaknesses or, if remediated, to test the operating effectiveness of the remediated controls. As the Company continues to evaluate, and works to improve, its internal control over financial reporting, management may determine that additional measures to address control deficiencies or modifications to the remediation plan are necessary. The Company cannot assure you, however, when it will remediate such weaknesses, nor can it be certain whether additional actions will be required or the costs of any such actions. Moreover, the Company cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Company is in the process of implementing certain changes in its internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weaknesses described above. Other than the implementation of the remediation plan discussed above, which began in the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2023, there has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
