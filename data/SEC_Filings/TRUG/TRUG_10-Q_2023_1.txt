Organization and Description of Business Operations
The
Company is a blank check company incorporated on July 8, 2020, under the laws of the State of Delaware for the purpose of entering into
a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or
more businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). While the Company may, subject to certain limitations, pursue a Business
Combination target with operations or prospects in the digital healthcare and AI in medicine sector in the global market.
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from July 8, 2020 (inception) through
December 31, 2022, relates to the Company’s formation and its initial public offering (“IPO”), which is described below,
and subsequent to IPO, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues
until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of
interest income from the cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account (as defined below). The Company has selected March
31 as its fiscal year end.
On
October 29, 2021, the Company consummated its IPO of
12,650,000
units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class
A common stock included in the Units, the “Public Shares”) at $ 10.00
per unit, which included
1,650,000
Units issued pursuant
to the full exercise by the Underwriters (as defined below) of their over-allotment option, and the private sale of an aggregate of
519,500
Units (the “Private Placement Units” and with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units, the “Private
Placement Shares”) to its sponsor, Bright Vision Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) and I-Bankers Securities, Inc. (“I-Bankers”)
at a purchase price of $ 10.00
per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds of $ 5,195,000
to the Company that closed simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO. The Company’s securities have been listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”). On December
2, 2021, the Company’s Units no longer traded, and shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and rights underlying the
Units commenced trading separately.
Transaction
costs amounted to $ 7,282,500
consisting of $ 2,530,000
in cash of underwriting commissions, $ 4,427,500
of business combination marketing
fee, and $ 325,000
of other offering costs.
Upon
the closing of the IPO on October 29, 2021, the Company deposited $ 127,765,000
($ 10.10
per Unit) from the proceeds of the IPO and certain
proceeds of the sales of Private Placement Units in the trust account (“Trust Account”), located in the United States and
invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of
185
days or less or in any open-ended investment company that
holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act,
as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds
held in the Trust Account, as described below.

DEEP
MEDICINE ACQUISITION CORP.
NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Following
the closing of the IPO, cash of $ 764,101
was held outside of the Trust Account (as defined below) and is available for working capital
purposes. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had available cash of $ 962,177
on its balance sheet, including $ 754,873
distributed from
the Trust Account for the tax payments, and a working capital deficit of $ 1,325,763 . The Company’s management has broad discretion
with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Units, although substantially
all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination.
On
July 12, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”)
with Chijet Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Chijet”), each of the referenced holders of Chijet’s outstanding
shares (collectively, the “Sellers”), Chijet Motor Company, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chijet (“Pubco”),
and Chijet Motor (USA) Company, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco (“Merger Sub”). Chijet indirectly holds an over
85% interest in Shandong Baoya New Energy Vehicle Co., Ltd., a Chinese company (“Baoya”), which is a producer and manufacturer
of electric vehicles. In addition, Chijet indirectly holds an over
64 % interest in FAW Jilin Automobile Co., Ltd., a Chinese company
(“FAW Jilin”), which manufactures and sells traditional fuel vehicles. On September 6, 2022, the Business Combination Agreement
was amended to extend the due diligence period until and ended on September 20, 2022, which was subsequently extended to September 30,
2022 pursuant to the second amendment of the Business Combination Agreement, dated September 16, 2022. On September 26, 2022, the Company
terminated the Business Combination Agreement and the Company is not obligated to pay any penalties pursuant to the terms of the Business
Combination Agreement as a result of the termination.
The
Company must complete a Business Combination with one or more operating businesses or assets that together have an aggregate fair market
value equal to at least
80 % of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes,
if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions) at the time of the Company’s signing a definitive
agreement in connection with its initial Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction
company owns or acquires
50 % or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target
business or assets sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
The
Company will provide its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a
Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means
of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender
offer will be made by the Company. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount held
in the Trust Account (initially $ 10.10
per share), calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of a Business Combination,
including any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax
obligations. The shares of Class A common stock are recorded at redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion
of the IPO, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.”
The
Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $ 5,000,001
upon such completion
of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor
of the Business Combination.
If
the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to (i) waive its redemption
rights with respect to any shares of Class A common stock held by them in connection with the completion of the Business Combination,
(ii) waive its redemption rights with respect to any shares of Class A common stock held by them in connection with a stockholder vote
to approve an amendment to the Company’s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (a) to modify the substance or
timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem
100 % of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete the Business Combination
within the Combination Period (as defined below) or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or
pre-initial Business Combination activity and (iii) waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect
to the shares of Class B common stock they purchased in March 2021 (the “Founder Shares”) or Private Placement Shares if
the Company fails to complete the Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below). In addition, the Sponsor has
agreed to vote any share it held in favor of the Business Combination.
Additionally,
each public stockholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares, without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote
for or against a proposed Business Combination.

DEEP
MEDICINE ACQUISITION CORP.
NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the
tender offer rules, the Company’s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder,
together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group”
(as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted
from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares without the Company’s prior written
consent.
The
Company initially had until October 29, 2022 (or April 29, 2023 if the Company may extend the period of time to consummate a Business
Combination) (the “Initial Combination Period”) to complete a Business Combination. On October 19, 2022, an aggregate of
$ 1,265,000
was deposited into the Company’s Trust Account to extend the Company’s time to consummate a Business Combination
from October 29, 2022 to January 29, 2023, which amount will be included in the pro rata amount distributed to (i) all of the holders
of the Class A common stock sold in the Company’s IPO (“Public Shares”) upon the Company’s liquidation or (ii)
holders of Public Shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with the consummation of the Company’s initial Business
Combination. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below), the Company
will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than 10 business
days thereafter, redeem
100 % of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then
on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned (less up to $ 50,000
of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the
number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders
(including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such
redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate,
subject in each case to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of
other applicable law.
The
Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares and Private Placement Shares if the Company fails
to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below). However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in
or after the IPO, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete
a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below). The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their
business combination marketing fees (see Note 9) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination
within the Initial Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that
will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value
of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the IPO price per Unit ($ 10.10 ).
The
Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company, if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products
sold to the Company, or by a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement,
reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $ 10.10
per Public Share or (2) such lesser amount per Public Share held
in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of trust assets, in each case
net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third
party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the Company’s
indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party,
the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility
that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers
(other than the Company’s independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business,
execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.
On
December 23, 2022, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders in lieu of an annual meeting of stockholders (the “Meeting”).
At the Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (the “Charter Amendment”)to (i) extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial Business
Combination from January 29, 2023 to July 29, 2023 (the “Combination Period”), or such earlier date as determined by the
Company’s board of directors and (ii) provide for the right of a holder of Class B common stock of the Company to convert into
Class A common stock of the Company on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing of an initial Business Combination. Subsequently, the
Charter Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and stockholders holding all of the issued and outstanding
Class B common stock of the Company elected to convert their Class B common stock into Class A common stock of the Company on a one-for-one
basis. The Combination Period is extended to July 29, 2023, provided that an additional amount of $ 50,000
will be deposited into the
Trust Account for each month after January 29, 2023. In addition,
3,162,500
shares of Class B common stock of the Company were cancelled,
and
3,162,500
shares of Class A Common Stock were issued to such converting Class B stockholders. The
3,162,500
shares of Class A common
stock issued pursuant to the conversion are subject to the same restrictions applicable to the Class B common stock before the conversion,
including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial
Business Combination as described in the prospectus for our IPO. Additionally, stockholders holding
11,819,790
shares of the Public Shares
exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company’s Trust Account. As a result, $ 121,034,650
(approximately $ 10.24
per share) was removed from the Company’s Trust Account to pay such holders. Following redemptions, the Company
had
830,210
Public Shares outstanding.
Underwriting
Agreement and Business Combination Marketing Agreement
The
Company engaged I-Bankers as the representative of the underwriters (the “Underwriters”) in the IPO of the Company’s
Class A common stock for $ 110
million and the simultaneous listing on Nasdaq. Pursuant to that certain underwriting agreement, I-Bankers
acted as the representative of the Underwriters of the IPO for
11,000,000
Units at $ 10.00
per Unit, plus an over-allotment option equal
to
15 % of the number of Units offered, or
1,650,000
Units, which was exercised in full simultaneously upon the closing of the IPO. The
Company paid I-Bankers underwriters’ commission of $ 2,530,000 , equal to 2.0% of the gross proceeds raised in the IPO for such services
upon the consummation of the IPO (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable).

TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Upon
the closing of the IPO, the Company issued to I-Bankers a
five-year
warrant to purchase
632,500
Shares of Class A common stock, equal
to
5.0 % of the Shares issued in the IPO (“Representative Warrants”). The exercise price of Representative Warrants is $ 12.00
per Share. In addition, I-Bankers was issued
101,200
shares of Class A common stock upon the consummation of IPO (“Representative
Shares”).
In
addition, under a business combination marketing agreement, the Company has engaged I-Bankers as an advisor in connection with the Business
Combination and will pay I-Bankers a cash fee for such marketing services upon the consummation of the Business Combination in an amount
equal to, in the aggregate, 3.5% of the gross proceeds of the IPO, including any proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters’
over-allotment option . The fee will become payable to the Underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event
that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
The
Company has principally financed its operations from inception using proceeds from the sale of its equity securities to its stockholders
prior to the IPO, proceeds from related party loan and such amount of proceeds from the IPO that were placed in an account outside of
the Trust Account for working capital purposes. Until the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds
not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective
target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating
the Business Combination.
As
of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company had a loan payable to the Sponsor in amount of $ 500,000
with zero interest pursuant
to the promissory note between the Company and the Sponsor (the “Sponsor Note”). The Sponsor Note is unsecured, and the Sponsor
agrees to fund the Company in amount of up to $ 500,000 . Under no circumstances shall any individual, including but not limited to any
officer, director, employee or stockholder of the Company, be obligated personally for any obligations or liabilities of the Sponsor
Note. These amounts will be repaid upon completion of an initial Business Combination.
On
October 15, 2022, the Company issued two promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $ 1,265,000
(collectively, the “Sponsor
Affiliate Notes”) to two affiliates of the Company’s Sponsor (collectively, the “Sponsor Affiliates”), in connection
with the extension of the Initial Combination Period from October 29, 2022 to January 29, 2023. The Sponsor Affiliate Notes bear no interest
and are repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of the Company’s initial Business Combination, or
(b) the date of the liquidation of the Company.
On
October 19, 2022, an aggregate of $ 1,265,000
was deposited into the Company’s Trust Account, which amount will be included in the
pro rata amount distributed to (i) holders of Public Shares upon the Company’s liquidation or (ii) holders of Public Shares who
elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with the consummation of the Company’s initial Business Combination.
The
Company may need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from its Sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors,
or third parties. The Company’s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to (other than as described above),
loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the
Company’s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable
to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily
be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company
cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
Risks
and Uncertainties
Management
continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that
the virus could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations, and/or search for a target
company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of this financial statement. The financial statement does not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Going
Concern and Management’s Plan
The
Company expects to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans and will not generate any operating revenues until after
the completion of its initial Business Combination. In addition, the Company expects to have negative cash flows from operations as it
pursues an initial Business Combination target. In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in
accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) Topic 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern” the Company does not currently have adequate liquidity to sustain operations, which consist
solely of pursuing a Business Combination.

NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The
Company may raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or its stockholders, officers, directors,
or third parties. The Company’s officers and directors and the Sponsor may, but are not obligated to (except as described above),
loan the Company funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s
working capital needs. Based on the foregoing, the Company believes it will have sufficient cash to meet its needs through the earlier
of consummation of a Business Combination or the deadline to complete a Business Combination pursuant to the Company’s Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (unless otherwise amended by stockholders).
While
the Company expects to have sufficient access to additional sources of capital if necessary, there is no current commitment on the part
of any financing source to provide additional capital and no assurances can be provided that such additional capital will ultimately
be available. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern until the consummation
of a Business Combination or for a period of time within one year after the date that these unaudited financial statements are issued.
There is no assurance that the Company’s plans to raise additional capital (to the extent ultimately necessary) or to consummate
a Business Combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
As
is customary for a special purpose acquisition company, if the Company is not able to consummate a Business Combination during the Combination
Period, it will cease all operations and redeem the Public Shares. Management plans to continue its efforts to consummate a Business
Combination during the Combination Period.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In
August 2020, the FASB issued FASB ASU Topic 2020-06, Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives
and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain
financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion
features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts
in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments
that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including
the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2022 and should be
applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-06
did not have an impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Marketable Securities Held in Trust Account
At
December 31, 2022, substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds, which are invested primarily
in U.S. Treasury securities. The Company’s investments held in the Trust Account are classified as trading securities. Trading
securities are presented on the balance sheet at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the
change in fair value of investments held in Trust Account are included in interest earned on marketable securities held in Trust Account
in the accompanying statements of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in Trust Account are determined using available
market information. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the marketable securities held in the Trust Account were $ 8,965,045
and
$ 127,760,867 , respectively.

6 - Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
The
Company accounts for its common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 “Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured
at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that feature redemption rights that are either within the
control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control)
are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. The Company’s
common stock feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence
of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity,
outside of the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s balance sheet.
The
Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to
equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Immediately upon the closing of the IPO, the Company recognized the remeasurement
from initial book value to redemption value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable common stock resulted in charges against
additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit.
At
December 31, 2022, the common stock subject to redemption reflected in the balance sheet are reconciled in the following table:

Net Loss per Share of Common Stock
The
Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share.” Net loss per share
of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding for
the period. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did
no t have any dilutive securities and other
contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into shares of common stock and then share in the earnings (loss) of the
Company. As a result, diluted loss per share of common stock is the same as basic loss per share of common stock for the period.

Loan
Payable – Related Party
As

In
addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor,

may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working
Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid
only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion
of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used

interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $ 1.5
million of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into private placement-equivalent
units at a price of $ 10.00

Rights
Each
holder of a right will receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Class A common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination. In
the event the Company will not be the surviving entity upon completion of the Company’s initial Business Combination, each holder
of a public right will automatically receive the 1/10 share of Class A common stock underlying such public right (without paying any
additional consideration); and each holder of a Private Placement Right or right underlying Units to be issued upon conversion of the
Working Capital Loans will be required to affirmatively convert its rights in order to receive the 1/10 share of Class A common stock
underlying each right (without paying any additional consideration). If the Company is unable to complete an initial Business Combination
within the required time period and public stockholders redeem the public shares for the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of
rights will not receive any such funds in exchange for their rights and the rights will expire worthless. The Company will not issue
fractional shares upon conversion of the rights. If, upon conversion of the rights, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional
interest in a share, the Company will, upon exchange, comply with Section 155 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Company will
make the determination of how to treat fractional shares at the time of its initial Business Combination and will include such determination
in the proxy materials that it will send to stockholders for their consideration of such initial Business Combination.
If
the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the
Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution
from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless.
Further, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation of a Business
Combination.
Additionally,
in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the rights, and the rights may expire worthless.
Representative
Warrants and Representative Shares
Upon
the closing of the IPO, the Company issued to the Underwriters Representative Warrants, the exercise price of which will be $ 12.00
per
Share, and
101,200
Representative Shares.
The
Representative Warrants shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, commencing the later of October 26, 2022 and the closing of the Company’s
initial Business Combination and terminating on October 29, 2026. The Company accounted for the
632,500
warrants as an expense of the
IPO resulting in a charge directly to stockholders’ equity. The fair value of Representative Warrants was estimated to be approximately
$ 1,333,482
(or $ 2.11
per warrant) using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of the Representative Warrants granted
to the Underwriters was estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of
35 %, (2) risk-free
interest rate of
1.18 % and (3) expected life of
five years . The Representative Warrants and the shares of Class A common stock underlying
Representative Warrants have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a
180 -day lock-up immediately following October
29, 2021 pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1).
The
Representative Warrants grants to holders demand and “piggy back” rights for periods of five and seven years from October
29, 2021. The Company will bear all fees and expenses attendant to registering the securities, other than underwriting commissions which
will be paid for by the holders themselves. The exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Representative Warrants
may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or the Company’s recapitalization, reorganization,
merger or consolidation. However, the Representative Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of Class A common stock at a price below
its exercise price.
The
Underwriters agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Representative Shares without the Company’s prior written consent
until the completion of the Business Combination. The Underwriters agreed (i) to waive its redemption rights with respect to such shares
in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination and (ii) to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from
the Trust Account with respect to the Representative Shares if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within
Initial Combination Period. The shares have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a lock-up for a period of
180 days immediately following October 29, 2021 pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1).

Overview
We
are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange,
asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate
our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Placement Warrants that occurred simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. We have until July 29, 2023 to complete
a Business Combination as described below.
On
July 12, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”)
with Chijet Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Chijet”), each of the referenced holders of Chijet’s outstanding
shares (collectively, the “Sellers”), Chijet Motor Company, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chijet (“Pubco”),
and Chijet Motor (USA) Company, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco (“Merger Sub”). Chijet indirectly holds an over
85% interest in Shandong Baoya New Energy Vehicle Co., Ltd., a Chinese company (“Baoya”), which is a producer and manufacturer
of electric vehicles. In addition, Chijet indirectly holds an over 64% interest in FAW Jilin Automobile Co., Ltd., a Chinese company
(“FAW Jilin”), which manufactures and sells traditional fuel vehicles. On September 6, 2022, the Business Combination Agreement
was amended to extend the due diligence period until and ended on September 20, 2022, which was subsequently extended to September 30,
2022 pursuant to the second amendment of the Business Combination Agreement, dated September 16, 2022. On September 26, 2022, the Company
terminated the Business Combination Agreement and the Company is not obligated to pay any penalties pursuant to the terms of the Business
Combination Agreement as a result of the termination.
On
December 23, 2022, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders in lieu of an annual meeting of stockholders (the “Meeting”).
At the Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (the “Charter Amendment”) to (i) extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial Business
Combination from January 29, 2023 to July 29, 2023 (the “Combination Period”), or such earlier date as determined by the
Company’s board of directors and (ii) provide for the right of a holder of Class B common stock of the Company to convert into
Class A common stock of the Company on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing of an initial Business Combination. Subsequently, the
Charter Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and stockholders holding all of the issued and outstanding
Class B common stock of the Company elected to convert their Class B common stock into Class A common stock of the Company on a one-for-one
basis. The Combination Period is extended to July 29, 2023, provided that an additional amount of $50,000 will be deposited into the
Trust Account for each month after January 29, 2023. In addition,3,162,500 shares of Class B common stock of the Company were cancelled,
and 3,162,500 shares of Class A Common Stock were issued to such converting Class B stockholders. The 3,162,500 shares of Class A common
stock issued pursuant to the conversion are subject to the same restrictions applicable to the Class B common stock before the conversion,
including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial
Business Combination as described in the prospectus for our IPO. Additionally, stockholders holding 11,819,790 shares of the Company’s
Class A common stock (“Public Shares”) exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in
the Company’s Trust Account. As a result, $121,034,650 (approximately $10.24 per share) was removed from the Company’s Trust
Account to pay such holders. Following redemptions, the Company had 830,210 Public Shares outstanding.

We
intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of the Private
Placement Units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial Business Combination (including pursuant to forward
purchase agreements or backstop agreements we entered into following the consummation of the IPO or otherwise), shares issued to the
owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing.
The
issuance of additional shares in connection with an initial Business Combination to the owners of the target or other investors:
●
may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in the IPO;
●
may subordinate the rights of holders of our common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common
stock;
●
could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things,
our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers
and directors;
●
may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person
seeking to obtain control of us; and
●
may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock and/or rights.
Similarly,
if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt to bank or other lenders or the owners of a target, it could result in:
●
default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt
obligations;
●
acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain
covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;
●
our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;
●
our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such
financing while the debt security is outstanding;
●
our inability to pay dividends on our common stock;
●
using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends
on our common stock if declared, our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general corporate
purposes;
●
limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;
●
increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government
regulation;
●
limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements,
and execution of our strategy; and
●
other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.
We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial Business Combination plans. We cannot assure you that our
plans to raise capital or to complete our initial Business Combination will be successful.

Results
of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events
We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational
activities and those necessary to prepare for the IPO and since the IPO, identifying a target company for a Business Combination and
activities in connection with the proposed business combination with Chijet, which was terminated on September 26, 2022. We do not generate
any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination. We have been generating non-operating income in the
form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents after the IPO. Subsequent to the Company’s special meeting of stockholders
held on December 23, 2022, stockholders holding 11,819,790 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion
of the funds in the Company’s Trust Account. As a result, $121,034,650 (approximately $10.24 per share) was removed from the Company’s
Trust Account to pay such holders. Following redemptions, the Company had 830,210 Public Shares outstanding.
After
the IPO, we incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance),
as well as expenses as we conduct due diligence related to a Business Combination. Our expenses increases substantially after the closing
of the IPO.
For
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, we had a net income of $577,351 and $257,372, respectively, which consisted of operating
costs of $415,358 and $1,402,914, respectively, income taxes of $68,415 and $68,415, respectively, offset by interest earned on marketable
securities held in the Trust Account of $1,061,124 and $1,728,701, respectively.
For
the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $135,423 and $230,696, respectively, due solely to the operating
costs.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
The
Company had cash of $962,177 on its balance sheet, including $754,873 distributed from the Trust Account for the tax payments, as of
December 31, 2022, and $877,099 in cash as of March 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company had total current
liabilities of $ current liabilities of $2,369,573 and $536,712, respectively, and total current assets of $10,008,855 and $128,953,272,
respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had working capital deficit of $1,325,763, a decrease of working capital of $1,981,456 as compared
to March 31, 2022, primarily as a result of a decrease in cash and prepaid expenses and an increase in total current liabilities. The
significant increase in accrued expenses as of December 31, 2022 was in connection with the due diligence on Chijet. In addition, on
October 15, 2022, the Company issued the Sponsor Affiliate Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1,265,000 to the Sponsor Affiliates
in connection with the extension of the Initial Combination Period from October 29, 2022 to January 29, 2023. Due to the stockholders’
redemption in December 2022 (as described below), cash and marketable securities held in Trust Account decreased to $8,965,045 as of
December 31, 2022 compared to $127,760,867 as of March 31, 2022. Subsequent to the Company’s special meeting of stockholders held
on December 23, 2022, stockholders holding 11,819,790 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion
of the funds in the Company’s Trust Account. As a result, $121,034,650 (approximately $10.24 per share) was removed from the Company’s
Trust Account to pay such holders.
We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of a Business Combination. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete
the Business Combination will be successful.
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, cash used in operating activities amounted to $669,795, mainly due to the unrealized income
earned on investment held in the Trust Account in amount of $1,728,701, and the decrease in accrued expenses to related parties by $15,000,
offset by the net income of $257,372, the decrease in prepaid expenses by $233,673 and the increase in accrued expenses and taxes payable
by $514,446 and $68,415, respectively. Comparatively, cash of $597,770 used in operating activities during the nine months ended December
31, 2021 was due to the net loss of $230,696, plus the increase in prepaid expenses by $339,030 and the decrease in accrued expenses
to related parties and accrued expenses by $25,000 and $862, respectively.
Cash
flow of $510,127 used in investing activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was due to the distribution from the Trust
Account in amount of $754,873 for taxes payments, offset by the investment of $1,265,000 in the Trust Account to extend the Initial Combination
Period from October 29, 2022 to January 29, 2023. Cash flow of $127,765,000 used in investing activities during the nine months ended
December 31, 2021 was due to the investment of cash in the Trust Account.
18
Cash
flow of $1,265,000 provided by financing activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was due to the proceeds from related
parties’ loans totaled $1,265,000 in connection with the extension of the Initial Combination Period from October 29, 2022 to January
29, 2023. In addition, subsequent to the Company’s special meeting of stockholders held on December 23, 2022, stockholders holding
11,819,790 Public Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company’s Trust
Account. As a result, $121,034,650 (approximately $10.24 per share) was removed from the Company’s Trust Account to pay such holders.
Cash flow of $128,839,900 from financing activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2021 was due primary to the proceeds from
the sale of Units at the closing of the Company’s IPO in amount of $126,500,000, net of underwriting discounts of $2,530,000, the
proceeds from the sale of Private Placement Units in amount of $5,195,000, offset by the payment to the offering costs of $325,000 and
the repayment of $100 to due to related party.
As
of December 31, 2022, we had cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $8,965,045, after the $121,034,650 (approximately
$10.24 per share) was removed from the Company’s Trust Account to pay the redeeming holders, substantially all of which has been
invested in U.S. treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less. Interest income earned on the balance in the Trust Account may be
available to us to pay taxes. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing
interest earned on the Trust Account to complete our initial Business Combination. In December 2022, we withdrew interest of $754,873
to pay franchise and income taxes. We estimate our annual franchise tax obligations, based on the number of shares of our common stock
authorized and outstanding after the completion of the IPO, to be $200,000, which is the maximum amount of annual franchise taxes payable
by us as a Delaware corporation per annum, which we may pay from funds from the IPO held outside of the Trust Account or from interest
earned on the funds held in our Trust Account and released to us for this purpose. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the
amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account. We expect the interest earned on the amount in the
Trust Account will be sufficient to pay our income taxes. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part,
as consideration to complete our initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working
capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.
As
of December 31, 2022, we had available cash of $962,177, including $754,873 distributed from the Trust Account for the tax payments.
We will use these funds to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses,
travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review
corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete an initial Business
Combination.
In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination,
our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may
be required. If we complete our initial Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial Business
Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but
no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such working capital loans may be convertible
into private placement-equivalent units at a price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 165,000
shares of Class A common stock if $1,500,000 of notes were so converted since the 150,000 rights included in such units would result
in the issuance of 15,000 shares upon the closing of our Business Combination), at the option of the lender.
Such
units would be identical to the private placement units. The terms of such working capital loans by our sponsor or its affiliates, or
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect
to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to
loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account.
We
expect our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately $400,000 for our portion of legal, accounting,
due diligence, travel and other expenses associated with structuring, negotiating and documenting successful business combinations; $50,000
for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements; $75,000 for Nasdaq continued listing fees; $155,000 for working
capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves (including taxes net of anticipated interest income); and approximately
$20,000 as fees to our Chief Financial Officer.
These
amounts are estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses. In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being
placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a
down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from “shopping”
around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed
initial business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for
the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop”
provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time.
Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue
searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses.
We
do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following the IPO in order to meet the expenditures required for conducting the
due diligence related to a proposed Business Combination and operating our business during this process. However, if our estimates of
the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial Business Combination, including
the proposed Business Combination, are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or we are unable to complete the proposed Business
Combination, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial Business Combination. Moreover, we
may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem
a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional
securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. In addition, we intend to target businesses larger than we could
acquire with the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the private placement units, and may as a result be required to seek additional
financing to complete such proposed initial Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only
complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial
Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the
Trust Account. In addition, following our initial Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional
financing in order to meet our obligations.

Party Transactions
We
pay Weixuan Luo, our Chief Financial Officer, monthly fees of $5,000 for her services commencing on August 1, 2020. Upon completion of
our initial Business Combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. We will also issue to our officers and
directors an aggregate of 300,000 post business combination shares within 10 days following the Business Combination with the same lock-up
restrictions as the Founder Shares and same registration rights as our Founder Shares.
Our
sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business
combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or
our or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling
on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf.
Prior
to the consummation of the IPO, our sponsor agreed to loan us up to $500,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of the IPO. These
loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due upon completion of our initial Business Combination. As of December 31, 2022 and
March 31, 2022, the loan payable to the Sponsor was $500,000.
In
addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete
our initial Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial Business Combination does not close,
we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust
Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such working capital loans may be convertible into private placement-equivalent
units at a price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 165,000 shares of Class A common stock
if $1,500,000 of notes were so converted since the 150,000 rights included in such units would result in the issuance of 15,000 shares
upon the closing of our Business Combination), at the option of the lender. Such units would be identical to the private placement units.
The terms of such working capital loans by our sponsor or its affiliates, or our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined
and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an
affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all
rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account.
Pursuant
to a registration rights agreement we entered into with our initial stockholders, our sponsor and I-Bankers on or prior to the closing
of the IPO, we are required to register certain securities for sale under the Securities Act. These holders, and holders of units issued
upon conversion of working capital loans, if any, are entitled under the registration rights agreement to make up to three demands that
we register certain of our securities held by them for sale under the Securities Act and to have the securities covered thereby registered
for resale pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders have the right to include their securities in other
registration statements filed by us. We will bear the costs and expenses of filing any such registration statements.
On
October 15, 2022, the Company issued the Sponsor Affiliate Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1,265,000 to the Sponsor Affiliates,
in connection with the extension of the Initial Combination Period from October 29, 2022 to January 29, 2023. The Sponsor Affiliate Notes
bear no interest and are repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of the Company’s initial Business
Combination, or (b) the date of the liquidation of the Company.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations; Quarterly Results
As
of December 31, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not
have any commitments or contractual obligations. No unaudited quarterly operating data is included in this prospectus, as we have conducted
no operations to date.
20
Factors
That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations
Our
results of operations and our ability to complete a Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause
economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by,
among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest
rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including
resurgences and the emergence of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflict in Ukraine. We cannot at this
time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively
impact our business and our ability to complete Business Combination.

4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As
required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried
out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based upon their evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.
We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 covered

risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations.
A
1% U.S. federal excise tax may be imposed on us in connection with our redemptions of shares in connection with a Business Combination
or other stockholder vote pursuant to which stockholders would have a right to submit their shares for redemption (a “Redemption
Event”).
Pursuant
to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “ IR Act ”), commencing in 2023, a 1% U.S. federal excise tax is imposed
on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries
of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation and not on its stockholders. The amount
of the excise tax is equal to 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes
of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against
the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “ Treasury
Department ”) has authority to promulgate regulations and provide other guidance regarding the excise tax. In December 2022,
the Treasury Department issued Notice 2023-2, indicating its intention to propose such regulations and issuing certain interim rules
on which taxpayers may rely. Under the interim rules, liquidating distributions made by publicly traded domestic corporations are exempt
from the excise tax. In addition, any redemptions that occur in the same taxable year as a liquidation is completed will also be exempt
from such tax. Accordingly, redemptions of our Public Shares in connection with an extension may subject us to the excise tax, unless
one of the two exceptions above apply. Redemptions would only occur if an extension proposal is approved by our stockholders and the
extension is implemented by the Board.
Any
redemption or other repurchase may be subject to the excise tax. The extent to which we would be subject to the excise tax in connection
with a Redemption Event would depend on a number of factors, including: (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases
in connection with the Redemption Event, (ii) the nature and amount of any “PIPE” or other equity issuances in connection
with the Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with the Redemption Event but issued within the same taxable year
of the Business Combination), (iii) if we fail to timely consummate a Business Combination and liquidate in a taxable year following
a Redemption Event and (iv) the content of any proposed or final regulations and other guidance from the Treasury Department. In addition,
because the excise tax would be payable by us and not by the redeeming holders, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax
remains to be determined. Any excise tax payable by us in connection with a Redemption Event may cause a reduction in the cash available
to us to complete a Business Combination and could affect our ability to complete a Business Combination.
