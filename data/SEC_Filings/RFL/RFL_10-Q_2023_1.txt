an investment in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals, Inc., formerly known as Rafael Pharmaceuticals Inc., a cancer metabolism-based therapeutics
company, a majority equity interest in LipoMedix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“LipoMedix”), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company,
the activities of the Barer Institute Inc. (“Barer”), a wholly-owned preclinical cancer metabolism research operation, and
Rafael Medical Devices, Inc., a wholly owned orthopedic-focused medical device company developing instruments to advance minimally invasive
surgeries (“Rafael Medical Devices” and together with the Pharmaceutical Companies, the “Healthcare Companies”).
In November 2022, the Company resolved to curtail its early-stage development efforts, including pre-clinical research at Barer. The
decision was taken to reduce spending as the Company focuses on exploring strategic opportunities. The Company’s primary focus
is to invest in, fund, and develop novel cancer therapies. We further seek to expand our portfolio through opportunistic investments
in therapeutics which address high unmet medical needs including through acquisitions and strategic investments.
Historically,
the Company owned multiple real estate assets. In 2020, the Company sold an office building located in Piscataway, New Jersey and, on
August 22, 2022, the Company sold the building at 520 Broad Street in Newark, New Jersey that serves as headquarters for the Company
and several tenants and an associated public garage (the “520 Property”). See Note 3 for further details on the sale transaction.
Currently, the Company holds a portion of a commercial building in Jerusalem, Israel as its remaining real estate asset.
The
Company holds debt and equity investments in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals that includes preferred and common equity interests and a warrant
to purchase additional equity. On June 17, 2021, the Company entered into a merger agreement to acquire full ownership of Cornerstone
Pharmaceuticals in exchange for issuing Company Class B common stock to the other stockholders of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals. On October
28, 2021, the Company announced that the AVENGER 500 Phase 3 clinical trial for CPI-613® (devimistat), Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals’
lead product candidate, did not meet its primary endpoint of significant improvement in overall survival in patients with metastatic
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. In addition, following a pre-specified interim analysis, the independent data monitoring committee for
the ARMADA 2000 Phase 3 study for devimistat recommended the trial to be stopped due to a determination that it was unlikely to achieve
the primary endpoint (the “Data Events”). In connection with the preparation of the Company’s financial statements
for the first quarter ended October 31, 2021, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”)
required that the Company assess the impact of the Data Events and determine whether the carrying values of the Company’s assets
were impaired based upon the Company’s expectations to realize future value. In light of the Data Events, the Company concluded
that the likelihood of further development of and prospects for CPI-613 is uncertain and fully impaired in the first quarter ended October
31, 2021 the value of its loans, receivables, and investment in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals based upon its valuation of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals.
On February 2, 2022, the Company terminated the Merger Agreement with Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals, effective immediately, in accordance
with its terms. Subsequently, on February 2, 2022, the Company withdrew its Registration Statement on Form S-4 related to the proposed
Merger.
In
2019, the Company established Barer, a preclinical cancer metabolism research operation, to focus on developing a pipeline of novel therapeutic
compounds, including compounds to regulate cancer metabolism with potentially broader application in other indications beyond cancer.
Barer has been comprised of scientists and academic advisors that are experts in cancer metabolism, chemistry, and drug development.
In addition to its own internal discovery efforts, Barer pursued collaborative research agreements and in-licensing opportunities with
leading scientists from top academic institutions. Barer’s subsidiary, Farber Partners, LLC (“Farber”), was formed around
one such agreement with Princeton University’s Office of Technology Licensing for technology from the laboratory of Professor Joshua
Rabinowitz, in the Department of Chemistry, Princeton University, for an exclusive worldwide license to its SHMT (serine hydroxymethyltransferase)
inhibitor program. In November 2022, the Company resolved to curtail its early-stage development efforts, including pre-clinical research
at the Barer Institute.

Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions
to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S.
GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments,
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.

The
Company’s fiscal year ends on July 31 of each calendar year. Each reference below to a fiscal year refers to the fiscal year ending
in the calendar year indicated (e.g., fiscal year 2022 refers to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022).
Operating
results for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
fiscal year ending July 31, 2023. The balance sheet at July 31, 2022 has been derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial
statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.
Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and notes thereto
included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022, or the 2022 Form 10-K, as filed with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
Liquidity
As
of January 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $ 9.7
million, and available-for-sale securities
valued at approximately $ 79.2
million. On August 22, 2022, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $ 33
million in connection
with the sale of the 520 Property (see Note 3 for further details). The Company expects the balance of cash and cash equivalents, and
available-for-sale securities to be sufficient to meet our obligations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of these consolidated
financial statements.
Risks
and Uncertainties - COVID-19, War in Ukraine
In
late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV, which causes COVID-19, was identified and has proved to be highly contagious. It
has since spread extensively throughout the world, including the United States, and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health
Organization in March 2020. The Company actively monitors the outbreak, including the spread of new variants of interest, and its potential
impact on the Company’s operations and those of the Company’s holdings.
Even
with growing availability of testing and vaccines and the relaxation of public health measures that were implemented to limit the spread
of the pandemic, there continues to be uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact.
The
Company had implemented a number of measures to protect the health and safety of the Company’s workforce including a voluntary work-from-home
policy for the Company’s workforce who can perform their jobs from home as well as restrictions on discretionary business travel. Most
of our employees have returned to working from the office on a part-time basis.
The
full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company will depend on factors such as the length of time of the pandemic; the responses
of federal, state and local governments; the impact of future variants that may emerge; vaccination rates among the population; the efficacy
of the COVID-19 vaccines; the longer-term impact of the pandemic on the economy and consumer behavior; and the effect on our employees,
vendors, and other partners.
The
short and long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time. The imposition of sanctions
and counter sanctions may have an adverse effect on the economic markets generally and could impact our business and the companies in
which we have investments, financial condition, and results of operations. Because of the highly uncertain and dynamic nature of these
events, it is not currently possible to estimate the impact of the Russian – Ukraine war on our business and the companies in which
we have invested.

Concentration
of Credit Risk and Significant Customers
The
Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. As a result, the Company believes that its accounts receivable credit
risk exposure is limited. For the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, including revenue from discontinued operations, related
parties represented 39% and 43% of the Company’s revenue, respectively, and as of January 31, 2023, there were no customers
that were a concentration of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. For the three and six months ended January 31, 2022, including
revenue from discontinued operations, related parties represented
57 % and
63 % of the Company’s revenue, respectively, and as of
January 31, 2022, two customers, one of which is a related party, represented
65 % and
15 % of the Company’s accounts receivable
balance, respectively.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Reserve
for Receivables
The
Company evaluates accounts receivable, loans, interest and fees receivable for impairment under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
310,
Receivables . The Company also evaluates the reserve for losses and estimates collectability of accounts receivable, loans,
interest and fees receivable based on historical bad debt experience, management’s assessment of the financial condition of individual
companies with which the Company conducts business, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic
conditions.
Investments
The
method of accounting applied to long-term investments, whether consolidated, equity or cost, involves an evaluation of the significant
terms of each investment that explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the operations of the investee and also
include the identification of any variable interests in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The consolidated financial statements
include the Company’s controlled affiliates. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between the consolidated affiliates
are eliminated.
Investments
in businesses that the Company does not control, but in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating
and financial matters, are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which the Company does not have the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial matters are accounted for in accordance with ASC 321,
Investments - Equity Securities .
Investments without readily determinable fair values are accounted for using the measurement alternative which is at cost minus impairment,
if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment
of the same issuer. The Company periodically evaluates its investments for impairment due to declines considered to be other than temporary.
If the Company determines that a decline in fair value is other than temporary, then a charge to earnings is recorded in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and a new basis in the investment is established.
Investments
- Hedge Funds
The
Company accounts for its investments in hedge funds in accordance with ASC 321,
Investments – Equity Securities . Unrealized
gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities is included in unrealized (loss) gain on investments –
Hedge Funds in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Corporate
Bonds and US Treasury Bills
The
Company’s marketable securities are considered to be available-for-sale as defined under ASC 320,
Investments - Debt and Equity
Securities , and are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Realized
gains or losses are released from accumulated other comprehensive loss and into earnings on the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss.

Variable
Interest Entities
In
accordance with ASC 810,
Consolidation , the Company assesses whether it has a variable interest in legal entities in which it
has a financial relationship and, if so, whether or not those entities are variable interest entities (“VIEs”). For those
entities that qualify as VIEs, ASC 810 requires the Company to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and if
so, to consolidate the VIE.
If
an entity is determined to be a VIE, the Company evaluates whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary analysis
is a qualitative analysis based on power and economics. The Company consolidates a VIE if both power and benefits belong to the Company
– that is, the Company (i) has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly influence the VIE’s economic
performance (power), and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially
be significant to the VIE (benefits). The Company consolidates VIEs whenever it is determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary.
Cost
Method Investments
- The Company has determined that Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals (see Note 4) is a VIE; however, the Company has
determined that it is not the primary beneficiary as the Company does not have the power to direct the activities of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals
that most significantly impact Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals’ economic performance. Due to the Data Events on October 28, 2021, the
Company recorded an impairment related to the cost method investment in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals during the three months ended October
31, 2021, and did not report a balance in this investment as of January 31, 2023.
Equity
Method Investments
- The Company has determined that RP Finance, LLC (“RP Finance”), (see Note 5), is a VIE; however,
the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary as the Company does not have the power to direct the activities of
RP Finance that most significantly impact RP Finance’s economic performance and, therefore, is not required to consolidate RP Finance.
The Company accounts for its investment in RP Finance using the equity method of accounting.
Assets
Held-for-Sale and Discontinued Operations
The
Company classifies assets as held-for-sale if all held-for-sale criteria are met pursuant to ASC 360-10,
Property, Plant and Equipment .
Criteria include management commitment to sell the disposal group in its present condition and the sale being deemed probable of being
completed within one year. Assets classified as held-for-sale are not depreciated and are measured at the lower of their carrying amount
or fair value less cost to sell. The Company assesses the fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, each reporting period
it remains classified as held-for-sale and reports any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group,
as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the initial carrying value of the disposal group.
Strategic
changes in the Company’s operations can be considered a discontinued operation if both the operations and cash flows of the discontinued
component have been (or will be) eliminated from the ongoing operations of the Company and the Company will not have any significant
continuing involvement in the operations of the discontinued component after the disposal transaction. The results of the discontinued
operations shall be reflected as a discontinued operation on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and prior
periods shall be recast to reflect the earnings from discontinued operations. As a result of the agreement to sell the 520 Property,
the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the activity related to the sale of the 520 Property as discontinued operations.
The Company determined that the 520 Property met the held-for-sale and discontinued operations criteria as of July 1, 2022. The 520 Property
was disposed of during the three months ended October 31, 2022. See Note 3 for additional information regarding the results, major classes
of assets and liabilities, significant non-cash operating items, and capital expenditures of discontinued operations.

Revenue
Recognition
The
Company applies the five-step approach as described in ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which consists of the following:
(i) identifying the contract with a customer, (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determining the transaction
price, (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (v) recognizing revenue when (or as)
the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The
Company disaggregates its revenue by source within its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As an owner and
operator of real estate, the Company derives the majority of its revenue from leasing office and parking space to tenants at its properties.
In addition, the Company earns revenue from recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance,
real estate taxes and other recoverable costs. Revenue from recoveries from tenants is recorded together with rental income on the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss which is also consistent with the guidance under ASC 842,
Leases .
The
revenue derived from the 520 Property, which included leasing office and parking space to the tenants, is presented within discontinued
operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Contractual
rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income, included within other
assets on the consolidated balance sheets, represents cumulative rental income earned in excess of rent payments received pursuant to
the terms of the individual lease agreements.
The
Company also earned revenue from parking which was derived primarily from monthly and transient daily parking. The monthly and transient
daily parking revenue falls within the scope of ASC 606 and was accounted for at the point in time when control of the goods or services
transfers to the customer and the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied, consistent with the Company’s previous accounting.
The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required rent
payments or parking customers to pay amounts due.
Research
and Development Costs
Research
and development costs and expenses incurred by consolidated entities consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses, stock-based
compensation, fees paid to external service providers, laboratory supplies, costs for facilities and equipment, license costs, and other
costs for research and development activities. Research and development expenses are recorded in operating expenses in the period in
which they are incurred. Estimates have been used in determining the liability for certain costs where services have been performed but
not yet invoiced. The Company monitors levels of performance under each significant contract for external service providers, including
the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with the service providers to reflect the actual amount
expended.
Contingent
milestone payments associated with acquiring rights to intellectual property are recognized when probable and estimable. These amounts
are expensed to research and development when there is no alternative future use associated with the intellectual property.
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the provisions of ASC 718,
Stock-Based Compensation , which requires the recognition
of the fair value of stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the
awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Compensation cost for awards is recognized using the straight-line method
over the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is included in general and administrative expense and research and development expense
in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
11
RAFAEL HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Contingencies
The
Company accrues for loss contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that
it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be
estimated. When the Company accrues for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, the Company records
its best estimate within the range. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the Company accrues the
minimum amount in the range. The Company discloses an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible
that a loss may have been incurred.
Fair
Value Measurements
Fair
value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, which is the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three-tier
hierarchy for inputs used to measure fair value, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, is
as follows:
● Level
1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
● Level
2 - quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and inputs that are
observable for the asset or liability; or
● Level
3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, such as discounted cash flow models or
valuations.
A
financial asset’s or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires
judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
Loss
Per Share
Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to all classes of common stockholders of the Company by the weighted average
number of shares of all classes of common stock outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted loss per share is determined in the
same manner as basic loss per share, except that the number of shares is increased to include restricted stock still subject to risk
of forfeiture and to assume exercise of potentially dilutive stock options using the treasury stock method, unless the effect of such
increase would be anti-dilutive. The Company uses income from continuing operations as the “control number” or benchmark
to determine whether potential common shares are dilutive or anti-dilutive for purposes of reporting earnings (loss) per share for discontinued
operations.
Recently
Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard
setting bodies and are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. The Company believes that the impact of recently issued
standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption.

RAFAEL HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
In
June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13,
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic
326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain
other instruments. For receivables, loans and other instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking “expected
loss” model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities
with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to current practice, except the losses will be recognized
as allowances instead of reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. In addition, an entity will have to disclose significantly
more information about allowances, credit quality indicators and past due securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and will be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment
to retained earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of the new standard on its consolidated
financial statements and intends to adopt the standard on August 1, 2023.
In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06,
Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity
(“ASU 2020-06”), which simplifies an issuer’s accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of
accounting models that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features. ASU 2020-06 also simplifies the settlement assessment
that entities are required to perform to determine whether a contract qualifies for equity classification and makes targeted improvements
to the disclosures for convertible instruments and earnings-per-share (“EPS”) guidance. This update will be effective for
the Company’s fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is
permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities
can elect to adopt the new guidance through either a modified retrospective method of transition or a fully retrospective method of transition.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of the new standard on its financial statements and intends to
adopt the standard as of August 1, 2024.
NOTE
3 – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On
July 1, 2022, the Company determined that the 520 Property met the held-for-sale criteria and the Company therefore classified the 520
Property as held-for-sale in the consolidated balance sheets at July 31, 2022. The sale of the 520 Property also represented a significant
strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. Therefore, the Company has classified
the results of operations related to the 520 Property as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
loss. Depreciation on the 520 Property ceased on July 1, 2022, as a result of the 520 Property being classified as held-for-sale.
On
August 22, 2022, Broad Atlantic Associates, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the sale of the 520 Property for
an aggregate gross purchase price of $ 49.4
million.
The
520 Property was encumbered by a mortgage securing a $ 15
million note payable which was paid off in this transaction. Refer to Note 12
for further information on the note payable. After repaying the note payable, commissions, taxes, and other related costs, the Company
received a net cash amount of approximately $ 33

4 – INVESTMENT IN CORNERSTONE PHARMACEUTICALS
Equity
Investment in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals and Impairment of Cost Method Investment
Cornerstone
Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage, cancer metabolism-based therapeutics company focused on the development and commercialization of
therapies that exploit the metabolic differences between normal cells and cancer cells.
The
Company owns debt and equity interests and rights in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals through a
90 %-owned non-operating subsidiary, Pharma
Holdings, LLC, or Pharma Holdings.
Pharma
Holdings owns
50 % of CS Pharma Holdings, LLC, or CS Pharma, a non-operating entity that owns equity interests in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals.
Accordingly, the Company holds an effective
45 % indirect interest in the assets held by CS Pharma.
A
trust for the benefit of the children of Howard Jonas (Chairman of the Board and Executive Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer
of the Company and Member of the Board of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals) holds a financial instrument (the “Instrument”) that
owns
10 % of Pharma Holdings.
Pharma
Holdings holds 44.0 million shares of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals’ Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and a warrant to increase the
combined ownership of Pharma Holdings and CS Pharma to up to 56% of the fully diluted equity interests in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals
(the “Warrant”). The exercise price of the Warrant is the lower of 70% of the price sold in an equity financing, or $1.25
per share, subject to certain adjustments.
On
March 25, 2020, the Board of Directors of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals extended the expiration date of the Warrant held by Pharma Holdings
to purchase shares of the Warrant from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021, and on August 31, 2020 the Board of Directors of Cornerstone
Pharmaceuticals further extended the expiration date of the Warrant held by Pharma Holdings, LLC to purchase shares of the Warrant to
August 15, 2021.
In connection with the Merger Agreement, the Warrant expiration was extended to April 1, 2022. The Company has asserted
that it may be entitled to a further extension of the Warrant. At this time, the Company does not intend to exercise the Warrant.

Pharma
Holdings also holds certain governance rights in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals including appointment of directors. Pharma Holdings is not
the primary beneficiary of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals as it does not control or direct the activities of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals
that most significantly impact Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals’ economic performance.
CS
Pharma holds
16.7
million shares of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. CS Pharma owned a $ 10
million Series
D Convertible Note, with
3.5 % interest, in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals which was converted to shares of Series D Preferred Stock in January
2019.
The
Company and its subsidiaries collectively own securities representing
51 % of the outstanding capital stock of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals
and
42 % of the capital stock on a fully diluted basis (excluding the remainder of the Warrant).
The
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock has a stated value of $1.25 per share (subject to appropriate adjustment to reflect any stock split,
combination, reclassification or reorganization of the Series D Preferred Stock or any dilutive issuances, as described below). Holders
of Series D Stock are entitled to receive non-cumulative dividends when, as and if declared by the Board of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals,
prior to any dividends to any other class of capital stock of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals, or in the event of any deemed liquidation, proceeds from such liquidation, dissolution
or winding up shall be distributed first to the holders of Series D Stock. Except with respect to certain major decisions, or as required
by law, holders of Series D Stock vote together with the holders of the other preferred stock and common stock and not as a separate
class.
The
Company serves as the managing member of Pharma Holdings, and Pharma Holdings serves as the managing member of CS Pharma, with broad
authority to make all key decisions regarding their respective holdings. Any distributions that are made to CS Pharma from Cornerstone
Pharmaceuticals that are in turn distributed by CS Pharma, will need to be made pro rata to all members, which would entitle Pharma Holdings
to
50 % (based on current ownership) of such distributions. Similarly, if Pharma Holdings were to distribute proceeds it receives from
CS Pharma, it would do so on a pro rata basis, entitling the Company to
90 % (based on current ownership) of such distributions.
The
Company evaluated its investments in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals in accordance with ASC 323,
Investments - Equity Method and Joint
Ventures,
to establish the appropriate accounting treatment for its investment and has concluded that its investment did not meet
the criteria for the equity method of accounting or consolidation and is carried at cost.
The
Company has determined that Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals is a VIE; however, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary
as it does not have the power to direct the activities of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals that most significantly impact Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals’
economic performance. In addition, the interests held in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals are Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and do
not represent in-substance common stock.
The
Instrument holds a contractual right to receive additional shares of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals capital stock equal to
10 % of the fully
diluted capital stock of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals (the “Bonus Shares”) upon the achievement of certain milestones. The additional
10 % is based on the fully diluted capital stock of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals, excluding the remainder for the Warrant, at the time
of issuance. If any of the milestones are met, the Bonus Shares are to be issued without any additional payment.
Pharma
Holdings holds the Warrant as well as other equity and governance rights in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals.
The Company currently owns 51%
of the issued and outstanding equity in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals. Approximately 8% of the issued and outstanding equity is owned by
the Company’s subsidiary CS Pharma and 43% is held by the Company’s subsidiary Pharma Holdings. The Company’s subsidiary
Pharma Holdings holds the Warrant. The Instrument holds 10% of the interest in Pharma Holdings and would need to contribute 10% of any
cash necessary to exercise any portion of the Warrant. Following any exercise, a portion of the Company’s interest in Cornerstone
Pharmaceuticals would continue to be held for the benefit of the other equity holders in Pharma Holdings and CS Pharma. Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals
may also issue additional equity interests, such as employee stock options, which will require the Company to pay additional cash to
maintain the Company’s ownership percentage or exercise the Warrant in full.
The terms of the Warrant provide that it expired on
April 1, 2022; however, the Company has asserted that it may be entitled to a further extension of the Warrant. At this time, the Company
does not intend to exercise the Warrant.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
The
Company has determined that RP Finance is a VIE; however, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary as the Company
does not have the power to direct the activities of RP Finance that most significantly impact RP Finance’s economic performance

its investment in RP Finance. The Company has recognized $ 0
in earnings from its ownership interests of
37.5 % in RP Finance for the three
months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and a loss of $ 0
and $ 575
thousand from its ownership interests of

6 – INVESTMENT IN LIPOMEDIX PHARMACEUTICALS LTD.
LipoMedix
is a development-stage, privately held Israeli company focused on the development of an innovative, safe and effective cancer therapy
based on liposome delivery.
As
of January 31, 2023, the Company held
84 % of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of LipoMedix and has consolidated this investment
from the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
In
March 2021, the Company provided bridge financing in the principal amount of up to $ 400,000
to LipoMedix with a maturity date of September
1, 2021, and an interest rate of
8 % per annum. As of September 1, 2021, LipoMedix was in default on the terms of the loan and as such,
the interest rate has increased to
15 % per annum.
On
November 15, 2021, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with LipoMedix to purchase up to
15,975,000
ordinary shares at
$ 0.1878
per share for an aggregate purchase price of $ 3.0
million (the “LipoMedix SPA”). Additionally, LipoMedix issued the
Company a warrant to purchase up to
15,975,000
ordinary shares at an exercise price of $ 0.1878
per share which expired on November 11,
2022.
As
of the date of the LipoMedix SPA, there was an outstanding loan balance including principal of $ 400
thousand and accrued interest of
$ 21.8
thousand owed by LipoMedix to the Company on a note made by LipoMedix in favor of the Company issued in March 2021. The amount
due on the loan was netted against the approximately $ 3.0
million aggregate purchase price due to LipoMedix, resulting in a cash payment
by the Company of approximately $ 2.6
million in exchange for the
15,975,000
shares purchased. As a result of the share purchase, the
Company’s ownership of LipoMedix increased to approximately
84 % with a noncontrolling interest of approximately
16 %. The Company
recorded approximately $ 8
thousand to adjust the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest to reflect the Company’s increased
ownership interest in LipoMedix’s net assets.

7 – INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The
Company has classified its investments in corporate bonds and U.S. treasury bills as available-for-sale securities. These securities
are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’
equity until realized. Investment transactions are recorded on their trade date. Gains and losses on marketable security transactions
are reported on the specific-identification method. Interest income is accrued daily and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion
of discounts on the corporate bonds and U.S. treasury bills.
The

the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in realized gain on available-for-sale securities.
Maturities
of corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury Bills held as of January 31, 2023 were all due within one year.
Marketable
securities in an unrealized loss position as of January 31, 2023 were not deemed impaired at acquisition and subsequent declines
in fair value are not deemed attributed to declines in credit quality. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will
receive a full recovery of par value on the securities, although there can be no assurance that such recovery will occur.
NOTE
8 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes
the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:
● Level
1
- quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
19
RAFAEL HOLDINGS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
● Level
2
- quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and inputs that
are observable for the asset or liability; or
● Level
3
- unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, such as discounted cash flow models
or valuations.
The
determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement.
The
following is a listing of the Company’s assets required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis and where they are classified

of observable inputs can vary from security to security and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type
of security, whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics
particular to the security. The fair value of these assets is estimated based on information provided by the fund managers or the general

11 – LOSS PER SHARE
Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to all classes of common stockholders of the Company by the weighted average
number of shares of all classes of common stock outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted loss per share includes potentially
dilutive securities such as stock options, unvested restricted stock, warrants to purchase common stock, and other convertible instruments
unless the result of inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
The
securities set forth below have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share for the three and six months ended January
31, 2023 and 2022 because inclusion of all such securities would have been anti-dilutive for all periods presented.
The
following table summarizes the Company’s potentially dilutive securities, in common share equivalents, which have been excluded

as pledgor, and Broad-Atlantic Associates, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Realty (the “Borrower,” and together with the
Company and Realty, the “Borrower Parties”), as borrower, entered into a loan agreement (the “Loan Agreement”)
with 520 Broad Street LLC, a third-party lender (the “Lender”). The Loan Agreement provided for a loan in the amount of $ 15
million (the “Note Payable”) from Lender to Borrower secured by (i) a first mortgage on 520 Broad Street, Newark, New Jersey
07102; and (ii) a first priority security interest in the equity of the Borrower as set forth in the Pledge and Security Agreement between
Realty and Lender.
The
Note Payable bore interest at a rate per annum equal to seven and one-quarter percent (7.25%) from July 9, 2021 through July 31, 2021
and thereafter at an interest rate per annum equal to the 30-day LIBOR Rate, as published in
The Wall Street Journal , plus 6.90%
per annum, but in no event less than seven and one-quarter percent (7.25%) per annum. The Note Payable was due on August 1, 2022, subject
to the Company’s option to extend the maturity date until August 1, 2023 for a fee equal to three-quarters of one percent (0.75%)
of the Note Payable.
The
Loan Agreement contained customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default, as defined in the Loan Agreement,
including covenants and restrictions that, among other things, restricted the Borrower’s ability to incur liens, or transfer, lease
or sell the collateral as defined in the Loan Agreement. A failure to comply with these covenants would have permitted the Lender to
declare the Borrower’s obligations under the Loan Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and
payable. The Company was in compli ance with the covenants
in the Loan Agreement as of July 31, 2022. The Company extended the maturity date to November 1, 2022 and paid an extension fee of
$37,500
on July 29, 2022.
In
connection with the sale of the 520 Property, on August 22, 2022, the Company paid off the outstanding principal balance of $ 15
million
and accrued interest of approximately $ 87,000
on the Note Payable. Refer to Note 3 for further details on the subsequent sale of the

thousand and
accrued interest of $ 21.8

NOTE
14 – INCOME TAXES
During
the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized an income tax provision of $ 5
thousand on loss from continuing
operations before income tax of $ 3.2
million, and $ 4
thousand on a loss from continuing operations before income tax of $ 2.1
million,
respectively. During the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized an income tax provision of $ 10
thousand on
loss from continuing operations before income tax of $ 8.4
million, and $ 4
thousand on a loss from continuing operations before income
tax of $ 130.3
million, respectively. The change in income tax expense in relation to the loss before income tax during the three and
six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the three and six months ended January 31, 2022 was primarily due to differences in the
amount of taxable (loss) income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the associated valuation allowances. As of January 31, 2023 and
2022, the Company recorded valuation allowances for the total deferred tax asset balances.
The
Company anticipates that its assumptions and estimates may change as a result of future guidance and interpretation from the Internal
Revenue Service, the SEC, the FASB, and various other taxing jurisdictions. In particular, the Company anticipates that the U.S. state
jurisdictions will continue to determine and announce their conformity with or decoupling from the Tax Act, either in its entirety or
with respect to specific provisions. Legislative and interpretive actions could result in adjustments to the Company’s balances.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
Rafael Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:RFL), (“Rafael
Holdings,” “we” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company with interests in clinical
and early-stage pharmaceutical companies (the “Pharmaceutical Companies”), including an investment in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., formerly known as Rafael Pharmaceuticals Inc., a cancer metabolism-based therapeutics company, a majority equity interest in LipoMedix
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“LipoMedix”), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company, the activities of the Barer Institute Inc. (“Barer”),
a wholly-owned preclinical cancer metabolism research operation, and Rafael Medical Devices, Inc., a wholly-owned orthopedic-focused medical
device company developing instruments to advance minimally invasive surgeries (“Rafael Medical Devices” and together with
the Pharmaceutical Companies, the “Healthcare Companies”). In November 2022, we resolved to curtail our early-stage development
efforts, including pre-clinical research at the Barer. The decision was taken to reduce spending as we focus on exploring strategic opportunities.
The Company’s primary focus is to invest in, fund, and develop novel cancer therapies. We further seek to expand our portfolio through
opportunistic investments in therapeutics which address high unmet medical needs including through acquisitions and strategic investments.
We are currently evaluating external opportunities to acquire or strategically invest in later stage assets which have the potential to
achieve meaningful clinical milestones, improve the lives of patients and increase our shareholder value.
Historically, the Company owned real estate assets.
In 2020, the Company sold an office building located in Piscataway, New Jersey and on August 22, 2022, the Company sold the building at
520 Broad Street in Newark, New Jersey and an associated public garage. Currently, the Company holds a portion of a commercial building
in Jerusalem, Israel as its remaining real estate asset.
The Company holds debt and equity investments
in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals, that include preferred and common equity interests and a warrant
to purchase additional equity. On June 17, 2021, the Company entered into a merger agreement to acquire full ownership of Cornerstone
Pharmaceuticals in exchange for issuing Company Class B common stock to the other stockholders of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals. On October
28, 2021, the Company announced that the AVENGER 500 Phase 3 clinical trial for CPI-613® (devimistat), Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals’
lead product candidate, did not meet its primary endpoint of significant improvement in overall survival in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma
of the pancreas. In addition, following a pre-specified interim analysis, the independent data monitoring committee for the ARMADA 2000
Phase 3 study for devimistat recommended the trial to be stopped due to a determination that it was unlikely to achieve the primary endpoint
(the “Data Events”). In light of the Data Events, the Company concluded that the prospects for CPI-613 were uncertain and
fully impaired in its financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2022, the value of its loans, receivables, and investment in Cornerstone
Pharmaceuticals based upon its valuation of Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals.
On September 24, 2021, the Company entered into
a Line of Credit Loan Agreement (the “Line of Credit Agreement”) with Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals under which Cornerstone
Pharmaceuticals borrowed $25 million from the Company. Due to the Data Events, the Company recorded a full reserve on the $25 million
due the Company from Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals.
On February 2, 2022, the Company terminated the
Merger Agreement with Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals, effective immediately, in accordance with its terms. Subsequently, on February 2, 2022,
the Company withdrew its Registration Statement on Form S-4 related to the proposed Merger.
In 2019, the Company established the Barer Institute
Inc., an early-stage small molecule research operation focused on developing a pipeline of novel therapeutic compounds, including compounds
to regulate cancer metabolism with potentially broader application in other indications beyond cancer. Barer was led by a team of scientists
and academic advisors considered to be among the leading experts in cancer metabolism, chemistry, and drug development. In addition to
its own internal discovery efforts, Barer pursued collaborative research agreements and in-licensing opportunities with leading scientists
from top academic institutions. Farber Partners, LLC (“Farber”) was formed to support agreements with Princeton University’s
Office of Technology Licensing for technology from the laboratory of Professor Joshua Rabinowitz, in the Department of Chemistry, Princeton
University, including an exclusive worldwide license to its SHMT (serine hydroxymethyltransferase) inhibitor program. The Company also
holds a majority equity interest in LipoMedix Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a clinical stage oncological pharmaceutical company based in Israel.
In addition, the Company has invested in other early-stage pharmaceutical ventures.
32
As of January 31, 2023, the Company’s commercial
real estate holdings consisted of a portion of a commercial building in Israel. On August 22, 2022, the Company completed the sale of
the building at 520 Broad Street in Newark, New Jersey that serves as headquarters for the Company for a purchase price of approximately
$49.4 million and realized net proceeds of approximately $33 million.
On July 1, 2022, the Company determined that the
520 Property met the held-for-sale criteria and the Company has therefore classified the 520 Property as held-for-sale in the consolidated
balance sheets at July 31, 2022. The sale of the 520 Property also represents a significant strategic shift that will have a major effect
on the Company’s operations and financial results. Therefore, the Company has classified the results of operations related to the
520 Property as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Depreciation on the 520 Property
has ceased on July 1, 2022, as a result of the 520 Property being classified as held-for-sale. See Note 3 to our accompanying consolidated
financial statements for further information regarding discontinued operations.
On February 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement
with LipoMedix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. in which LipoMedix sold 70,000,000 ordinary shares to the Company at a price per share of $0.03 and
an aggregate sale price of approximately $2.1 million.
In connection with Patrick Fabbio’s January 27, 2023 departure
as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, the Company and Mr. Fabbio entered into a Separation and General Release Agreement (the
“Separation Agreement”), which provides, among other things, that we shall pay Mr. Fabbio severance in the amount of $307,913,
which is included in selling, general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for
the three and six months ended January 31, 2023.
In connection with the termination of Mr. Fabbio’s position as
Chief Financial Officer, there was a material forfeiture of his Class B restricted shares and stock options resulting in a reversal of
approximately $915 thousand in stock-based compensation expense that was previously recorded to selling, general and administrative expense.
On November 21, 2021, Ameet Mallik resigned as
Chief Executive Officer, effective January 31, 2022. In connection with his resignation, there was a material forfeiture of the former
CEO’s Class B restricted shares, resulting in a reversal of approximately $19.0 million in stock-based compensation expense that
was previously recorded to selling, general and administrative expense. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement,
we paid $5.0 million relating to his severance payout, which is included in selling, general and administrative expense on the consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and six months ended January 31, 2022.
Business Update - COVID-19, War in Ukraine
In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV,
which causes COVID-19, was identified and has proved to be highly contagious. It has since spread extensively throughout the world, including
the United States, and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. The Company actively monitors the
outbreak, including the spread of new variants of interest, and its potential impact on the Company’s operations and those of the Company’s
holdings.
Even with growing availability of testing and
vaccines and the relaxation of public health measures that were implemented to limit the spread of the pandemic, there continues to be
uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact.
33
The Company had implemented a number of measures
to protect the health and safety of the Company’s workforce including a voluntary work-from-home policy for the Company’s workforce who
can perform their jobs from home as well as restrictions on discretionary business travel. Most of our employees have returned to working
from the office on a part-time basis.
The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
Company will depend on factors such as the length of time of the pandemic; the responses of federal, state and local governments; the
impact of future variants that may emerge; vaccination rates among the population; the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines; the longer-term
impact of the pandemic on the economy and consumer behavior; and the effect on our employees, vendors, and other partners.
The short and long-term implications of Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time. The imposition of sanctions and counter-sanctions may have an adverse effect
on the economic markets generally and could impact our business and the companies in which we have investments, financial condition, and
results of operations. Because of the highly uncertain and dynamic nature of these events, it is not currently possible to estimate the
impact of the Russian - Ukraine War on our business and the companies in which we have invested.
Results of Operations
Our business consists of two reportable segments
- Healthcare and Real Estate. We evaluate the performance of our Healthcare segment based primarily on research and development efforts
and results of clinical trials, and our Real Estate segment based primarily on results of operations. Accordingly, the income and expense
line items below loss from operations are only included in the discussion of consolidated results of operations.
Healthcare Segment

To date, the Healthcare segment has not generated
any revenues. The entirety of the expenses in the Healthcare segment relate to the activities of LipoMedix, Barer, Farber, and Rafael
Medical Devices. As of January 31, 2023, we held a 100% interest in Barer, an 84% interest in LipoMedix, a 93% interest in Farber, and
a 100% interest in Rafael Medical Devices.
General and administrative expenses . General
and administrative expenses consist mainly of payroll, stock-based compensation expense, benefits, facilities, consulting and professional
fees. The increase in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the three months
ended January 31, 2022 is primarily due to a net increase in stock-based compensation of approximately $11.2 million due to a material
forfeiture in the three months ended January 31, 2022, partially offset by a decrease in severance pay of approximately $5.1 million,
a decrease in payroll expense of approximately $1.7 million, a decrease of approximately $0.4 million in legal expense, a decrease of
approximately $0.1 million in other general and administrative expenses, and a decrease in professional fees of approximately $0.1 million.
The decrease in general and administrative expenses
during the six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the six months ended January 31, 2022 is primarily due to a decrease in severance
expense of approximately $5.1 million, a decrease in payroll expense of approximately $2.5 million, a decrease in legal expense of approximately
$1.0 million, a decrease in professional fees of approximately $0.8 million, and a decrease in other general and administrative expenses
of approximately $0.5 million, offset by a net increase in stock based compensation expense of approximately $4.5 million due to a material
forfeiture in the six months ended January 31, 2022.
Research and development expenses.
Research
and development expenses decreased for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal
2022. Research and development expenses are derived from activity at Barer, LipoMedix, Farber, and Rafael Medical Devices. In November
2022, the Company resolved to curtail its early-stage development efforts, including pre-clinical research at the Barer Institute. The
decision was taken to reduce spending as the Company focuses on exploring strategic opportunities.
Loss on line of credit.
Due to the Data
Events, in the six months ended January 31, 2022, the Company recorded a full reserve on the $25 million due to the Company from Cornerstone
Pharmaceuticals related to the Line of Credit Agreement.
Loss on related party receivables.
Due
to the Data Events, in the six months ended January 31, 2022, the Company recorded a loss of approximately $10.1 million related to the
full reserve recorded on the RP Finance receivable of $9.375 million, and a full reserve recorded on the Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals receivable
of $720 thousand.
Real Estate Segment
The revenue and expenses of the 520 Property have
been excluded from the real estate segment in the figures below due to its classification of held-for-sale and discontinued operations,
and the sale of the 520 Property on August 22, 2022. The Real Estate segment consists of a portion of a commercial building in Israel.
Our consolidated income and expenses for our Real Estate segment were as follows:

quarter of 2022 for administrative, finance, accounting, tax, and legal services. As of July 31, 2022, Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals owed
the Company $720 thousand, for which a full allowance for uncollectibility has been recorded.
General and administrative expenses . General
and administrative expenses consist mainly of payroll, benefits, facilities, consulting and professional fees. The decrease in general
and administrative expenses of approximately $3 thousand and $23 thousand during the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared
to the three and six months ended January 31, 2022 is primarily due to a decrease in professional fees.

ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the interest income earned on our investments in available-for-sale
securities.

We recorded an impairment loss of $67 thousand and $223 thousand for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, respectively, related
to our investment in Nanovibronix using the measurement alternative.

to our cost method investment in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals in the amount of $79 million.
Realized gain on available-for-sale securities .
We recorded a realized gain of approximately and $139 thousand and $154 thousand related to the sale of available-for-sale securities
for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, respectively.
Unrealized (loss) gain on investments - Hedge

ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Equity in (loss) earnings of RP Finance.
We recognized a loss of $575 thousand from our ownership interest in RP Finance for the six months ended January 31, 2022. As of July
31, 2022, the equity method investment in RP Finance on our balance sheet was $0, and no additional equity loss of RP Finance was recorded
subsequent to the year ended July 31, 2022.
Income (loss) from discontinued operations
related to 520 Property.
Discontinued operations include: (i) rental and parking revenues, (ii) payroll, benefits, facilities, consulting
and professional fees dedicated to 520 Property, (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses, (iv) interest (including amortization of
debt issuance costs) on the note payable on the Property, and (v) gain on the disposal of the building. The operating results of these
items are presented in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
The decrease in the net loss attributable to discontinued operations for the three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the three
months ended January 31, 2022 was due to a $1.0 million decrease in rental revenue, slightly offset by an approximate $397 thousand decrease
in interest expense, a $627 thousand decrease in general and administrative expenses (which is primarily comprised of a decrease in real
estate taxes, utilities, other building related repairs and maintenance expenses totaling approximately $615 thousand), and a $363 thousand
decrease in depreciation and amortization expense due to no depreciation expense during the three months ended January 31, 2023 as depreciation
stopped as of July 1, 2022 when the 520 Property was classified as held-for-sale.
37
The increase in the net income attributable to
discontinued operations for the six months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the six months ended January 31, 2022 was due to a gain
on the sale of the 520 Property of $6.8 million, an approximate $707 thousand decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a $1.6
million decrease in rental revenue, a $999 thousand decrease in general and administrative expenses (which is primarily comprised of a
decrease in real estate taxes, utilities other building related repairs, maintenance expenses, and other expenses totaling approximately
$1.1 million, slightly offset by a $129 thousand increase in expense related to the write-off of deferred rental income), and a $726 thousand
decrease in depreciation and amortization expense due to no depreciation expense during the six months ended January 31, 2023 as depreciation
stopped as of July 1, 2022 when the 520 Property was classified as held-for-sale.
See Note 3 to our accompanying consolidated financial
statements for further information regarding discontinued operations.
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests.
The change in the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was due to an approximate $17.3 million loss related to the Cornerstone
Pharmaceuticals impairment loss (the total impairment loss was approximately $79 million) which was applicable to noncontrolling interests
in certain of the Company’s subsidiaries and was allocated to the holders of interests in CS Pharma and Pharma Holdings in the approximate
amounts of $10.4 million and $6.9 million, respectively, for the six months ended January 31, 2022.

Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2023, we held cash and
cash equivalents of approximately $9.7 million, and available-for-sale securities valued at approximately $79.2 million. On August 22,
2022, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $33 million in connection with the sale of the 520 Property (see Note 3 for further
details). The Company expects the balance of cash and cash equivalents, and available-for-sale-securities, to be sufficient to meet our
obligations for at least the 12 months from the filing of this Quarterly Report in Form 10-Q.
Operating Activities
The decrease in cash used in operating activities
for the six months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the six months ended January 31, 2022 was primarily related to lower net loss
from continuing operations of $8.5 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022, and the impact from
non-cash items, primarily stock-based compensation of $1.1 million, an impairment loss of $0.2 million on our investment in Nanovibronix,
and a net unrealized loss on investments - Hedge Funds of $0.3 million. This is coupled with an increase in accounts payable and accrued
expenses of $0.2 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.8 million, as well as other changes in assets
and liabilities.
Cash used in operating activities for the six
months ended January 31, 2022 was primarily related to the net loss from continuing operations of $130.9, offset by the impact from non-cash
items, primarily the impairment of cost method investment in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals of $79 million, the reserve on the amounts due
to the Company from Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals related to the Line of Credit Agreement for $25 million, the reserve on receivables due
from Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals totaling $10.1 million, and stock-based compensation, net of $(3.1) million, as well as other changes
in assets and liabilities.

offset by proceeds of $71.4 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities.
Cash used in investing activities for the six
months ended January 31, 2022 was primarily related to amounts loaned to Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals of approximately $25 million pursuant
to the Line of Credit Agreement and the payments to fund our portion of advances under the line of credit between RP Finance and Cornerstone
Pharmaceuticals in the amount of approximately $1.9 million.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities for the six
months ended January 31, 2023 was primarily related to payments for taxes related to shares withheld for employee taxes.

stock to investors and a related party, partially offset by payment of transaction costs of $6.2 million.
We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common
stock until we achieve sustainable profitability and retain certain minimum cash reserves. The payment of dividends in any specific period
will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors.

Trends and Uncertainties – COVID-19,
War in Ukraine
In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV,
which causes COVID-19, was identified and has proved to be highly contagious. It has since spread extensively throughout the world, including
the United States, and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. The Company actively monitors the
outbreak, including the spread of new variants of interest, and its potential impact on the Company’s operations and those of the Company’s
holdings.
Even with growing availability of testing and
vaccines and the relaxation of public health measures that were implemented to limit the spread of the pandemic, there continues to be
uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact.
The Company had implemented a number of measures
to protect the health and safety of the Company’s workforce including a voluntary work-from-home policy for the Company’s workforce who
can perform their jobs from home as well as restrictions on discretionary business travel. Most of our employees have returned to working
from the office on a part-time basis.
The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
Company will depend on factors such as the length of time of the pandemic; the responses of federal, state and local governments; the
impact of future variants that may emerge; vaccination rates among the population; the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines; the longer-term
impact of the pandemic on the economy and consumer behavior; and the effect on our employees, vendors, and other partners.
The short and long-term implications of Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time. The imposition of sanctions and counter-sanctions may have an adverse effect
on the economic markets generally and could impact our business and the companies in which we have investments, financial condition, and
results of operations. Because of the highly uncertain and dynamic nature of these events, it is not currently possible to estimate the
impact of the Russian – Ukraine war on our business and the companies in which we have investments.
Critical Accounting Estimates
We have chosen accounting policies that we believe
are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We apply these
accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, “Description of Business
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K, for fiscal 2022 (“2022 Form 10-K”).
The application of critical accounting policies
requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related
disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation. If actual
results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual
amounts become known. The critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation
of our consolidated financial statements, or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors, are discussed in “Part II, Item
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the Company’s 2022 Form
10-K. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and procedures during the six months ended January 31, 2023.
40
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any “off-balance sheet arrangements,”
as defined in relevant SEC regulations, that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results
of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Discontinued Operations
In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, ASC 205-20,
Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations , the results of operations of a component of
an entity or a group or component of an entity that represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on the reporting
company’s operations that has either been disposed of or is classified as held-for-sale are required to be reported as discontinued
operations in a company’s consolidated financial statements. In order to be considered a discontinued operation, both the operations
and cash flows of the discontinued component must have been (or will be) eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company and the
company will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the discontinued component after the disposal transaction.
As a result of the agreement to sell the 520 Property, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the activity related
to the sale of the 520 Property as discontinued operations. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information
regarding the results, major classes of assets and liabilities, significant non-cash operating items, and capital expenditures of discontinued
operations.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk
There have been no significant changes in our
market risk exposures from those described in Item 7A of our 2022 Form 10-K.
We are monitoring the potential impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine on our business and the companies in which we have investments. While the potential economic
impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to assess or predict, the impact on the global financial markets
may reduce our ability to access capital, which could negatively impact our long-term liquidity.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of the end of the period covered
by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2023.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 31, 2023 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
