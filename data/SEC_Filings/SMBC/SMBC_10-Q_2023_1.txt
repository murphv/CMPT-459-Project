Southern Bank Real Estate Investments, LLC is a real estate investment trust (REIT) which is controlled by SB Real Estate Investments, LLC, and has other preferred shareholders in order to meet the requirements to be a REIT. At December 31, 2022, assets of the REIT were approximately $ 1.3
billion, and consisted primarily of real estate loan participations acquired from the Bank. The Bank is primarily engaged in providing a full range of banking and financial services to individuals and corporate customers in its market areas. The Bank and Company are subject to competition from other financial institutions. The Bank and Company are subject to the regulation of certain federal and state agencies and undergo periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. Basis of Financial Statement Presentation.
The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and general practices within the banking industry. In the normal course of business, the Company encounters two significant types of risk: economic and regulatory. Economic risk is comprised of interest rate risk, credit risk, and market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest-bearing liabilities reprice on a different basis than its interest-earning assets. Credit risk is the risk of default on the Company’s investment or loan portfolios resulting from the borrowers’ inability or unwillingness to make contractually required payments. Market risk reflects changes in the value of the investment portfolio, collateral underlying loans receivable, and the value of the Company’s investments in real estate. Principles of Consolidation.
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
-9-
Table of Contents financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, estimated fair values of purchased loans, and certain other assumptions and judgmental factors relating to investment securities. Cash and Cash Equivalents.
For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash, due from depository institutions and interest-bearing deposits in other depository institutions with original maturities of three months or less. Interest-bearing deposits in other depository institutions were $ 4.3
million and $ 47.3
million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The deposits are held in various commercial banks with a total of $ 1.8
million and $ 5.8
million exceeding the FDIC’s deposit insurance limits at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, as well as at the Federal Reserve and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Des Moines and Chicago. Interest-bearing Time Deposits.
Interest bearing deposits in banks mature within
seven years
and are carried at cost. Available for Sale Securities.
Available for sale securities (“AFS”), which include any security for which the Company has no immediate plan to sell but which may be sold in the future, are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders’ equity. All securities have been classified as available for sale. Premiums and discounts on debt securities are amortized or accreted as adjustments to income over the estimated life of the security using the level yield method. Realized gains or losses on the sale of securities is based on the specific identification method. The fair value of securities is based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. The Company does not invest in collateralized mortgage obligations that are considered high risk. For AFS securities with fair value less than amortized cost that management has no intent to sell and believes that it more likely than not will not be required to sell prior to recovery, only the credit loss component of the impairment is recognized in earnings, while the noncredit loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The credit loss component recognized in earnings is identified as the amount of principal cash flows not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security as projected based on cash flow projections, and is recorded to the Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”), by a charge to provision for credit losses. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Both the ACL and the adjustment to net income may be reversed if conditions change. However, if the Company intends to sell an impaired AFS security, or, if it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell such a security before recovering its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment amount would be recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the security’s amortized cost basis. Because the security’s amortized cost basis is adjusted to fair value, there is no ACL in this situation. The Company evaluates impaired AFS securities at the individual level on a quarterly basis, and considers factors including, but not limited to: the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or geographic area; the payment structure of the security and likelihood of the issuer to be able to make payments that may increase in the future; failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; and the ability and intent to hold the security until maturity. A qualitative determination as to whether any portion of the impairment is attributable to credit risk is acceptable. There were no credit related factors underlying unrealized losses on AFS securities at December 31, 2022, or June 30, 2022. Changes in the ACL are recorded as expense. Losses are charged against the ACL when management believes the uncollectability of an AFS debt security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. -10-
Table of Contents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank Stock.
The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) systems. Capital stock of the Federal Reserve and the FHLB is a required investment of the Bank based upon a predetermined formula and is carried at cost. Loans.
Loans are generally stated at unpaid principal balances, less the ACL, any net deferred loan origination fees, and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Interest on loans is accrued based upon the principal amount outstanding. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when, in management’s judgment, the collectability of interest or principal in the normal course of business is doubtful. The Company complies with regulatory guidance which indicates that loans should be placed in nonaccrual status when 90 days past due, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan that is “in the process of collection” may be subject to legal action or, in appropriate circumstances, through other collection efforts reasonably expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status in the near future. A loan is considered delinquent when a payment has not been made by the contractual due date. Interest income previously accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against interest income. Cash receipts on a nonaccrual loan are applied to principal and interest in accordance with its contractual terms unless full payment of principal is not expected, in which case cash receipts, whether designated as principal or interest, are applied as a reduction of the carrying value of the loan. A nonaccrual loan is generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are current, full collectability of principal and interest is reasonably assured, and a consistent record of performance has been demonstrated. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans, and is established through provision for credit losses charged to current earnings. The ACL is increased by the provision for losses on loans charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off, net of recoveries. Loans are charged off in the period deemed uncollectible, based on management’s analysis of expected cash flows (for non-collateral dependent loans) or collateral value (for collateral-dependent loans). Subsequent recoveries of loans previously charged off, if any, are credited to the allowance when received. Management estimates the ACL using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adjustments may be made to historical loss information for differences identified in current loan-specific risk characteristics, such as differences in underwriting standards or terms; lending review systems; experience, ability, or depth of lending management and staff; portfolio growth and mix; delinquency levels and trends; as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in economic activity or employment, agricultural economic conditions, property values, or other relevant factors. The Company generally incorporates a reasonable and supportable forecast period of four quarters, and a four-quarter, straight-line reversion period to return to long-term historical averages. The ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. For loans that do not share general risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools, the Company estimates credit losses on an individual loan basis, and these loans are excluded from the collectively evaluated pools. An ACL for an individually evaluated loan is recorded when the amortized cost basis of the loan exceeds the discounted estimated cash flows using the loan’s initial effective interest rate or the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans. For the collectively evaluated pools, the Company segments the loan portfolio primarily by loan purpose and collateral into
24
pools, which are homogeneous groups of loans that possess similar loss potential characteristics. The Company primarily utilizes the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology for measurement of the required ACL. For a limited number of pools with a relatively small balance of unpaid principal balance, the Company utilizes the remaining life method. The DCF model implements probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) calculations at the instrument level. PD and LGD are determined based on statistical analysis and correlation of historical losses with various economic factors over time. In general, the Company’s losses have not correlated well with economic factors, and the Company has utilized peer data where more appropriate. The Company defines a default to include an event of charge off, an adverse (substandard or worse) internal credit rating, becoming delinquent 90 days or more, or being
-11-
Table of Contents placed on nonaccrual status. A PD/LGD estimate is applied to a projected model of the loan’s cashflow, including principal and interest payments, with consideration for prepayment speeds, principal curtailments, and recovery lag.
Loans acquired in a business combination that have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are considered purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans. At the acquisition date, an estimate of expected credit losses is made for groups of PCD loans with similar risk characteristics and individual PCD loans without similar risk characteristics. This initial ACL is allocated to individual PCD loans and added to the purchase price or acquisition date fair values to establish the initial amortized cost basis of the PCD loans. As the initial ACL is added to the purchase price, there is no credit loss expense recognized upon acquisition of a PCD loan. Any difference between the unpaid principal balance of PCD loans and the amortized cost basis is considered to relate to non-credit factors and results in a discount or premium. Discounts and premiums are recognized through interest income on a level-yield method over the life of the loans. Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred, and the net fee or cost is recognized as an adjustment to interest income using the interest method over the contractual life of the loans. Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures.
Off-balance sheet credit instruments include commitments to make loans, and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for off-balance sheet loan commitments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. The ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is estimated by loan pool on a quarterly basis under the current CECL model using the same methodologies as portfolio loans, taking into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur and is included in other liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company records an ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures, unless the commitments to extend credit are unconditionally cancelable.
Foreclosed Real Estate.
Real estate acquired by foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs, establishing a new cost basis. Costs for development and improvement of the property are capitalized. Valuations are periodically performed by management, and an allowance for losses is established by a charge to operations if the carrying value of a property exceeds its estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs. Loans to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired in foreclosure are discounted if made at less than market rates. Discounts are amortized over the fixed interest period of each loan using the interest method. Premises and Equipment.
Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and include expenditures for major betterments and renewals. Maintenance, repairs, and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When property is retired or sold, the retired asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss taken into income. The Company reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment loss recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets. Depreciation is computed by use of straight-line and accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives are generally
seven
to
forty years
for premises,
three
to
seven years
for equipment, and
three years
for software. Bank Owned Life Insurance.
Bank owned life insurance policies are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at the estimated cash surrender value. Changes in the cash surrender value of these policies, as well as a portion of the insurance proceeds received, are recorded in noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. -12-
Table of Contents Goodwill.
The Company’s goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. A qualitative assessment is performed to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not the fair value is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill. If, based on the evaluation, it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, then goodwill is tested further for impairment. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, a goodwill impairment is indicated and goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. Subsequent increases in goodwill value are not recognized in the financial statements. As of June 30, 2022, there was
no
impairment indicated, based on a qualitative assessment of goodwill, which considered: the market value of the Company’s common stock, concentrations of credit; profitability; nonperforming assets; capital levels; and results of recent regulatory examinations. The Company believes there was
no
impairment of goodwill at December 31, 2022. Intangible Assets.
The Company’s intangible assets at December 31, 2022 included gross core deposit intangibles of $ 17.0
million with $ 12.3
million accumulated amortization, gross other identifiable intangibles of $ 3.8
million with accumulated amortization of $ 3.8
million, and mortgage and SBA servicing rights of $ 2.6
million. At June 30, 2022, the Company’s intangible assets included gross core deposit intangibles of $ 17.0
million with $ 11.5
million accumulated amortization, gross other identifiable intangibles of $ 3.8
million with accumulated amortization of $ 3.8
million, and mortgage and SBA servicing rights of $ 2.7
million. The Company’s core deposit intangible assets are being amortized
using the straight line method , over periods ranging from
five
to
seven years , with amortization expense expected to be approximately $ 803,000
in the remainder of fiscal 2023, $ 1.6
million in fiscal 2024, $ 1.1
million in fiscal 2025, $ 581,000
in fiscal 2026, $ 253,000
in fiscal 2027, and $ 417,000
thereafter. As of June 30, 2022, there was
no
impairment indicated, and the Company believes there was
no
impairment of other intangible assets at December 31, 2022. Income Taxes.
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with income tax accounting guidance (ASC 740, Income Taxes). The income tax accounting guidance results in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues. The Company determines deferred income taxes using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management’s judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, on income taxes as a component of income tax expense. The Company files consolidated income tax returns with its subsidiaries, the Bank and SB Real Estate Investments, LLC, with a tax year ended June 30. Southern Bank Real Estate Investments, LLC files a separate REIT return for federal tax purposes, and also files state income tax returns with a tax year ended December 31. Incentive Plans.
The Company accounts for its Equity Incentive Plan (EIP), and Omnibus Incentive Plan (OIP) in accordance with ASC 718, “Share-Based Payment.”
Compensation expense is based on the market price of the Company’s stock on the date the shares are granted and is recorded over the vesting period. The difference between the grant-date fair value and the fair value on the date the shares are considered earned represents a tax benefit to the Company that is recorded as an adjustment to income tax expense.

Table of Contents Outside Directors’ Retirement.
The Bank entered into directors’ retirement agreements beginning in April 1994 for non-employee directors and for new non-employee directors through December 2014. These directors’ retirement agreements provide that each participating non-employee director (participant) shall receive, upon termination of service on the Board on or after age 60, other than termination for cause, a benefit in equal annual installments over a five year period. The benefit will be based upon the product of the participant’s vesting percentage and the total Board fees paid to the participant during the calendar year preceding termination of service on the Board. The vesting percentage shall be determined based upon the participant’s years of service on the Board. In the event that the participant dies before collecting any or all of the benefits, the Bank shall pay the participant’s beneficiary. Benefits shall not be payable to anyone other than the beneficiary, and shall terminate on the death of the beneficiary. Stock Options.
Compensation cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued, and recognized over the vesting period during which an employee provides service in exchange for the award. Earnings Per Share.
Basic earnings per share available to common stockholders is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share available to common stockholders includes the effect of all weighted-average dilutive potential common shares (stock options and restricted stock grants) outstanding during each period. Comprehensive Income.
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income taxes. Other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on available-for-sale securities, unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on available-for-sale securities for which a portion of an other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized in income, and changes in the funded status of defined benefit pension plans. Transfers Between Fair Value Hierarchy Levels.
Transfers in and out of Level 1 (quoted market prices), Level 2 (other significant observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) are recognized on the period ending date. New Accounting Pronouncements: In March 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, creating a forbearance program for federally backed mortgage loans, protects borrowers from negative credit reporting due to loan accommodations related to the National Emergency, and provides financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings (TDR) for a limited period of time to account for the effects of COVID-19. The Company elected to not apply ASC Subtopic 310-40 for loans eligible under the CARES Act, based on the modification’s (1) relation to COVID-19, (2) execution for a loan that was not more than 30-days past due as of December 31, 2019, and (3) execution between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of the date that falls 60 days following the termination of the declared National Emergency, or December 31, 2020. The 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act, signed into law in December 2020, extended the window during which loans could have been modified without classification as TDRs under ASC Subtopic 310-40, to the earlier of January 1, 2022, or 60 days following the termination of the declared National Emergency. ​ In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): “Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,”.  The amendments in this update provide optional guidance for a limited period to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. It provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments in this update are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022.
Pursuant to the Interagency Statement on LIBOR Transition issued in November 2020, the Company will not enter into any new LIBOR-based credit agreements after December 31, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. ​ -14-
Table of Contents In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope. ASU 2021-01 clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in ASC 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. ASU 2021-01 also amends the expedients and exceptions in ASC 848 to capture the incremental consequences of the scope clarification and to tailor the existing guidance to derivative instruments affected by the discounting transition. ASU 2021-01 was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied through December 31, 2022. ASU 2021-01 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs in ASC 310-40, “Receivables – Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors” for entities that have adopted the CECL model introduced by ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2022-02 also requires that public business entities disclose current-period gross charge offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326-20, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses – Measured at Amortized Cost.” ASU 2022-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, for entities that have adopted the amendments in ASU 2016-13 Update, and is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. -15-

individual securities which have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and
27
individual securities which have been in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. The securities are performing and are of high credit quality. The unrealized losses were caused by increases in market interest rates since purchase or acquisition. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is likely that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company has not recorded an ACL on these securities.

-17-
Table of Contents these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company has not recorded an ACL on these securities. At December 31, 2022, corporate obligations included
two
pooled trust preferred securities with an estimated fair value of $ 797,000
and unrealized losses of $ 182,000
in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more. These unrealized losses were primarily due to the long-term nature of the pooled trust preferred securities, a reduced demand for these securities, and concerns regarding the issuers of the underlying trust preferred securities. A cash flow analysis performed as of December 31, 2022, for these
two
securities indicated it is probable the Company will receive all contracted principal and related interest projected. The cash flow analysis used in making this determination was based on anticipated default, recovery, and prepayment rates, and the resulting cash flows were discounted based on the yield spread anticipated at the time the securities were purchased. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is likely that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company has not recorded an ACL on these securities. Other securities.
The unrealized losses on the Company’s investments in other securities includes
eight
individual securities which has been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and
one
individual securities which have been in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. The securities are performing and are of high credit quality. The unrealized loss was caused by increases in market interest rates since purchase or acquisition. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it likely that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company has not recorded an ACL on these securities. MBS and CMOs . As of December 31, 2022, the unrealized losses on the Company’s investments in MBS and CMOs include
85
individual securities which have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, and
40
individual securities which have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. The securities are performing and are of high credit quality. The unrealized losses were caused by increases in market interest rates since purchase or acquisition. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is likely that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company has not recorded an ACL on these securities. The Company does not believe that any individual unrealized loss as of December 31, 2022, is the result of a credit loss. However, the Company could be required to recognize an ACL in future periods with respect to its available for sale investment securities portfolio. Credit losses recognized on investments.

2,686,198 ​ The Company’s lending activities consist of origination of loans secured by mortgages on one- to four-family residences and commercial and agricultural real estate, construction loans on residential and commercial properties, commercial and agricultural business loans and consumer loans. At December 31, 2022 the Bank had purchased participations in
38
loans totaling $ 63.6
million, as compared to
31
loans totaling $ 70.0
million at June 30, 2022. Residential Mortgage Lending.
The Company actively originates loans for the acquisition or refinance of one- to four-family residences. This category includes both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage (“ARM”) loans amortizing over periods of up to
30 years , and the properties securing such loans may be owner-occupied or non-owner-occupied. Single-family residential loans do not generally exceed
90 % of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price of the secured property. Substantially all of the one- to four-family residential mortgage originations in the Company’s portfolio are located within the Company’s primary lending area. General risks related to one- to four-family residential lending include stability of borrower income and collateral values. The Company also originates loans secured by multi-family residential properties that are often located outside the Company’s primary lending area but made to borrowers who operate within our primary lending area. The majority of the multi-family residential loans that are originated by the Company are amortized over periods generally up to
25 years , with balloon maturities typically up to
ten years . Both fixed and adjustable interest rates are offered and it is typical for the Company to include an interest rate “floor” and “ceiling” in the loan agreement. Generally, multi-family residential loans do not exceed 85% of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price of the secured property. General risks related to multi-family residential lending include rental demand and supply, rental rates, and vacancies, as well as collateral values and borrower leverage. -19-
Table of Contents Commercial Real Estate Lending.
The Company actively originates loans secured by owner- and non-owner-occupied commercial real estate including farmland, single- and multi-tenant retail properties, restaurants, hotels, land (improved and unimproved), nursing homes and other healthcare facilities, warehouses and distribution centers, convenience stores, automobile dealerships and other automotive-related services, and other businesses. These properties are typically owned and operated by borrowers headquartered within the Company’s primary lending area, however, the property may be located outside our primary lending area. Risks to owner-occupied commercial real estate lending generally include the continued profitable operation of the borrower’s enterprise, as well as general collateral values, and may be heightened by unique, specific uses of the property serving as collateral. Non-owner-occupied commercial real estate lending risks include tenant demand and performance, lease rates, and vacancies, as well as collateral values and borrower leverage. These factors may be influenced by general economic conditions in the region, or in the United States generally. Risks to lending on farmland include unique factors such as commodity prices, yields, input costs, and weather, as well as farmland values. Most commercial real estate loans originated by the Company generally are based on amortization schedules of up to
25 years
with monthly principal and interest payments. Generally, the interest rate received on these loans is fixed for a maturity of up to
ten years , with a balloon payment due at maturity. Alternatively, for some loans, the interest rate adjusts at least annually after an initial period up to
seven years . The Company typically includes an interest rate “floor” in the loan agreement. Generally, improved commercial real estate loan amounts do not exceed 80% of the lower of the appraised value or the purchase price of the secured property. Agricultural real estate terms offered differ slightly, with amortization schedules of up to
25 years
with an 80% loan-to-value ratio, or
30 years
with a 75% loan-to-value ratio. Construction Lending.
The Company originates real estate loans secured by property or land that is under construction or development. Construction loans originated by the Company are generally to finance the construction of owner occupied residential real estate, or to finance speculative construction of residential real estate, land development, or owner-operated or non-owner occupied commercial real estate. During construction, these loans typically require monthly interest-only payments, with single-family residential construction loans having maturities ranging from
six
to
twelve months , while multi-family and commercial construction loans typically mature in
12
to
36 months . Once construction is completed, permanent construction loans may be converted to monthly payments using amortization schedules of up to
30 years
on residential and generally up to
25 years
on commercial real estate. Construction and development lending risks generally include successful timely and on-budget completion of the project, followed by the sale of the property in the case of land development or non-owner-occupied real estate, or the long-term occupancy of the property by the builder in the case of owner-occupied construction. Changes in real estate values or other economic conditions may impact the ability of a borrower to sell property developed for that purpose. While the Company typically utilizes relatively short maturity periods to closely monitor the inherent risks associated with construction loans for these loans, weather conditions, change orders, availability of materials and/or labor, and other factors may contribute to the lengthening of a project, thus necessitating the need to renew the construction loan at the balloon maturity. Such extensions are typically executed in incremental
three month
periods to facilitate project completion. The Company’s average term of construction loans is approximately
12 months . During construction, loans typically require monthly interest-only payments which may allow the Company an opportunity to monitor for early signs of financial difficulty should the borrower fail to make a required monthly payment. Additionally, during the construction phase, the Company typically performs interim inspections which further allow the Company opportunity to assess risk. At December 31, 2022, construction loans outstanding included
58
loans, totaling $ 35.5
million, for which a modification had been agreed to. At June 30, 2022, construction loans outstanding included
57
loans, totaling $ 13.8
million, for which a modification had been agreed to. In general, these modifications were solely for the purpose of extending the maturity date due to conditions described above, pursuant to the Company’s normal underwriting and monitoring procedures. As these modifications were not executed due to financial difficulty on the part of the borrower, they were not accounted for as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). -20-
Table of Contents Consumer Lending . The Company offers a variety of secured consumer loans, including home equity, direct and indirect automobile loans, second mortgages, mobile home loans and loans secured by deposits. The Company originates substantially all of its consumer loans in its primary lending area. Usually, consumer loans are originated with fixed rates for terms of up to
66 months , with the exception of home equity lines of credit, which are variable, tied to the prime rate of interest and are for a period of
ten years . Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are secured with a deed of trust and are issued up to
100 % of the appraised or assessed value of the property securing the line of credit, less the outstanding balance on the first mortgage and are typically issued for a term of ten years. Interest rates on the HELOCs are generally adjustable. Interest rates are based upon the loan-to-value ratio of the property with better rates given to borrowers with more equity. Risks related to HELOC lending generally include the stability of borrower income and collateral values. Automobile loans originated by the Company include both direct loans and a smaller amount of loans originated by auto dealers. The Company generally pays a negotiated fee back to the dealer for indirect loans. Typically, automobile loans are made for terms of up to
66 months
for new and used vehicles. Loans secured by automobiles have fixed rates and are generally made in amounts up to
100 % of the purchase price of the vehicle. Risks to automobile and other consumer lending generally include the stability of borrower income and borrower willingness to repay. Commercial Business Lending . The Company’s commercial business lending activities encompass loans with a variety of purposes and security, including loans to finance accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and operating lines of credit, including agricultural production and equipment loans. The Company offers both fixed and adjustable rate commercial business loans. Generally, commercial loans secured by fixed assets are amortized over periods up to
five years , while commercial operating lines of credit or agricultural production lines are generally for a
one year
period. Commercial lending risk is primarily driven by the borrower’s successful generation of cash flow from their business enterprise sufficient to service debt, and may be influenced by factors specific to the borrower and industry, or by general economic conditions in the region or in the United States generally. Agricultural production or equipment lending includes unique additional risk factors such as commodity prices, yields, input costs, and weather, as well as farm equipment values. Allowance for Credit Losses.
The provision for credit losses for the three- and six- month periods ended December 31, 2022, was $ 1.1
million and $ 6.2
million, respectively, compared to
no
provision and a recovery of $ 305,000
in the same period of the prior fiscal year. Increased provisioning in the three- month period ended December 31, 2022, was attributed primarily to increased allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure during the quarter, while increased provisioning in the six-month period was attributable primarily to loan growth.
The Company has estimated its expected credit losses as of December 31, 2022, under ASC 326-20, and management believes the ACL as of that date was adequate based on that estimate. There remains, however, significant uncertainty as economic activity recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Federal Reserve withdraws accommodative monetary policy that was put into effect to respond to the pandemic and its economic impact. Management continues to closely monitor borrowers most affected by mitigation efforts, most notably including our borrowers in the hotel industry.
Projections for GDP growth and unemployment, key drivers in the Company’s ACL model, have weakened. As a percentage of average loans outstanding, the Company recorded net charge offs of two basis points (annualized) during the first six months of fiscal 2023, compared to less than one basis point (annualized) during the same period of the prior fiscal year. Specifically, management considered the following:
​ ●  economic conditions and projections as provided by Moody’s Analytics, including baseline and downside scenarios, were utilized in the Company’s estimate at December 31, 2022. Economic factors considered in the projections included national and state levels of unemployment, and national and state rates of inflation-adjusted growth in the gross domestic product. Economic conditions are considered to be a moderate and increasing risk factor, relative to June 30, 2022; ​ ● the pace of growth of the Company’s loan portfolio, exclusive of acquisitions or government guaranteed loans, relative to overall economic growth. This measure is considered to be a moderate and increasing risk factor; ​ -21-
Table of Contents ● levels and trends for loan delinquencies nationally and in the region. This measure as reported remains relatively stable, and the level of uncertainty about loan delinquencies is considered to be diminishing. This is considered to be a moderate and declining risk factor; ​ ● exposure to the hotel industry, in particular, metropolitan area hotels which were negatively impacted by activity restrictions and a lack of business or convention-related travel. This is considered to be an elevated and stable risk factor. ​ PCD Loans.
In connection with the acquisition of Fortune Financial Corporation (“Fortune”) on February 25, 2022, the Company acquired loans both with and without evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination. Acquired loans are recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition with no carryover from the acquired institution’s previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses. Acquired loans are accounted for under ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses.
​ The fair value of acquired loans recorded at the time of acquisition is based upon several factors, including the timing and payment of expected cash flows, as adjusted for estimated credit losses and prepayments, and then discounting these cash flows using comparable market rates. The resulting fair value adjustment is recorded in the form of a premium or discount to the unpaid principal balance of the respective loans. As it relates to acquired loans that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination (“PCD”), the net premium or net discount is adjusted to reflect the Company’s allowance for credit losses recorded for PCD loans at the time of acquisition, and the remaining fair value adjustment is accreted or amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the respective loans. As it relates to loans not classified as PCD (“non-PCD”) loans, the credit loss and yield components of their fair value adjustment are aggregated, and the resulting net premium or net discount is accreted or amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the respective loans. The Company records an ACL for non-PCD loans at the time of acquisition through provision expense, and therefore, no further adjustments are made to the net premium or net discount for non-PCD loans. ​ Loans that the Company acquired from Fortune, that at the time of acquisition had more-than-insignificant deterioration of credit quality since origination, are classified as PCD loans and presented in the table below at acquisition carrying value: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (dollars in thousands)      February 25, 2022 PCD Loans: ​ ​ ​ Purchase price of PCD loans at acquisition ​ $

2,179 ​ ​ Credit Quality Indicators . The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed on all loans at origination, and is updated on a quarterly basis for loans risk rated Watch, Special Mention, Substandard, or Doubtful. In addition, lending relationships of $ 3
million or more, exclusive of any consumer or owner-occupied residential loan, are subject to an annual credit analysis which is prepared by the loan administration department and presented to a loan committee with appropriate lending authority. A sample of lending relationships in excess of $ 1
million (exclusive of single-family residential real estate loans) are subject to an independent loan review annually, in order to verify risk ratings. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Watch  – Loans classified as watch exhibit weaknesses that require more than usual monitoring. Issues may include deteriorating financial condition, payments made after due date but within 30 days, adverse industry conditions or management problems. Special Mention  – Loans classified as special mention exhibit signs of further deterioration but still generally make payments within 30 days. This is a transitional rating and loans should typically not be rated Special Mention for more than 12 months. Substandard  – Loans classified as substandard possess weaknesses that jeopardize the ultimate collection of the principal and interest outstanding. These loans exhibit continued financial losses, ongoing delinquency, overall poor financial condition, and insufficient collateral. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful  – Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses of substandard loans, and have deteriorated to the level that there is a high probability of substantial loss. Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be
Pass
rated loans. A periodic review of selected credits (based on loan size and type) is conducted to identify loans with heightened risk or probable losses and to assign risk grades. The primary responsibility for this review rests with loan administration personnel. This review is supplemented with periodic examinations of both selected credits and the credit review process by the Company’s internal audit function and applicable regulatory agencies. The information from these reviews assists management in the timely identification of problems and potential problems and provides a basis for deciding whether the credit continues to share similar risk characteristics with collectively evaluated loan pools, or whether credit losses for the loan should be evaluated on an individual loan basis. -24-

no
PCD loans that were greater than 90 days past due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not adversely classified or determined to not share similar risk characteristics with collectively evaluated pools of loans for determination of the ACL estimate. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Significant payment delays or shortfalls may lead to a determination that a loan should be individually evaluated for estimated credit losses. Collateral Dependent Loans.
The following table presents the Company’s collateral dependent loans and related ACL at December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      December 31, 2022 ​ ​ Amortized cost basis of ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ loans determined to be ​ Related allowance (dollars in thousands) ​ collateral dependent ​ for credit losses Residential real estate loans   ​      ​    1- to 4-family residential loans   $

no
nonaccrual loans individually evaluated for which no ACL was recorded. Interest income recognized on nonaccrual loans in the three-and six- month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was immaterial. Troubled Debt Restructurings . TDRs are evaluated to determine whether they share similar risk characteristics with collectively evaluated loan pools, or must be individually evaluated. These concessions typically result from our loss mitigation activities, and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance, or other actions. In general, the Company’s loans that have been subject to classification as TDRs are the result of guidance under ASU No. 2011-02, which indicates that the Company may not consider the borrower’s effective borrowing rate on the old debt immediately before the restructuring in determining whether a concession has been granted. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and typically are returned to performing status after considering the borrower’s sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period of at least six months. During the three- month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were
no
loan modifications that were classified as TDRs.
During the six- month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, certain loans modified were classified as TDRs. They are shown, segregated by class, in the tables below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ For the six-month periods ended ​ ​ December 31, 2022 ​ December 31, 2021 ​ ​ Number of ​ Recorded ​ Number of ​ Recorded (dollars in thousands)      modifications      Investment      modifications      Investment Residential real estate

The Company elected certain relief options under ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), including the option not to recognize right of use asset and lease liabilities that arise from short-term leases (leases with terms of twelve months or less). The Company has
seven
leased properties, which includes banking facilities, administrative offices and ground leases, and numerous office equipment lease agreements in which it is the lessee, with lease terms exceeding twelve months. All of the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases. These operating leases are now included as a ROU asset in the premises and equipment line item on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The corresponding lease liability is included in the accounts payable and other liabilities line item on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
In the February 2022 acquisition of Fortune, the Company assumed a ground lease with an entity that is controlled by a Company insider. This property is in St. Louis County, MO and is in its fourth year of a twenty year term.
ASU 2016-02 also requires certain other accounting elections. The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify, meaning those with terms under twelve months. ROU assets or lease liabilities are not to be recognized for short-term leases. The calculated amount of the ROU assets and lease liabilities in the table below are impacted by the length of the lease term and the discount rate used to present value the minimum lease
-29-
Table of Contents payments. The Company’s lease agreements often include one or more options to renew at the Company’s discretion. If at lease inception, the Company considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. Regarding the discount rate, the ASU requires the use of the rate implicit in the lease whenever this rate is readily determinable. As this rate is rarely determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception over a similar term. The discount rate utilized was
5 %. The expected lease terms range from
18 months
to
20 years . ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      December 31, 2022      June 30, 2022 Consolidated Balance Sheet   ​      ​    Operating leases ROU asset ​ $

Table of Contents Tax credit benefits are recognized under the deferral method of accounting for investments in tax credits. ​ Note 9:   401(k) Retirement Plan The Bank has a 401(k) retirement plan that covers substantially all eligible employees.
The Bank made “safe harbor” matching contributions to the Plan of up to
4 % of eligible compensation, depending upon the percentage of eligible pay deferred into the plan by the employee, and also made additional, discretionary profit-sharing contributions for fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2023, the Company has maintained the safe harbor matching contribution of up to
4 % , and expects to continue to make additional, discretionary profit-sharing contributions.
During the three- and six- month periods ended December 31, 2022 retirement plan expenses recognized for the Plan totaled approximately
$ 523,000
and $ 1.1
million, as compared to $ 428,000
and $ 918,000
for the same period of the prior fiscal year.
Employee deferrals and safe harbor contributions are fully vested.
Profit-sharing or other contributions vest over a period of
five years . Note 10:   Subordinated Debt In March 2004, the Company established Southern Missouri Statutory Trust I as a statutory business trust, to issue Floating Rate Capital Securities (the “Trust Preferred Securities”). The securities mature in 2034, became redeemable after
five years , and bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR. The securities represent undivided beneficial interests in the trust, which was established by the Company for the purpose of issuing the securities. The Trust Preferred Securities were sold in a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) and have not been registered under the Act.
The securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. Southern Missouri Statutory Trust I used the proceeds from the sale of the Trust Preferred Securities to purchase Junior Subordinated Debentures (the “Debentures”) of the Company which have terms identical to the Trust Preferred Securities. At December 31, 2022, the current rate was
7.49 %. The carrying value of the Debentures outstanding was $ 7.2
million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Debentures for working capital and investment in its subsidiaries.
In connection with its October 2013 acquisition of Ozarks Legacy Community Financial, Inc. (OLCF), the Company assumed $ 3.1
million in floating rate junior subordinated debt securities. The debt securities had been issued in June 2005 by OLCF in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities, bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR, are now redeemable at par, and mature in 2035. At December 31, 2022, the current rate was
7.22 %. The carrying value of the debt securities was approximately $ 2.7
million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. In connection with its August 2014 acquisition of Peoples Service Company, Inc. (PSC), the Company assumed $ 6.5
million in floating rate junior subordinated debt securities. The debt securities had been issued in 2005 by PSC’s subsidiary bank holding company, Peoples Banking Company, in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities, bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR, are now redeemable at par, and mature in 2035. At December 31, 2022, the current rate was
6.57 % .
The carrying value of the debt securities was approximately
$ 5.4
million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company’s investment at a face amount of $ 505,000
in the three trusts noted above is included with Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets in the consolidated balance sheets, and is carried at a value of $ 463,000
and $ 461,000
at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. ​ In connection with its February 2022 acquisition of Fortune, the Company assumed $ 7.5
million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes. The notes had been issued in May 2021 by Fortune to a multi-lender group, bear interest through May 2026 at a fixed rate of
4.5 %, and will bear interest thereafter at SOFR plus
3.77 %. The notes will be redeemable at par beginning in May 2026, and mature in May 2031. The carrying value of the notes was approximately $ 7.7
million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. ​ Note 11:   Fair Value Measurements
ASC Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurements , defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Topic 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
-33-
Table of Contents of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1
Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2
Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in active markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities Level
3
Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities Recurring Measurements.
The following table presents the fair value measurements recognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value Measurements at  December 31, 2022 , Using: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Quoted Prices in ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Active Markets for ​ Significant Other ​ Significant ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Identical Assets ​ Observable Inputs ​ Unobservable Inputs (dollars in thousands)      Fair Value      (Level 1)      (Level 2)      (Level 3) Obligations of state and political subdivisions ​ $

Available-for-sale Securities.
When quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing models, or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond’s terms and conditions, among other things.  In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. Nonrecurring Measurements.
There were no assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis within the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy.

( 285 ) ​ ​ The following is a description of valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. For assets classified within Level 3 of fair value hierarchy, the process used to develop the reported fair value process is described below. Foreclosed and Repossessed Assets Held for Sale.
Foreclosed and repossessed assets held for sale are valued at the time the loan is foreclosed upon or collateral is repossessed and the asset is transferred to foreclosed or repossessed assets held for sale. The value of the asset is based on third party or internal appraisals, less estimated costs to sell and appropriate discounts, if any. The appraisals are generally discounted based on current and expected market conditions that may impact the sale or value of the asset and management’s knowledge and experience with similar assets. Such discounts typically may be significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value of these assets. Foreclosed and repossessed assets held for sale are continually evaluated for additional impairment and are adjusted accordingly if impairment is identified. Unobservable (Level 3) Inputs.
There were no Level 3 fair value measurements at December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022. ​ Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

Business Combinations
​ As noted in a current report on Form 8-K filed January 20, 2023, the Company announced the completion of the merger with Citizens Bancshares, Co., Kansas City, Missouri (“Citizens”), the former parent company of Citizens Bank and Trust Company, which has become a subsidiary of Southern Missouri effective with the closing of the merger.
In late February 2023, the Company is planning to merge Citizens Bank and Trust Company with and into Southern Bank, coincident to the scheduled data systems conversion.
At December 31, 2022, Citizens reported total consolidated assets of
$ 973
million, including loans, net, of
$ 463
million, and deposits of
$ 838
million. On a pro forma basis, the combined entity will hold assets of approximately
$ 4.4
billion, including loans, net, of
$ 3.4
billion, and deposits of
$ 3.8
billion.
For the three- and six- month periods ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred $ 605,000
and $ 730,000 , respectively, of third-party acquisition-related costs, included in noninterest expense in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of income.
​ On February 25, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of Fortune, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Fortune Bank (“FB”), in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately
$ 35.5
million.  The acquired financial institution was merged with and into Southern Bank simultaneously with the acquisition of Fortune. For the three- and six- month periods ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred $ 3,000
and $ 47,000 , respectively, compared to $ 181,000
and $ 206,000
in the same periods of the prior fiscal year, of third-party acquisition-related costs, included in
noninterest expense
in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of income. ​ Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition.
Based on valuations of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the purchase price for the Fortune acquisition is detailed in the following table. ​ -36-

Goodwill is attributable to synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Bank and Fortune.
To the extent that management revises any of the fair value of the above fair value adjustments as a result of continuing evaluation, the amount of goodwill recorded in the acquisition will change. ​ The Company acquired the $ 204.1
million loan portfolio at an estimated fair value discount of $ 2.1
million. The excess of expected cash flows above the fair value of the performing portion of loans will be accreted to interest income over the remaining lives of the loans in accordance with ASC 310-30.
Loans acquired that were not subject to guidance relating to PCD loans include loans with a fair value and gross contractual amounts receivable of
$ 187.0
million and $ 211.0
million at the date of acquisition.
Management identified
31
PCD loans, with a book balance of $ 15.1
million, associated with the Fortune acquisition (ASC 310-30). ​ On December 15, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of the Cairo, Illinois, branch of First National Bank, Oldham, South Dakota. The deal resulted in Southern Bank relocating its facility from its prior location to the First National Bank location in Cairo. The Company views the acquisition and updates to the new facility as an expression of its continuing commitment to the Cairo community.
For the three- and six- month periods ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred
no
third-party acquisition-related costs, compared to $ 24,000
in the same periods of the prior fiscal year.

Item 2 :  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations SOUTHERN MISSOURI BANCORP, INC. General Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc. (Southern Missouri or Company) is a Missouri corporation and owns all of the outstanding stock of Southern Bank (the Bank). The Company’s earnings are primarily dependent on the operations of the Bank. As a result, the following discussion relates primarily to the operations of the Bank. The Bank’s deposit accounts are generally insured up to a maximum of $250,000 by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). At December 31, 2022, the Bank operated from its headquarters, 48 full-service branch offices, and two limited-service branch offices. The Bank owns the office building and related land in which its headquarters are located, and 45 of its other branch offices. The remaining five branches are either leased or partially owned. ​ The significant accounting policies followed by Southern Missouri and its wholly owned subsidiaries for interim financial reporting are consistent with the accounting policies followed for annual financial reporting. All adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature and are in the opinion of management necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported, have been included in the accompanying condensed consolidated condensed financial statements. ​ The condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2022, has been derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of that date. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the Company’s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ​ Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The following discussion reviews the Company’s condensed consolidated financial condition at December 31, 2022, and results of operations for the three-and six- month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. ​ Forward Looking Statements This document contains statements about the Company and its subsidiaries which we believe are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements with respect to anticipated future operating and financial performance, growth opportunities, interest rates, cost savings and funding advantages expected or anticipated to be realized by management. Words such as “may,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan” and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements by the Company and its management are based on beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations, estimates and intentions of management and are not guarantees of future performance. The important factors we discuss below, as well as other factors discussed under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and identified in this filing and in our other filings with the SEC and those presented elsewhere by our management from time to time, could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this document: ● potential adverse impacts to the economic conditions in the Company’s local market areas, other markets where the Company has lending relationships, or other aspects of the Company’s business operations or financial markets, generally, resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and any governmental or societal responses thereto; -39-
Table of Contents ● expected cost savings, synergies and other benefits from our merger and acquisition activities, including our ongoing and recently completed acquisitions, might not be realized within the anticipated time frames, to the extent anticipated, or at all, and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention and labor shortages, might be greater than expected; ● the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operations, including unemployment levels and labor shortages; ● fluctuations in interest rates and inflation, including the effects of a potential recession or slowed economic growth caused by changes in oil prices or supply chain disruptions; ● monetary and fiscal policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) and the U.S. Government and other governmental initiatives affecting the financial services industry; ● the risks of lending and investing activities, including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; ● our ability to access cost-effective funding; ● the timely development of and acceptance of our new products and services and the perceived overall value of these products and services by users, including the features, pricing and quality compared to competitors’ products and services; ● fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate markets, as well as agricultural business conditions; ● demand for loans and deposits in our market area; ● legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect our business; ● changes in accounting principles, policies, or guidelines; ● results of examinations of us by our regulators, including the possibility that our regulators may, among other things, require us to increase our reserve for loan losses or to write-down assets; ● the impact of technological changes; and ● our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing. The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information, or otherwise. Critical Accounting Policies Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America are complex and require management to apply significant judgments to various accounting, reporting and disclosure matters. Management of the Company must use assumptions and estimates to apply these principles where actual measurement is not possible or practical. For a complete discussion of the Company’s significant accounting policies, see “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-k. Certain policies are considered critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments, assumptions and estimates. Changes in such estimates may have a significant impact on the financial statements. Management has reviewed the application of these policies with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. For a discussion of applying critical accounting policies, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” beginning on page 62 in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report.

Table of Contents COVID-19 Pandemic Response
During the global pandemic that took center stage during the past two years, the Company continued to serve our communities and our customers. The Company continues to actively monitor and respond to any remaining effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. General operating conditions . From the initial onset of the pandemic in March, 2020, the Company worked to increase our telework capabilities, and we had as many as 10-15% of our team members working remotely during the height of the pandemic either on a regular or rotating basis. The Company chose not to extend beyond March 31, 2021, the additional leave provisions (over and above the Company’s standard paid time off policy) provided for under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (the FFCRA) or the CARES Act. The operations of the Company’s internal controls have not been significantly impacted by changes in our work environment. SBA Paycheck Protection Program Lending .
In the first and second rounds of funding made available through the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), the Company originated just over 3,200 loans totaling $197.2 million through the program’s expiration on May 31, 2021. The Company has made substantial progress in processing and receiving approval from the SBA for applications by borrowers for forgiveness, and as of December 31, 2022, total PPP loans outstanding were reduced to $888,000.
Deferrals and modifications .
In the months following the onset of the pandemic, the Company adhered to regulatory guidance encouraging financial institutions to work with borrowers affected by the pandemic to defer or temporarily modify payment arrangements. Under the CARES Act and subsequent legislation, in instances where the borrower was otherwise current and performing prior to the pandemic, the Company was permitted the option of temporarily suspending certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings (TDRs).
As of June 30, 2020, the Company had provided such relief for approximately 900 loans totaling $380.2 million. As of June 30, 2021, the number of such modifications was reduced to six loans with balances totaling $23.9 million.
At its January 1, 2022 expiration, the CARES Act was not further extended; therefore, the provisions to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP as related to TDRs were no longer available.
For more information regarding these deferrals and modifications, see discussion included in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (specifically: Financial Condition, Allowance for Credit Losses).
Executive Summary
Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest margin, which is directly impacted by the interest rate environment. The net interest margin represents interest income earned on interest-earning assets (primarily real estate loans, commercial and agricultural loans, and the investment portfolio), less interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities (primarily interest-bearing transaction accounts, certificates of deposit, savings and money market deposit accounts, and borrowed funds), as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Net interest margin is directly impacted by the spread between long-term interest rates and short-term interest rates, as our interest-earning assets, particularly those with initial terms to maturity or repricing greater than one year, generally price off longer term rates while our interest-bearing liabilities generally price off shorter term interest rates. This difference in longer term and shorter term interest rates is often referred to as the steepness of the yield curve. A steep yield curve – in which the difference in interest rates between short term and long term periods is relatively large – could be beneficial to our net interest income, as the interest rate spread between our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities would be larger. Conversely, a flat or flattening yield curve, in which the difference in rates between short term and long term periods is relatively small or shrinking, or an inverted yield curve, in which short term rates exceed long term rates, could have an adverse impact on our net interest income, as our interest rate spread could decrease. ​ Our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. ​ During the first six months of fiscal 2023, total assets increased by $235.8 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in loans, net of the allowance for credit losses (ACL), partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents and time deposits decreased by a combined $36.4 million; AFS securities decreased
-41-
Table of Contents $4.0 million; and loans, net of the ACL, increased $271.3 million. Liabilities increased $219.6 million, as deposits increased $190.7 million and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) increased $23.5 million. Equity increased $16.2 million, attributable primarily to earnings retained after cash dividends paid, partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss as the market value of the Company’s investments declined due to increases in market interest rates. ​ Net income for the first six months of fiscal 2023 was $21.3 million, a decrease of $3.5 million, or 14.0% as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Compared to the year-ago period, the Company’s decrease in net income was attributable to increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense, partially offset by increases in net interest income and noninterest income, and a decrease in provision for income taxes. Diluted net income was $2.30 per common share for the first six months of fiscal 2023, as compared to $2.78 per common share for the same period of the prior fiscal year. For the first six months of fiscal 2023, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, net interest income increased $6.1 million or 12.0%; provision for credit losses (“PCL”) swung from a recovery of $305,000 to a charge of $6.2 million; noninterest income increased $1.2 million, or 11.9%; noninterest expense increased $5.3 million, or 18.0%; and provision for income tax decreased $1.0 million, or 15.7%. For more information see “Results of Operations.” ​ Interest rates during the first six months of fiscal 2023 remained volatile and moved higher, while the yield curve further inverted, with shorter-term obligations yielding more than longer-term obligations. While the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee (FOMC) has raised short-term rates significantly since March 2022, market expectations for economic growth over the next several years have become less optimistic. At December 31, 2022, as compared to June 30, 2022, the yield on two-year treasuries increased from 2.92% to 4.41%; the yield on five-year treasuries increased from 3.01% to 3.99%; the yield on ten-year treasuries increased from 2.98% to 3.88%; and the yield on 30-year treasuries increased from 3.14% to 3.97%.
​ As compared to the first six months of the prior fiscal year, our average yield on earning assets increased by 25 basis points, primarily attributable to increases in loans receivable, available for sale securities, and cash and cash equivalents from year-ago levels. Our cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 71 basis points, as the Company increased offering rates on nonmaturity accounts and maturing time deposits to maintain funding in a more competitive environment. Brokered CD funding was utilized to reduce the Company’s overnight borrowing position resulting from loan growth outpacing deposit growth.
Higher market rates reflected the policy of the FOMC, which has increased overnight funding rates and began a “quantitative tightening” program to reverse some of the excess reserves placed into the financial system since March 2020. (See “Results of Operations: Comparison of the six-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 – Net Interest Income”.) The rapid increase in the level of short-term market interest rates, along with the yield curve inversion is concerning, as our cost of funds is likely to increase at a faster pace than our asset yields over the near term. ​ As PPP loan forgiveness declined, the Company’s accretion of interest income from deferred origination fees on these loans was reduced to $72,000 for the first six months of the fiscal year, which impacted net interest margin by less than one basis point, compared to $3.1 million in the same period a year ago, which impacted net interest margin by 20 basis points. ​ The Company’s net income is also affected by the level of its noninterest income and noninterest expenses. Noninterest income generally consists primarily of deposit account service charges, bank card interchange income, loan-related fees, earnings on bank-owned life insurance, gains on sales of loans, and other general operating income. Noninterest expenses consist primarily of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy-related expenses, deposit insurance assessments, professional fees, advertising, postage and office expenses, insurance, the amortization of intangible assets, and other general operating expenses.
​ The Company’s noninterest income for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $11.0 million, an increase $1.2 million, or 11.9%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. In the current period, increases in other loan fees, loan serving fees, deposit account service charges, and bank card interchange income, were partially offset by a decrease in gains realized on the sale of residential real estate loans originated for that purpose. Origination of residential real estate loans for sale on the secondary market was down 61.8% as compared to the year ago period, as
-42-
Table of Contents both refinancing and purchase activity declined due to the increase in market interest rates, resulting in a decrease to both gains on sale of these loans and recognition of new mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by income from the servicing and gain on sale of the guaranty portion of government-guaranteed loans.
​ Noninterest expense for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $34.6 million, an increase of $5.3 million, or 18.0%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was attributable primarily to compensation and benefits, legal and professional, occupancy expenses, data processing expenses, amortization of core deposit intangibles, deposit insurance premiums, and other noninterest expenses, and was partially offset by a reduction in foreclosed property expenses and losses. Charges related to merger and acquisition activities totaled $777,000 in the current fiscal year, reflected in data processing, and legal and professional fees.
In the year ago period, similar charges totaled $230,000.
​ We expect, over time, to continue to grow our assets through the origination and occasional purchase of loans, and purchases of investment securities. The primary funding for this asset growth is expected to come from retail deposits, brokered funding, and short- and long-term FHLB borrowings. We have grown and intend to continue to grow deposits by offering desirable deposit products for our current customers and by attracting new depository relationships. We will also continue to explore strategic expansion opportunities in market areas that we believe will be attractive to our business model. ​ ​ Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31 and June 30, 2022 The Company experienced balance sheet growth in the first six months of fiscal 2023, with total assets of $3.5 billion at December 31, 2022, reflecting an increase of $235.8 million, or 7.3%, as compared to June 30, 2022. Growth primarily reflected an increase in net loans receivable, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. ​ Cash equivalents and time deposits were a combined $55.1 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $36.4 million, or 39.8%, as compared to June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily a result of loan growth outpacing deposit growth during the period. AFS securities were $231.4 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $4.0 million, or 1.7%, as compared to June 30, 2022. ​ Loans, net of the ACL, were $3.0 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $271.3 million, or 10.1%, as compared to June 30, 2022. Gross loans increased by $275.6 million, while the ACL attributable to outstanding loan balances increased $4.3 million as compared to June 30, 2022. The increase in loan balances was attributable to growth in residential and commercial real estate loans, drawn construction loan balances, commercial loans, and a modest contribution from consumer loans. Residential real estate loan balances increased primarily due to growth in multi-family loans. Commercial real estate balances increased primarily from an increase in loans secured by nonresidential structures, along with modest growth in loans secured by farmland. Construction loan balances increased due primarily to draws on nonowner-occupied nonresidential real estate and multifamily residential real estate construction loans. The increase in commercial loans was attributable to agricultural and commercial and industrial loans.
Total remaining PPP balances at December 31, 2022, were $888,000, while unrecognized deferred fee income on these loans was immaterial.
​ Loans anticipated to fund in the next 90 days totaled $121.6 million at December 31, 2022, as compared to $235.0 million at June 30, 2022, and $158.2 million at December 30, 2021. ​ Deposits were $3.0 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $190.7 million, or 6.8%, as compared to June 30, 2022. The deposit portfolio saw fiscal year-to-date increases in certificates of deposit, money market deposit accounts, and noninterest bearing transaction accounts, partially offset by decreases in savings accounts. CD growth was attributable in large part to the use of brokered CDs to fund asset growth, accounting for $89.3 million of the total $139.9 million growth in CD balances. Public unit balances totaled $521.2 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $47.9 million compared to $473.3 million at June 30, 2022, and a $103.4 million increase as compared to $417.8 million at December 31, 2021. The average loan-to-deposit ratio for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was 103.1%, as compared to 93.6% for the same period of the prior fiscal year.
​ -43-
Table of Contents FHLB advances were $61.5 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $23.5 million, or 62.0%, as compared to June 30, 2022, as the Company’s loan growth outpaced deposit growth. The increase in FHLB advances was inclusive of $28.5 million in overnight borrowings, reflecting recent loan demand, and was down from $190.0 million borrowed overnight at September 30, 2022, as the Company utilized brokered CD funding in the current quarter to reduce its overnight position. ​ The Company’s stockholders’ equity was $337.0 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $16.2 million, or 5.1%, as compared to June 30, 2022. The increase was attributable primarily to earnings retained after cash dividends paid, partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss as the market value of the Company’s investments declined due to increases in market interest rates. ​ -44-

Table of Contents Results of Operations – Comparison of the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
General .
Net income for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $11.7 million, a decrease of $321,000, or 2.7%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was attributable to increases in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses, partially offset by increases in net interest income and noninterest income, and a decrease in provision for income taxes. ​ For the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, basic and fully-diluted net income per share available to common shareholders was $1.26 under both measures, as compared to $1.35 under both measures for the same period of the prior fiscal year, which represented decreases of $0.09, or 6.7% under both measures. Our annualized return on average assets for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, was 1.35%, as compared to 1.69% for the same period of the prior fiscal year. Our return on average common stockholders’ equity for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, was 14.2%, as compared to 16.1% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. ​ Net Interest Income . Net interest income for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $28.3 million, an increase of $3.2 million, or 12.7%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was attributable to a 23.2% increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in net interest margin to 3.45% in the current three-month period, from 3.77% in the same period a year ago. As PPP loan forgiveness declined, the Company’s accretion of interest income from deferred origination fees on these loans was reduced to $35,000 in the current quarter, which impacted net interest margin by less than one basis point, as compared to $890,000 in the same quarter a year ago, which added 13 basis points to the net interest margin in that period. Future accretion of deferred origination fees on PPP loans will be immaterial. ​ Loan discount accretion and deposit premium amortization related to the Company’s August 2014 acquisition of Peoples Bank of the Ozarks, the June 2017 acquisition of Capaha Bank, the February 2018 acquisition of Southern Missouri Bank of Marshfield, the November 2018 acquisition of First Commercial Bank, the May 2020 acquisition of Central Federal Savings & Loan Association, and the February 2022 merger of Fortune with the Company resulted in $493,000 in net interest income for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $381,000 in net interest income for the same period a year ago. Combined, this component of net interest income contributed six basis points to net interest margin in the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, unchanged from the same period of the prior fiscal year. ​ For the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 our net interest rate spread was 3.16%, as compared to 3.66% in the year-ago period. The decrease in net interest rate spread, compared to the same period a year ago, resulted from a 101 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, offset with a 52 basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. ​ Interest Income.
Total interest income for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $38.9 million, an increase of $10.8 million, or 38.3%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was attributed to a 23.2% increase in the average balance of assets, and a 52 basis point increase in the average yield earned on interest-earning assets, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Increased average interest-earning balances were attributable primarily to growth in the loan portfolio, and mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by decreases in other interest-earning assets, including cash and cash equivalents. The increase in interest-earning asset yield was attributable primarily to an increase in market interest rates.
​ Interest Expense.
Total interest expense for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $10.6 million, an increase of $7.6 million, or 248.9%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was attributable to a 101 basis point
increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, combined with a 25.8% increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was attributable primarily to the increased rates paid on certificates of deposit, nonmaturity deposit accounts, and FHLB advances, while the increased average balance was attributable to growth in interest-bearing nonmaturity deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, and FHLB advances, used primarily to fund loan growth. ​ -48-
Table of Contents Provision for Credit Losses.
The PCL for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, was a charge of $1.1 million, as compared to no PCL in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increased level of provisioning was driven mostly by a modest decline in the modeled economic outlook as compared to the assessment as of June 30, 2022, along with the increase in construction and other lines of credit available, which resulted in a $773,000 increase in the required ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposure, combined with a
$365,000 increase in required ACL for outstanding loan balances. Projections for GDP growth and unemployment, key drivers in the Company’s ACL model, have weakened. As a percentage of average loans outstanding, the Company recorded net charge offs of four basis points during the current period, compared to less than one basis point (annualized) during the same period of the prior fiscal year. (See “Critical Accounting Policies”, “Allowance for Credit Loss Activity” and “Nonperforming Assets”). ​ Noninterest Income.
Noninterest income for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $5.5 million, an increase of $171,000, or 3.2%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. In the current period, increases in other loan fees, bank card interchange income, deposit account service charges, loan servicing fees, and other income were partially offset by a decrease in gains realized on the sale of residential real estate loans originated for that purpose. The increase in other income was attributable to a gain on the sale of fixed assets of $317,000 as the Company sold previously acquired properties not currently being utilized as banking facilities. This increase was partially offset by the inclusion in the year ago period of a non-recurring benefit of $278,000 recognized on the Company’s exit from a renewable energy tax credit partnership. Origination of residential real estate loans for sale on the secondary market was down 73.7% as compared to the year ago period, as both refinancing and purchase activity declined due to the increase in market interest rates, resulting in a decrease to both gains on sale of these loans and recognition of new mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by income from the servicing and gain on sale of the guaranty portion of government-guaranteed loans.
​ Noninterest Expense.
Noninterest expense for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $17.6 million, an increase of $2.6 million, or 17.0%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was attributable primarily to compensation and benefits, legal and professional fees, occupancy expenses, data processing expenses, deposit insurance premiums, and other noninterest expenses, and were partially offset by decreases in foreclosed property expenses and advertising. Charges related to merger and acquisition activities totaled $608,000 in the current period, reflected primarily in legal and professional fees, and, to a lesser extent, data processing fees.
In the year ago period, similar charges totaled $205,000. The increase in compensation and benefits as compared to the prior year period primarily reflected increases in salaries and wages over the prior year, increased headcount resulting from the Fortune merger, and a trend increase in legacy employee headcount. Occupancy expenses increased primarily due to facilities added through the Fortune merger, and other equipment purchases. Other noninterest expenses increased due to miscellaneous merger-related expenses, expenses related to loan originations, deposit operations, and employee travel and training. ​ Income Taxes.
The income tax provision for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $3.3 million, a decrease of $21,000, or 0.6% as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year due to the decrease of pre-tax income, and partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate to 21.9% as compared to 21.5% in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year.
​ ​ Results of Operations – Comparison of the six-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
General.
Net income for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $21.3 million, a decrease of $3.5 million, or 14.0%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was attributable to increases in PCL and noninterest expense, partially offset by increases in net interest income and noninterest income, and a decrease in provision for income taxes. ​ For the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, basic and fully-diluted net income per share available to common shareholders was $2.30 under both measures, as compared to $2.78 under both measures for the same period of the prior fiscal year, which represented decreases of $0.48, or 17.3% under both measures. Our annualized return on average assets for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, was 1.26%, as compared to 1.78% for the same period of the
-49-
Table of Contents prior fiscal year. Our return on average common stockholders’ equity for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, was 13.0%, as compared to 16.9% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. ​ Net Interest Income.
Net interest income for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $56.8 million, an increase of $6.1 million, or 12.0%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was attributable to a 22.7% increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin to 3.55%, as compared to 3.89% in the same period a year ago. As PPP loan forgiveness declined, the Company’s accretion of interest income from deferred origination fees on these loans was reduced to $72,000 in the six-month period, which impacted net interest margin by less than one basis point, as compared to $3.1 million in the same period a year ago, which added 23 basis points to the net interest margin in that period. Future accretion of deferred origination fees on PPP loans will be immaterial. ​ Loan discount accretion and deposit premium amortization related to the Company’s August 2014 acquisition of Peoples Bank of the Ozarks, the June 2017 acquisition of Capaha Bank, the February 2018 acquisition of Southern Missouri Bank of Marshfield, the November 2018 acquisition of First Commercial Bank, the May 2020 acquisition of Central Federal Savings & Loan Association, and the February 2022 merger of Fortune with the Company resulted in $1.0 million in net interest income for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $757,000 in net interest income for the same period a year ago. Combined, this component of net interest income contributed six basis points to net interest margin in the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, as compared to a six basis point contribution for the same period of the prior fiscal year.
​ For the six-month period ended December 31, 2022 our net interest rate spread was 3.31%, as compared to 3.77% in the year-ago period. The decrease in net interest rate spread, compared to the same period a year ago, resulted from a 71 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, offset by a 25 basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. ​ Interest Income.
Total interest income for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $73.8 million, an increase of $16.9 million, or 29.7%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was attributed to a 22.7% increase in the average balance of assets,
combined with an increase of
25 basis points in the average yield earned on interest-earning assets, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Increased average interest-earning balances were attributable primarily to growth in the loan portfolio and mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by decreases in other interest-earning assets, including cash and cash equivalents. The increase in interest-earning asset yield was attributable primarily to increased market interest rates and a shift in the composition of the Company’s interest-earning asset balances to include a lower proportion of cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by the reduced impact of accretion of deferred origination fees on PPP loans.
​ Interest Expense.
Total interest expense for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $17.1 million, an increase of $10.8 million, or 173.0%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was attributable to a 71 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, combined with a 24.7% increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was attributable primarily to the increased rates paid on certificates of deposit, nonmaturity deposit accounts, and FHLB advances, while the increased average balance was attributable to growth in interest-bearing nonmaturity accounts, certificates of deposit, and FHLB advances used primarily to fund loan growth. ​ Provision for Credit Losses.
The PCL for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, was a charge of $6.2 million, as compared to a $305,000 recovery in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increased level of provisioning was driven mostly by loan growth in the fiscal year-to-date, as well as a modest decline in the modeled economic outlook, which resulted in a $4.3 million increase in the required ACL on outstanding loan balances, combined with an increase of $1.6 million in the required ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposure. Projections for GDP growth and unemployment, key drivers in the Company’s ACL model, have modestly deteriorated. As a percentage of average loans outstanding, the Company recorded net charge offs of two basis points (annualized) during the current period, compared to less than one basis point during the same period of the prior fiscal year. (See “Critical Accounting Policies”, “Allowance for Credit Loss Activity” and “Nonperforming Assets”). ​ -50-
Table of Contents Noninterest Income.
Noninterest income for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $11.0 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 11.9%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. In the current period, increases in other loan fees, deposit account service charges, loan servicing fees, bank card interchange income, and other income were partially offset by a decrease in gains realized on the sale of residential real estate loans originated for that purpose. The increase in other income was attributable to a gain on the sale of fixed assets of $317,000 as the Company sold previously acquired properties not currently being utilized as banking facilities. This increase was partially offset by the inclusion in the year ago period of a non-recurring benefit of $278,000 recognized on the Company’s exit from a renewable energy tax credit partnership. Origination of residential real estate loans for sale on the secondary market was down 61.8% as compared to the year ago period, as both refinancing and purchase activity declined due to the increase in market interest rates, resulting in a decrease to both gains on sale of these loans and recognition of new mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by income from the servicing and gain on sale of the guaranty portion of government-guaranteed loans.
​ Noninterest Expense.
Noninterest expense for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $34.6 million, an increase of $5.3 million, or 18.0%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was attributable primarily to compensation and benefits, legal and professional fees, occupancy expenses, data processing expenses, amortization of core deposit intangibles, deposit insurance premiums, and other noninterest expenses, and were partially offset by decreases in foreclosed property expenses. Charges related to merger and acquisition activities totaled $777,000 in the current period, reflected primarily in legal and professional fees, and, to a lesser extent, data processing fees.
In the year ago period, similar charges totaled $230,000. The increase in compensation and benefits as compared to the prior year period primarily reflected increases in salaries and wages over the prior year, increased headcount resulting from the Fortune merger, and a trend increase in legacy employee headcount. Occupancy expenses increased primarily due to facilities added through the Fortune merger, and other equipment purchases. Other noninterest expenses increased due to increases in miscellaneous merger-related expenses, expenses related to loan originations, employee travel and training, deposit operations, and sales and use tax, partially offset by a decrease in deposit products expense. ​ Income Taxes.
The income tax provision for the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, was $5.7 million, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 15.7%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, due primarily to reduced pre-tax income. The effective tax rate declined to 21.2% as compared to 21.5% in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. ​ ​ -51-
Table of Contents Allowance for Credit Loss Activity The Company regularly reviews its ACL and makes adjustments to its balance based on management’s estimate of (1) the total expected losses included in the Company’s financial assets held at amortized cost, which is limited to the Company’s loan portfolio, and (2) any credit deterioration in the Company’s available-for-sale securities as of the balance sheet date. The Company holds no securities classified as held-to-maturity. ​ Although the Company maintains its ACL at a level that it considers sufficient to provide for losses, there can be no assurance that future losses will not exceed internal estimates. In addition, the amount of the ACL is subject to review by regulatory agencies, which can order the Company to record additional allowances. The required ACL has been estimated based upon the guidelines in ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. ​ The estimate involves consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the loans as segmented by the Company, and is based on an evaluation, at the reporting date, of historical loss experience, coupled with qualitative adjustments to address current economic conditions and credit quality, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Specific qualitative factors considered include, but may not be limited to: ​ • Changes in lending policies and/or loan review system • National, regional, and local economic trends and/or conditions • Changes and/or trends in the nature, volume, or terms of the loan portfolio • Experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff • Levels and/or trends of delinquent, non-accrual, problem assets, or charge offs and recoveries • Concentrations of credit • Changes in collateral values • Agricultural economic conditions • Risks from regulatory, legal, or competitive factors ​ The following table summarizes changes in the ACL over the three- and six- month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

32,529 ​ Our ACL at December 31, 2022, totaled $37.5 million, representing 1.25% of gross loans and 783% of nonperforming loans, as compared to an ACL of $33.2 million, representing 1.22% of gross loans and 806% of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2022. The increase in our ACL relative to gross loans was attributable primarily to a modest deterioration in the economic outlook modeled in our ACL methodology. For the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, the ACL was increased by $4.3 million and the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures was increased by $1.6 million, reflecting a PCL of $6.2 million and net charge offs of $324,000. -52-
Table of Contents ​ The PCL was based on the estimated required ACL, reflecting management’s estimate of the current expected credit losses in the Company’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2022, and management believes the ACL as of that date is adequate based on that estimate. There remains, however, significant uncertainty as economic activity recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Federal Reserve withdraws accommodative monetary policy that was put into effect to respond to the pandemic and its economic impact. Management continues to consider the potential impact of the lengthy pandemic on borrowers most affected by mitigation efforts, most notably including our borrowers in the hotel industry.
​ For the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, the ACL increased by $65,000 and the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures increased by $773,000, reflecting a PCL of $1.1 million, and net charge offs of $300,000.
At December 31, 2022, the Bank also had accrued within other liabilities an allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures of $4.9 million, as compared to $3.3 million at June 30, 2022. The increase reflects the component of the PCL attributable to off-balance sheet credit exposures noted above. This amount is maintained as a separate liability account to cover estimated credit losses associated with off-balance sheet credit instruments such as off-balance sheet loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and guarantees. The $1.6 million increase in the estimated allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures was primarily the result of an increase in the amount of unfunded commitments (unused lines of credit) available and expected to be utilized. The following table sets forth the sum of the amounts of the ACL attributable to individual loans within each category, or the loan categories in general, and the percentage of the ACL that is attributable to each category, as of the reporting date. The table also reflects the percentage of loans in each category to the total loan portfolio, as of the reporting date.

100.0 % ​ ​ For loans that do not exhibit similar risk characteristics, the Company evaluates the loan on an individual basis. Loans that are classified with an adverse internal credit rating or identified as TDRs are most commonly considered for individual evaluation. The ACL for individually evaluated loans may be estimated based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, or based on the present value of expected cash flows. ​ At December 31, 2022, the Company had loans of $37.6 million, or 1.25% of total loans, adversely classified ($37.6 million classified “substandard”; none classified “doubtful”), as compared to loans of $27.1 million, or 1.00% of total loans, adversely classified ($26.3 million classified “substandard”; $827,000 classified “doubtful”) at June 30, 2022, and $15.3 million, or 0.64% of total
loans, adversely classified ($14.5 million classified “substandard”; $827,000 classified “doubtful”) at December 31, 2021.
The increase as compared to June 30, 2022,
primarily reflected the migration from the special mention category to substandard of one $9.0 million relationship. Classified loans were generally comprised of loans secured by commercial and residential real estate, and other commercial purpose collateral. All loans were classified due to concerns as to the borrowers’ ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to service the debt. Of our classified loans, the Company had ceased recognition of interest on loans with a carrying value of $2.5 million at December 31, 2022. As reported in Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company’s total past due loans increased from $4.6 million at June 30, 2022, to $8.9 million at December 31, 2022. Total past due loans were $3.3 million at December 31, 2021.
The increase in past due loans as compared to June 30, 2022, was primarily attributable to increases in delinquencies in non-owner occupied nonresidential real estate, residential real estate loans and home equity lines of credit.  Of these delinquent loans, 16.6% are classified as non-accrual and appropriate collection efforts are being actively monitored. -53-
Table of Contents Nonperforming Assets The ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets and nonperforming loans to net loans receivable is another measure of asset quality. Nonperforming assets of the Company include nonaccruing loans, accruing loans delinquent/past maturity 90 days or more, and assets which have been acquired as a result of foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. The table below summarizes changes in the Company’s level of nonperforming assets over selected time periods: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​   ​      December 31, 2022      June 30, 2022      December 31, 2021 ​   ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nonaccruing loans:   ​      ​      ​    ​ ​ Residential real estate ​ $

The remaining $30.2 million in TDRs have complied with the modified terms for a reasonable period of time and are therefore considered by the Company to be accrual status loans. In general, these loans were subject to classification as TDRs at December, 31 2022, on the basis of guidance under ASU No. 2011-02, which indicates that the Company may not consider the borrower’s effective borrowing rate on the old debt immediately before the restructuring in determining whether a concession has been granted. At June 30, 2022, TDRs totaled $31.4 million, of which $807,000 was considered nonperforming and included in the nonaccrual loan total above. The remaining $30.6 million in TDRs at June 30, 2022, had complied with the modified terms for a reasonable period of time and were therefore considered by the Company to be accrual status loans. ​ At December 31, 2022, nonperforming assets totaled $6.6 million, as compared to $6.3 million at June 30, 2022, and $4.8 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in nonperforming assets as compared to June 30, 2022, was attributable primarily to the increase in nonperforming loans, partially offset by the sale of one parcel held in other real estate owned.

Table of Contents Liquidity Resources The term “liquidity” refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations, loans purchases, deposit withdrawals and operating expenses. Our primary sources of funds include deposit growth, FHLB advances, brokered deposits, amortization and prepayment of loan principal and interest, investment maturities and sales, and funds provided by our operations. While the scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable, deposit flows, FHLB advance redemptions, and loan and security prepayment rates are significantly influenced by factors outside of the Bank’s control, including interest rates, general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace. The Bank relies on FHLB advances and brokered deposits as additional sources for funding cash or liquidity needs. ​ The Company uses its liquid resources principally to satisfy its ongoing cash requirements, which include funding loan commitments, funding maturing certificates of deposit and deposit withdrawals, maintaining liquidity, funding maturing or called FHLB advances, purchasing investments, and meeting operating expenses. ​ At December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding commitments and approvals to extend credit of approximately $650.4 million (including $528.8 million in unused lines of credit) in mortgage and non-mortgage loans. These commitments and approvals are expected to be funded through existing cash balances, cash flow from normal operations and, if needed, advances from the FHLB or the Federal Reserve’s discount window. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had pledged $856.5 million of its single-family residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios to the FHLB for available credit of approximately $523.4 million, of which $61.7 million was advanced, while an additional $368,000 was encumbered in relation to residential real estate loans sold onto the secondary market through the FHLB, and $10.3 million was utilized as collateral for the issuance of letters of credit to secure public unit deposits. The Bank has the ability to pledge several other loan portfolios, including, for example, its commercial and home equity loans, which could provide additional collateral for additional borrowings. In total, FHLB borrowings are generally limited to 45% of bank assets, or approximately $1.5 billion, subject to available collateral. Also, at December 31, 2022, the Bank had pledged a total of $327.5 million in loans secured by farmland and agricultural production loans to the Federal Reserve, providing access to $262.3 million in primary credit borrowings from the Federal Reserve’s discount window, none of which was advanced at December 31, 2022. Management believes its liquid resources will be sufficient to meet the Company’s liquidity needs.
Regulatory Capital The Company and Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary – actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company and the Bank’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under U.S. GAAP, regulatory reporting requirements and regulatory capital standards. The Company’s and Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Furthermore, the Company’s and Bank’s regulators could require adjustments to regulatory capital not reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ Quantitative measures established by regulatory capital standards to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total capital, Tier 1 capital (as defined), and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average total assets (as defined). Additionally, to make distributions or discretionary bonus payments, the Company and Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. Management believes, as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, that the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. ​ Effective January 1, 2020, depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent, are considered qualifying community banking organizations and are eligible to opt into an alternative, simplified
-55-
Table of Contents regulatory capital framework, which utilizes a newly-defined “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (CBLR). The CBLR framework is an optional framework that is designed to reduce burden by removing the requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios for qualifying community banking organizations that opt into the framework. Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the CBLR framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent are considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the agencies’ generally applicable capital rule. In April 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies announced the issuance of two interim final rules to provide temporary relief to community banking organizations, and adopted the final rule with no changes in October 2020. Under the rules, the CBLR requirement was a minimum of 8.0% for the remainder of calendar year 2020, was 8.5% for calendar year 2021, and 9.0% thereafter. The Company and the Bank have not made an election to utilize the CBLR framework, but will continue to monitor the available option, and could do so in the future. ​ In August 2020, the Federal banking agencies adopted a final rule updating a December 2018 rule regarding the impact on regulatory capital of adoption of the CECL standard. The rule allows institutions that adopted the CECL standard in 2020 a five-year transition period to recognize the estimated impact of adoption on regulatory capital. The Company and the Bank elected to exercise the option to recognize the impact of adoption over the five-year period. ​ As of December 31, 2022, the most recent notification from the Federal banking agencies categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, common equity Tier 1 risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank’s category. ​ ​ -56-

Item 3 :  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk SOUTHERN MISSOURI BANCORP, INC. Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk The goal of the Company’s asset/liability management strategy is to manage the interest rate sensitivity of both interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities in order to maximize net interest income without exposing the Bank to an excessive level of interest rate risk. The Company employs various strategies intended to manage the potential effect that changing interest rates may have on future operating results. The primary asset/liability management strategy has been to focus on matching the anticipated re-pricing intervals of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. At times, however, depending on the level of general interest rates, the relationship between long- and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, the Company may determine to increase its interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain its net interest margin. In an effort to manage the interest rate risk resulting from fixed rate lending, the Bank has utilized longer term FHLB advances (with maturities up to ten years), subject to early redemptions and fixed terms. Other elements of the Company’s current asset/liability strategy include (i) increasing originations of commercial business, commercial real estate, agricultural operating lines, and agricultural real estate loans, which typically provide higher yields and shorter repricing periods, but inherently increase credit risk; (ii) actively soliciting less rate-sensitive deposits, including aggressive use of the Company’s “rewards checking” product, and (iii) offering competitively-priced money market accounts and CDs with maturities of up to five years. The degree to which each segment of the strategy is achieved will affect profitability and exposure to interest rate risk. The Company continues to originate long-term, fixed-rate residential loans. During the first six months of fiscal year 2023, fixed rate 1- to 4-family residential loan production totaled $82.3 million (of which $11.5 million was originated for sale into the secondary market), as compared to $131.5 million during the same period of the prior fiscal year (of which $28.6 million was originated for sale into the secondary market). At December 31, 2022, the fixed rate residential loan portfolio was $520.0 million with a weighted average maturity of 196 months, as compared to $409.7 million at December 31, 2021, with a weighted average maturity of 193 months. The Company originated $16.1 million in adjustable-rate 1- to 4-family residential loans during the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $5.1 million during the same period of the prior fiscal year. At December 31, 2022, fixed rate loans with remaining maturities in excess of 10 years totaled $335.6 million, or 11.3% of net loans receivable, as compared to $268.2 million, or 11.4% of net loans receivable at December 31, 2021. The Company originated $407.2 million in fixed rate commercial and commercial real estate loans during the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $295.8 million during the same period of the prior fiscal year. The Company also originated $82.8 million in adjustable rate commercial and commercial real estate loans during the six-month period ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $25.3 million during the same period of the prior fiscal year. At December 31, 2022, adjustable-rate home equity lines of credit increased to $50.6 million, as compared to $37.9 million at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, the Company’s investment portfolio had an expected weighted-average life of 5.8 years, compared to 4.3 years at December 31, 2021. Management continues to focus on customer retention, customer satisfaction, and offering new products to customers in order to increase the Company’s amount of less rate-sensitive deposit accounts.

514 ​ ​ Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on an internally generated model using actual maturity and repricing schedules for the Bank’s loans and deposits, and are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan repayments and deposit run-offs, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions the Bank may undertake in response to changes in interest rates. ​ Management cannot accurately predict future interest rates or their effect on the Bank’s net present value (“NPV”) in the future. Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of NPV. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have an initial fixed rate period typically from one to seven years and over the remaining life of the asset changes in the interest rate are restricted. In addition, the proportion of adjustable-rate loans in the Bank’s portfolios could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity if market interest rates remain steady in the future. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in the table. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable-rate debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. ​ The Company’s growth strategy has included origination of fixed-rate loans, as discussed under “Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk,” above. The Company’s interest rate sensitivity has increased during the six months ended December 31, 2022, and over the previous fiscal year, primarily as a result of these originations and the significant increase in market interest rates that has occurred. This increased sensitivity is reflected in the tables above. The Company’s above-trend loan growth in the six-months ended December 31, 2022, was attributable in part to the planned merger with Citizens, which will provide significant liquidity. Additionally, Citizens’ asset-sensitive balance sheet will serve to partially offset the Company’s liability sensitivity and exposure to rising interest rates. -59-

Item 4 :  Controls and Procedures SOUTHERN MISSOURI BANCORP, INC. An evaluation of Southern Missouri’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)  under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Act”)) as of December 31, 2022 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Administrative Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and several other members of our senior management.
Our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Administrative Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to management (including our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Administrative Officer and our Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The Company does not expect that its disclosures and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. ​ -61-
