– Background and Significant Accounting Policies
GB Sciences, Inc. (“the Company”, “GB Sciences”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a plant-inspired, biopharmaceutical research and development company creating patented, disease-targeted formulations of cannabis- and other plant-inspired therapeutic mixtures for the prescription drug market through its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, GbS Global Biopharma, Inc. (“GBSGB”).
Through GBSGB, the Company is engaged in the research and development of plant-inspired medicines, with virtual operations in North America and Europe. GBSGB’s assets include a portfolio of intellectual property containing both proprietary plant-inspired formulations and our AI-enabled drug discovery platform, as well as critical research contracts and key supplier arrangements. The Company’s intellectual property portfolio, which is held by GBSGB, contains
six
issued U.S. and
three
issued foreign patents, as well as
18
U.S. and
49
foreign patent-pending applications. On
October
14th,
2021,
we filed the nonprovisional USPTO patent application entitled “METHOD AND SYSTEMS FOR PHYTOMEDICINE ANALYTICS FOR RESEARCH OPTIMIZATION AT SCALE" to further protect aspects of our proprietary drug discovery engine, PhAROS™, which stands for
Ph ytomedical
A nalytics for
R esearch
O ptimization at
S cale. On
March
1st,
2022,
the Company’s newest patent was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a cannabinoid-containing mixture designed to treat cardiac hypertrophy, often present in advanced heart disease. The Company’s newly issued patent also covers the use of these receptor-targeted formulations for the treatment of
TRPV1 -receptor associated hearing loss and urinary cystitis.
GBSGB’s intellectual property covers a range of over
65
medical conditions, from which
five
drug development programs are in the preclinical stage of drug development including our formulations for Parkinson’s disease ("PD"), chronic pain, COVID-related cytokine release syndrome, depression/anxiety, and cardiovascular therapeutic programs. The Company’s primary focus is on preparing its lead program for the treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease for a
first -in-human clinical trial. Depending on the results of ongoing preclinical studies, the Company intends to move forward with clinical trials for its chronic pain and COVID-related cytokine release syndrome therapies after PD. The Company’s formulations for chronic pain, anxiety, and depression are currently in preclinical animal studies with researchers at the National Research Council Canada. The Company also recently received positive preclinical proof-of-concept data supporting its complex mixtures for the treatment of Cytokine Release Syndrome related to COVID- 19,
and its lead candidates will be optimized based on late-stage preclinical studies at Michigan State University. Proof-of-concept studies in animals that support our heart disease formulations have been successfully completed at the University of Hawaii. The Company runs a lean drug development program through GBSGB and takes effort to minimize expenses, including personnel, overhead, and fixed capital expenses through strategic partnerships with Universities and Contract Research Organizations (“CROs”). Our productive research and development network includes distinguished universities, hospitals, and Contract Research Organizations.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of GB Sciences, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10 -Q and Article
8
of Regulations S- X.
Accordingly, they do
not
include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the periods presented are
not
necessarily indicative of the results that
may
be expected for the year ending
March 31, 2023.
The balance sheet at
March 31, 2022
has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does
not
include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s annual report on Form
10 -K for the year ended
March 31, 2022 .
Principles of Consolidation
We prepare our consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the United States of America. Our consolidated financial statements include all operating divisions and majority-owned subsidiaries, reported as a single operating segment, for which we maintain controlling interests. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All subsidiaries were wholly owned by the Company for the periods presented.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and standard cost allocations, valuation of initial right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities, valuation of beneficial conversion features in convertible debt, valuation of the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, stock-based compensation expense, purchased intangible asset valuations, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, litigation, other loss contingencies, and impairment of long lived assets.  These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of costs and expenses that are
not
readily apparent from other sources. The actual results the Company experiences
may
differ materially and adversely from these estimates.
Discontinued Operations
See Note
3.
Indefinite and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily represent the value of our patents pending and includes the costs paid to draft and file patent applications. Upon issuance of the patents, the indefinite-lived intangible assets will have finite lives. We amortize our finite-lived intangible assets, which consist of granted patents, over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, and we periodically evaluate the remaining useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.
We review all of our intangible assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. Impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets is performed at least annually and we perform testing for definite-lived intangible assets whenever impairment indicators are present. If we determine that the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets during testing, we record impairment losses equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the fair market value of the asset.
At
December 31, 2022 , the Company had
six
patents that have been granted in the United States, including
two
licensed patents and
four
patents assigned to the Company's subsidiary, GBS Global Biopharma, Inc. The patents owned by the Company expire between
January 2038
and
May 2039.
Amortization expense for the
nine
months ended
December 31, 2022
and
2021 , was $ 61,660
and $ 28,829 , respectively. The carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets was $ 1,324,785
at
December 31, 2022 .
There were
18
United States patent applications that are pending as of
December 31, 2022 , and the corresponding patent assets are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The carrying amount of the indefinite-lived patent assets was $ 1,010,471
at
December 31, 2022 . In addition, the Company had $ 23,447
of indefinite-lived trademark assets at
December 31, 2022 .

Beneficial Conversion Feature of Convertible Notes Payable
The Company accounts for convertible notes payable in accordance with the guidelines established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic
470 - 20,  Debt with Conversion and Other Options and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
00 - 27,  “Application of Issue
No.
98 - 5
to Certain Convertible Instruments”.  A beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”) exists on the date a convertible note is issued when the fair value of the underlying common stock to which the note is convertible into is in excess of the remaining unallocated proceeds of the note after
first
considering the allocation of a portion of the note proceeds to the fair value of any attached equity instruments, if any related equity instruments were granted with the debt. In accordance with this guidance, the BCF of a convertible note is measured by allocating a portion of the note's proceeds to the warrants, if applicable, and as a reduction of the carrying amount of the convertible note equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion feature, both of which are credited to additional paid-in-capital. The Company calculates the fair value of warrants issued with the convertible notes using the Black-Scholes valuation model and uses the same assumptions for valuing any employee options in accordance with ASC Topic
718
Compensation – Stock Compensation. The only difference is that the contractual life of the warrants is used.
The value of the proceeds received from a convertible note is then allocated between the conversion features and warrants on a relative fair value basis. The allocated fair value is recorded in the financial statements as a debt discount (premium) from the face amount of the note and such discount is amortized over the expected term of the convertible note (or to the conversion date of the note, if sooner) and is charged to interest expense.
Revenue Recognition
The FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
606
as guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue recognition depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The guidance permits
two
methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). The Company adopted the guidance on
April 1, 2018
and applied the cumulative catch-up transition method.
The Company’s only material revenue source was part of discontinued operations prior to the sale of the Nevada Subsidiaries (Note
8 ), and was derived from sales of distinct physical goods. Under ASC
606,
the Company is required to separately identify each performance obligation resulting from its contracts from customers, which
may
be a good or a service. A contract
may
contain
one
or more performance obligations. All of the Company’s contracts with customers contained only a single performance obligation, the delivery of distinct physical goods. Because fulfillment of the company’s performance obligation to the customer under ASC
606
results in the same timing of revenue recognition as under the previous guidance (i.e. revenue is recognized upon delivery of physical goods), the Company did
not
record any material adjustment to report the cumulative effect of initial application of the guidance.

Income Taxes
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax items are reflected at the enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Due to the uncertainty regarding the success of future operations, management has valued the deferred tax asset allowance at
100%
of the related deferred tax assets.
Because the Company previously operated in the State-licensed cannabis industry through its now-deconsolidated Nevada Subsidiaries, gross profits from those subsidiaries was subject to the limitations of Internal Revenue Code Section
280E
( “280E” ) for U.S. income tax purposes. Under
280E,
the Company was allowed to deduct expenses that were directly related to the production of its products, i.e. cost of goods sold, but was allowed
no
further deductions for ordinary and necessary business expenses from its gross profit. The Company believes that the deductions disallowed include the deduction of net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs"). The unused NOLs will continue to carry forward and
may
be used by the Company to offset future taxable income that is
not
subject to the limitations of
280E.
Earnings and loss per Share
The Company’s basic earnings and loss per share has been calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company had
173,786,468
and  131,059,194
potentially dilutive common shares, related to convertible debt, warrants, and stock options, at
December 31, 2022
and
December 31, 2021 , respectively; however, those shares were
not
included in the computation of diluted net loss per share for the
nine
months ended
December 31, 2022 , as their inclusion would have been antidilutive. Of the potentially dilutive shares at
December 31, 2021,
106,174,448
and
104,447,872
were
not
included in the computation of  diluted EPS for the

respectively, as their inclusion would have been antidilutive. The computation of diluted EPS for the

Standards
Not
Yet Adopted
On
June 16, 2016,
the FASB issued ASU
No.
2016 - 13,
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The standard requires the use of an “expected loss” model on certain types of financial instruments. The standard also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and requires estimated credit losses to be recorded as allowances instead of reductions to amortized cost of the securities. The Company will adopt this ASU for the fiscal year beginning
April 1, 2023
and does
not
expect a material impact on its financial statements.
In
June 2020,
the FASB issued ASU
No.
2020 - 06,
Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity. The guidance simplifies the current guidance for convertible instruments and the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity. Additionally, the amendments affect the diluted EPS calculation for instruments that
may
be settled in cash or shares and for convertible instruments. This ASU will be effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning
April 1, 2024.
Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update must be applied on either full retrospective basis or modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit) in the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU
2020 - 06
on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as well as the timing of adoption.
All other newly issued accounting pronouncements have been deemed either immaterial or

– Going Concern
The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has sustained net losses since inception, which have caused an accumulated deficit of $ 105,840,040
at
December 31, 2022 . The Company had a working capital deficit of $ 3,962,864
at
December 31, 2022 , compared to a deficit of $ 3,607,638
at
March 31, 2022 . In addition, the Company has consumed cash in its operating activities of $ 1,306,971
for the
nine
months ended
December 31, 2022 , compared to $ 1,200,915
used in operating activities, including $ 87,772
used in discontinued operations for the
nine
months ended
December 31, 2021 . These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management has been able, thus far, to finance the losses through debt financings, a public offering, private placements and obtaining operating funds from stockholders. The Company is continuing to seek sources of financing.  There are
no
assurances that the Company will be successful in achieving its goals.
In view of these conditions, the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional financing or capital sources, to meet its financing requirements, and ultimately to achieve profitable operations. Management believes that its current and future plans provide an opportunity to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do
not
include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may
be necessary in the event the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

– Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations comprise those activities that were disposed of during the period or which were classified as held for sale at the end of the period and represent a separate major line of business or geographical area that can be clearly distinguished for operational and financial reporting purposes. The Company has included its subsidiaries GB Sciences Nevada, LLC, GB Sciences Las Vegas, LLC, and GB Sciences Nopah, LLC (the "Nevada Subsidiaries") in discontinued operations due to the sale of the Company's Nevada cultivation and extraction facilities. The assets and liabilities of the Nevada Subsidiaries were deconsolidated at
December 31, 2021
due to the completion of the sale on that date (Note
8 ).
There were
no
assets and liabilities associated with discontinued operations as of
December 31, 2022

the Company entered into the Second Promissory Note Modification Agreement, which reduced the total outstanding balance of principal and interest from $ 201,532
(at the time of the agreement) to $ 179,127
and modified the terms of the note to provide that the Company would make an immediate payment of $ 75,000 , with $ 5,000
monthly payments thereafter until the note is repaid in full. The modification also provided that the note would bear interest at
8.0 % per annum.
At
December 31, 2022 , the outstanding balance of the note was $ 69,143 , and accrued interest was $ 712 . The Company made regular payments totaling $ 40,000
during the
nine

Convertible Note Offerings
In
March 2017,
the Company entered into a Placement Agent’s Agreement with a
third -party brokerage firm to offer units consisting of a $ 1,000
6 % promissory note convertible into
4,000
shares of the Company’s common stock at $ 0.25
per share and
4,000
warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s’ common stock at an exercise price of $ 0.60
per share for the period of
three
years. Between
March 2017
and
May 2017,
the Company issued short-term Promissory Notes (“Notes”) to various holders with combined face value of $ 2,000,000 . The Notes are payable within
three
years of issuance and are convertible into
8,000,000
shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company also issued
8,000,000
common stock warrants to the Noteholders. The warrants are exercisable at any time and from time to time before maturity at the option of the holder. Each warrant gives the Noteholder the right to purchase
one
share of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $ 0.60
per share for a period of
three
years. The Company recorded an aggregate discount on convertible notes of $ 1,933,693 , which included $ 904,690
related to the relative fair value of beneficial conversion features and $ 1,029,003
for the relative fair value of the warrants issued with each note. The fair value of warrants was derived using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
In
July 2017,
the Company entered into a Placement Agent’s Agreement with a
third -party brokerage firm to offer units consisting of a $ 1,000
6 % promissory note convertible into
4,000
shares of the Company’s common stock at $ 0.25
per share and
4,000
warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s’ common stock at an exercise price of $ 0.65
per share for the period of
three
years. Between
July 2017
and
December 2017,
the Company issued short-term Promissory Notes (“Notes”) to various holders with combined face value of $ 7,201,000 . The Notes are payable within
three
years of issuance and are convertible into
28,804,000
shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company also issued
28,804,000
common stock warrants to the Note holders. The warrants are exercisable at any time and from time to time before maturity at the option of the holder. Each warrant gives the Noteholder the right to purchase
one
share of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $ 0.60
per share for a period of
three
years. The Company recorded an aggregate discount on convertible notes of $ 7,092,796 , which included $ 3,142,605
related to the relative fair value of beneficial conversion features and $ 3,950,191
for the relative fair value of the warrants issued with each note. The fair value of warrants was derived using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
All notes from the
March
and
July 2017
offerings have passed their maturity dates. During the year ended
March 31, 2022,
the Company agreed to extensions with the holders of a total of $ 197,000
of the $ 1,257,000
that remained outstanding at the time. For the
$197,000
of extended notes, the Company agreed to reduce the conversion price to $ 0.10
per share and issued a total of
788,000
additional warrants to the holders of the notes with a term of
three
years and an exercise price of $ 0.10
per share. In exchange, the maturity date of the notes was extended to
September 30, 2023.
Using the Black-Scholes model, the Company valued the warrants at $ 13,396
and the change in the fair value of the conversion feature at $ 33,490 . Because the change in the fair value of the conversion feature exceeded
10%
of the carrying amount of the notes, the Company accounted for the modification of the notes as an extinguishment and recorded a discount on the new convertible notes of $ 46,886
related to the fair value of the new warrants issued and the change in the fair value of the conversion feature. The Company recorded interest expense of $ 21,295
on the new notes during the
nine
months ended
December 31, 2022 , of which $ 12,389
represented amortization of the note discounts. Accrued interest on the
$197,000
extended notes is $ 65,058
and the remaining unamortized discount was $ 13,865
at
December 31, 2022 .
Three convertible notes totaling $ 1,060,000
held by the same investor remained outstanding during the year ended
March 31, 2022.
On
January 20, 2022,
the Company repaid $ 500,000
of the principal balances owed to the investor ( $500k
Notes"), and
one
convertible note in the amount of  $ 560,000
( "$560k
Note") remained outstanding plus accrued interest on all
three
notes totaling $ 294,497 . The notes do
not
provide for a default penalty or penalty interest rate. On
September 28, 2022,
the Company entered into the $ 560,000
Note Extension Agreement ( "$560k
Extension") with the investor. The
$560k
Extension provides that the due date of the
$560,000
Note is extended to
October 1, 2023,
and the interest rate of the
$560k
Note is increased to
8 % per annum beginning
October 1, 2022.
In addition, the Company agreed to make immediate payment of the outstanding accrued interest balance of
$129,534
on the

Notes. The Company made the payment of $ 129,534
on
October 5, 2022
and
no

At
December 31, 2022 , the accrued interest balance outstanding on the

O ptimization at
S cale. On March 1st, 2022, the Company’s newest patent was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a cannabinoid-containing mixture designed to treat cardiac hypertrophy, often present in advanced heart disease. The Company’s newly issued patent also covers the use of these receptor-targeted formulations for the treatment of TRPV1-receptor associated hearing loss and urinary cystitis.
GBSGB’s intellectual property covers a range of over 65 medical conditions, from which five drug development programs are in the preclinical stage of drug development including our formulations for Parkinson’s disease ("PD"), chronic pain, COVID-related cytokine release syndrome, depression/anxiety, and cardiovascular therapeutic programs. The Company’s primary focus is on preparing its lead program for the treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease for a first-in-human clinical trial. Depending on the results of ongoing preclinical studies, the Company intends to move forward with clinical trials for its chronic pain and COVID-related cytokine release syndrome therapies after PD. The Company’s formulations for chronic pain, anxiety, and depression are currently in preclinical animal studies with researchers at the National Research Council Canada. The Company also recently received positive preclinical proof-of-concept data supporting its complex mixtures for the treatment of Cytokine Release Syndrome related to COVID-19, and its lead candidates will be optimized based on late-stage preclinical studies at Michigan State University. Proof-of-concept studies in animals that support our heart disease formulations have been successfully completed at the University of Hawaii. The Company runs a lean drug development program through GBSGB and takes effort to minimize expenses, including personnel, overhead, and fixed capital expenses through strategic partnerships with Universities and Contract Research Organizations (“CROs”). Our productive research and development network includes distinguished universities, hospitals, and Contract Research Organizations.
On April 4, 2014, we changed our name from Signature Exploration and Production Corporation to Growblox Sciences, Inc.

Plan of Operation
Drug Discovery and Development of Novel Cannabis-Based Therapies
Through its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, GBS Global Biopharma, Inc. ("GBSGB"), the Company has conducted ground-breaking research embracing the rational design of plant-inspired medicines led by Dr. Andrea Small-Howard, the Company’s President, Chief Science Officer, and Director. In the early days, Small-Howard and Dr. Helen Turner, Vice President of Innovation and Dean of the Natural Sciences and Mathematics Department at Chaminade University, posited that minimum essential mixtures of plant-based ingredients would provide more targeted and effective treatments for specific disease conditions than either single ingredient or whole plant formulations. They started with cannabis-based drug discovery and developed a rapid screening and assaying system that tested thousands of combinations of cannabinoids and terpenes in vitro against cell-based models of disease. This process identified precise mixtures of cannabinoids and terpenes, many of which contained no THC, to treat categories of disease conditions, including neurological disorders, inflammation, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and chronic neuropathic pain. More recently, a similar approach has been applied to the discovery and validation of therapies informed by plants described in a variety of Traditional Medical Systems. These rich discovery efforts have yielded new preclinical programs; for example, our anxiety and depression formulations that contain minimum essential mixtures of compounds derived from plants in the Piper plant family, such as kava.
Currently, the Company’s drug discovery engine involves both a data analytics/machine learning tool to expedite drug discovery and high throughput screening of cell and animal models of disease. As previously mentioned, the Company initially explored the potential medical uses of specific mixtures derived from cannabis-based raw materials, but our early
in silico
tools have now been improved, and they are becoming increasingly effective for investigating the medical applications of potential therapeutic mixtures from any plant-derived starting material. In 2014, the Company developed its first rapid screening and assaying system which tested thousands of combinations of cannabinoids and terpenes against cell-based models of diseases. This process has been refined over the years and now has identified precise mixtures of cannabinoids and terpenes, many of which contained no THC, to treat categories of disease conditions, including neurological disorders, inflammation, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, chronic and neuropathic pain. Through GBSGB, the Company has filed for patent protection on these plant-inspired, minimum essential mixtures, and they are validating them in disease-specific animal models in preparation for human trials.
The Company’s drug discovery process combines: 1) PhAROS™: Phytomedical Analytics for Research Optimization at Scale for the prediction of minimum essential mixtures from plant-based materials, and 2) HTS: high throughput screening to refine and validate plant-inspired, minimum essential mixtures in well-established cell and animal models of diseases. This combined approach to drug discovery increases research efficiency and accuracy reducing the time from ideation to patenting from 7 years to 1.5 years. The Company now uses its PhAROS™ Drug Discovery Platform to ‘pre-validate’ therapeutic mixtures. PhAROS can both prioritize and eliminate some potential combinations, which reduces time and resources used in the discovery period. PhAROS™ can also be used to identify and predict the efficacy of plant-inspired, minimum essential mixtures for specific diseases
in silico , which are then tested by screening in cell and animal models. Screening of plant-inspired mixtures for drug discovery involves the testing of specific combinations of plant chemicals from many naturally occurring plants and the use of live models for these diseases that have been well established by other researchers. The Company refines the potential therapeutic mixtures pre-validated by PhAROS™ to optimize their effectiveness using cell and animal models. Based on data from disease-specific assays, therapeutic formulations are refined during the HTS screening process by removing compounds that do not act synergistically with the others in the mixtures. The goal is to identify minimum essential mixtures (MEM) that retain the efficacy of the whole plant extracts, but with the manufacturing and quality control advantages of single ingredient pharmaceutical products.
In October of 2021, GBSGB began its first preclinical animal trial of non-cannabis-based formulations that were discovered and pre-validated using our PhAROS™ drug discovery platform. The National Research Council of Canada (“NRC”) are testing the Company’s proprietary, psychotropic plant-based formulas for the treatment of depression and anxiety. For these novel psychotropic drug candidates, the Company used the PhAROS™ platform to identify new ingredients to improve upon an initial formulation for anxiety based on traditional medicine. The original plant mixture was derived from the kava plant, but some elements of kava are thought to cause liver toxicity. PhAROS™ identified ingredients from the Piper plant family as a substitute for the functionality of the ingredients in question without the potentially adverse safety profiles of those original ingredients. The Piper plant family includes pepper plants that are used worldwide in traditional medicines. The Company’s new psychotropic formulations are currently in preclinical trials at the Zebrafish Toxicology, Genomics and Neurobiology Lab at the NRC, led by Dr. Lee Ellis, Research Officer and Team Lead. The ongoing work between the NRC and the Company has produced strong and applicable data for the evaluation of its therapies, and this trial could provide novel treatment options for patients with depression and anxiety.
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office allows complex mixtures to be claimed as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ("APIs"). Through GBSGB, the Company has six issued patents, plus a series of pending patents containing plant-derived complex mixtures and minimum essential mixtures that act as therapeutic agents for specific disease categories, as described below. The Company’s pending patents are protected whether the individual compounds are derived from the cannabis plant, another plant, synthetically produced, or derived from a combination of sources for the individual chemical compounds in these mixtures. On March 1st, 2022, the Company’s newest patent was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a cannabinoid-containing mixture designed to treat cardiac hypertrophy, often present in advanced heart disease. The Company’s newly issued patent also covers the use of these receptor-targeted formulations for the treatment of TRPV1-receptor associated hearing loss and urinary cystitis. This year, our growing intellectual property portfolio was augmented with additional patent-protections for our PhAROS™ drug discovery platform, new PhAROS™ discovered, non-cannabis formulations, and improved formulations for our PD therapeutics.

Drug Development Progress
The Company has made significant strides in the past year with respect to both its drug discovery research and product development programs. The Company, through GBSGB, now has five preclinical phase product development programs and is aggressively preparing its lead formulations for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease for a first-in-human clinical trial. Our lead program in Parkinson’s disease is being prepared for a first-in-human trial through the following essential steps: a) creating clinical prototypes by combining our proprietary Parkinson’s formulas with a convenient oral delivery system; b) performing a dose response study in rodents to establish the correct range of active ingredients for our first-in-human trial; c) performing necessary ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicology) tests on the clinical prototypes; and d) selecting a Contract Research Organization (CRO) to prepare an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the US FDA to begin our first-in-human trial. In addition to our work in preparing the Parkinson’s formulation for a First-in-Human trial, the Company’s chronic pain, anxiety, and depression formulations are currently in preclinical animal studies with Dr. Lee Ellis of the National Research Council ("NRC") Canada in Halifax, Nova Scotia. We received positive preclinical, proof-of-concept data supporting our minimum essential mixtures for the treatment of Cytokine Release Syndrome in COVID-19 (COVID-CRS) and other severe hyperinflammatory conditions. GBSGB’s lead COVID-CRS candidates will be optimized based on late-stage preclinical studies with Dr. Norbert Kaminski at Michigan State University.
For the Company’s lead program in PD therapeutics, the efficacy of our original formulations has been improved and the Company has filed a new patent application family to protect our defined cannabinoid ratio-minimum essential mixtures (DCR-MEMs) for the treatment of Parkinsonian motor symptoms. The Company had announced previously that it has obtained the statistically significant reduction of Parkinson’s-disease like symptoms using proprietary cannabinoid-containing MEMs in an animal model of Parkinson’s disease ("PD"). Three of the Company’s PD formulations significantly reduced the PD-like motor symptoms. In addition, the toxicity studies for these original PD formulas came back without any significant negative findings. These initial efficacious PD formulations were equimolar minimum essential mixtures (E-MEMs), wherein, each contained three cannabinoids combined at an equimolar ratio (1:1:1). In the past year 2020-2021, the Company has screened an additional sixty-three variations of the original three equimolar MEMs and identified a total of twenty-two DCR-MEMs with optimized ratios of cannabinoids that produced a statistically significant reduction in OHDA induced motor symptoms. Five of these twenty-two efficacious MEMs outperformed the original equimolar cannabinoid MEMs. A new patent application has been filed to protect these DCR-MEMs. These important preclinical results will be included in GBS’ Investigational New Drug ("IND") application with the US FDA to enter human clinical trials as soon as possible. New therapies to address Parkinson’s disease symptoms are needed to help those afflicted with this debilitating disease. The combined direct and indirect costs associated with Parkinson’s disease are estimated at $52 billion in the U.S. alone.
This year, we are working with Catalent Pharma on the preparation of clinical prototypes of our proprietary cannabinoid-based formulations for Parkinson’s disease in Catalent Pharma’s proprietary Zydis® delivery system. Catalent Pharma’s Zydis® delivery system is an Orally Disintegrating Tablet format (“ODT”) that should be ideal for delivering our cannabinoid-ratio controlled formulations to Parkinson’s patients. More than 50% of Parkinson’s patients have trouble swallowing, but the Zydis® format delivers the active ingredients into the mouth by dispersion without needing water or the ability to swallow. To ready the Company’s Parkinson’s disease therapies for a First-in-Human trial, the initial clinical prototypes of our Defined Cannabinoid Ratio (DCR)-MEM have been formulated by Catalent Pharma using Catalent’s Zydis® Orally Disintegrating Tablet technology and they are being evaluated in stability and functional testing. As mentioned above, the ODT format was selected for the PD formulas because it dissolves on the tongues of patients without the need to swallow for ease of use in patients with PD, who often have difficulties with swallowing. Previously, the Company has completed two proof-of-concept studies for its MEM. Now, the Company is performing a Feasibility Study that will produce and validate the clinical prototypes for its DCR-MEM. The Company selected Catalent for the delivery of their PD therapies due to Catalent’s prior experience in working on US FDA-approved, cannabinoid-containing drugs, their Schedule I drug manufacturing facilities, their familiarity with US FDA and international regulatory and manufacturing requirements, their expertise in tackling formulation challenges, and their ability to achieve the stability and dosing necessary for these novel therapeutic mixtures. In addition to its Zydis® technology, Catalent has early drug development services and additional oral drug delivery solutions available for the efficient delivery of the Company's proprietary APIs.

Additionally, the Company has selected the University of Lethbridge to start our required dose response study in a rodent model of Parkinson’s disease, which will help us to establish the correct dosing for our first-in-human trial. Prior to filing our IND application, we must conduct ADMET testing on the clinical prototypes of our Parkinson’s medication being formulated for us by Catalent Pharma. The Company has identified a Contract Research Organization that will perform the ADMET testing. In the IND application for our novel Parkinson’s disease therapy, the ADMET testing data will be combined with the Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) data prepared by Catalent Pharma and our proof-of-concept data (National Research Council Canada). In the near future, we expect to announce the selection of the Contract Research Organization that will write the IND-application and run the first-in-human trials for our novel treatment for the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
For its lead chronic pain program, the Company is testing its MEM for chronic pain both as encapsulated, time-released nanoparticles, as well as in non-encapsulated forms of these therapeutic mixtures in an animal model at the NRC in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In preparation for human clinical trials, our standard MEM and the time-released MEM are currently being compared in an animal model that demonstrates their potential effectiveness at treating chronic pain. The early results from this preclinical research project look very promising. However, the COVID pandemic adversely affected the progress on this study, but we are happy to report that we are back on track to continue with the testing of these promising chronic pain formulations.
In late summer of 2021, the Company received positive proof-of-concept data from a human immune cell model supporting the efficacy of their proprietary MEM designed for the suppression of COVID-related, cytokine release syndromes (CRS) while preserving key anti-viral immune responses. Based on this new positive proof-of-concept data, GBSGB converted their provisional patent application entitled, “CANNABINOID-CONTAINING COMPLEX MIXTURES FOR THE TREATMENT OF CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME WHILE PRESERVING KEY ANTI-VIRAL IMMUNE REACTIONS” to a nonprovisional patent application on August 18, 2021. The best performing MEM will be further developed in preparation for clinical studies to evaluate their anti-inflammatory potential in the treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients contending with Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and associated hyperinflammatory conditions, such as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). CRS, MAS, and ARDS are the leading causes of deaths in COVID-19 patients. The Company’s proof-of-concept study was performed at Michigan State University using a state-of-the-science human immune model. In the Company’s proof-of-concept study, immune cells from human donors were co-cultured together in one of four treatment groups: untreated (no inflammatory stimulus), inflammatory stimulus, control (inflammatory stimulus + vehicle from cannabinoid mixtures), or pre-treatment with the cannabinoid mixture + inflammatory stimulus. Then a panel of cytokines and inflammatory markers was measured from each of these treatment groups from different immune cell types within the co-cultured cells at four time points to determine whether the Company’s MEMs were able to alter the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines or other inflammatory agents. The Company’s COVID-CRS formulations showed potential for the selective inhibition of pro-inflammatory processes in response to viral- and bacterial-triggered hyperinflammation in a human immune cell model. These positive proof-of-concept results support the potential for some of these mixtures to accomplish our therapeutic goals, but, ultimately, clinical trial results will determine whether they are efficacious. The Company’s plant-based drug discovery platform is advancing biopharmaceutical research at a time when thousands are dying from COVID-19. The next step is to further develop our plant-inspired drugs and eventually bring them to human trials so that the use of well-defined cannabinoid mixtures in clinical practice can become a reality.

As mentioned above, the Company announced that the NRC Canada is testing our proprietary, psychotropic plant-based formulas for the treatment of depression and anxiety in preclinical animal studies. The Company has leveraged its patent-pending PhAROS™ (Phytomedical Analytics for Research Optimization at Scale) platform to identify these combinations of plant compounds for novel drug candidates to treat depression and anxiety. These are the company’s first non-cannabis formulations to enter preclinical studies. For these novel psychotropic drug candidates, the Company used the PhAROS™ platform to identify new ingredients to improve upon an initial formulation for anxiety based on traditional medicine. The original plant mixture was derived from the kava plant, but some elements of kava are thought to cause liver toxicity. PhAROS™ identified ingredients from the Piper plant family as a substitute for the functionality of the ingredients in question without the potentially adverse safety profiles of those original ingredients. The Piper plant family includes pepper plants that are used worldwide in traditional medicines. The Global Anxiety Disorder and Depression Treatment Market size is forecast to reach USD 19.81 Billion by 2028 according to Reports & Data.
Favorable Research Updates from our university collaborators reveal the promise in our discovery programs including: 1) Multiple MEM discovery projects using and advancing our proprietary PhAROS™ drug discovery platform in conjunction with Chaminade University, 2) the Company’s Cannabis Metabolomics Project with both Chaminade University of Honolulu, Hawai’i and the University of Athens, Greece, and 3) the Company’s Time-Released Nanoparticles for Delivery of Cannabis-based Ingredients with the University of Seville, Spain and the University of Cadiz, Spain.
This year, our growing intellectual property portfolio was augmented with additional patent-protections for our PhAROS™ drug discovery platform that were filed in July of 2021 and in October of 2021. The Company, through GBSGB, also filed for protection of new PhAROS™ discovered, non-cannabis formulations in July of 2021. In September of 2021, the Company filed a patent application for the Company’s improved DCR-MEM formulations for our PD therapeutic program. These new patent applications expanded upon the solid foundation of intellectual property developed over the past six years. In 2020, the three patents which protect formulations for the Company’s lead therapeutic programs were issued by the USPTO. The issuance of U.S. Patent No. 10,653,640 entitled "Cannabinoid-Containing Complex Mixtures for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases" on May 19, 2020 protects methods of using GBSGB’s proprietary cannabinoid-containing complex mixtures (CCCM™) for treating Parkinson’s Disease. This was an important milestone in the development of these vitally important therapies and validates GBSGB’s drug discovery platform. In the US alone, the combined direct and indirect costs associated with Parkinson’s disease are estimated at $52 billion, and new therapies to address Parkinson’s disease symptoms are greatly needed. This was also the first time that a US patent has been awarded for a cannabis-based complex mixture defined using this type of drug discovery method. The first US patent for PD therapies validated our drug discovery platform and strengthened our intellectual property portfolio of unique CCCM’s™, each targeting one of up to 60 specific clinical applications.
The issuance of the Company’s second and third US patents for active pharmaceutical ingredients that are complex mixtures identified by our biotech platform further confirmed that the Company’s pharmaceutical compositions can be patent protected for use as biopharmaceutical and nutraceutical products. The US Patent entitled “Myrcene-Containing Complex Mixtures Targeting TRPV1” protects methods of using our proprietary MEMs for the treatment of pain disorders related to arthritis, shingles, irritable bowel syndrome, sickle cell disease, and endometriosis. In the US alone, chronic pain represents an estimated health burden of between $560 and $650 billion dollars, and an estimated 20.4% of U.S. adults suffer from chronic pain that significantly decreases their quality of life. Despite the widespread rates of addiction and death, opioids remain the standard of care treatment for most people with chronic pain. The Company believes that it is important to create safer, less addictive alternatives to opioids for the treatment of chronic pain disorders, like GBSGB’s myrcene-containing MEMs.
The Company's third issued US Patent entitled "Cannabinoid-Containing Complex Mixtures for the Treatment of Mast-Cell-Associated or Basophil-Mediated Inflammatory Disorders" protects methods of using the Company’s proprietary MEMs for treating Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). MCAS is a severe immunological condition in which mast cells inappropriately and excessively release inflammatory mediators, resulting in a range of severe chronic hyperinflammatory symptoms and life-threatening anaphylaxis attacks. Receiving this patent for the treatment of MCAS using our MEMs is an important milestone in the development of this urgently needed medicine. There is no single recommended treatment for MCAS patients. Instead, they attempt to manage MCAS symptoms primarily by avoiding ‘triggers’ and using rescue medicines for their severe hyperinflammatory attacks. Therefore, MCAS patients need new therapeutic options to control their mast cell related symptoms, and our MEMs were designed to simultaneously control multiple inflammatory pathways within mast cells as a comprehensive treatment option. The Company is strategically targeting MCAS for two additional reasons. By focusing on a rare disease with no known cure, our company can apply for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s expedited approval process, which allows clinically successful treatments to get to market both quicker and more cost effectively. Gaining approval from the US FDA for the entire anti-inflammatory market would be extremely time consuming and cost prohibitive. Demonstrating that our MEMs are safe for the treatment of MCAS would favorably position our Company for clinical testing of these MEMs as potential treatments for other related inflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, thereby widening the target market and drastically shortening the development cycle and costs.
The Company’s fourth US Patent was issued on March 1, 2022 for a cannabinoid-containing mixture designed to treat cardiac hypertrophy, often present in advanced heart disease. Gb Sciences’ newly issued patent also covers the use of these receptor-targeted formulations for the treatment of TRPV1-receptor associated hearing loss and urinary cystitis. Despite multiple categories of prescription heart medications on the market, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States for people of most racial and ethnic groups. Alternative therapeutic approaches are still needed, especially for the treatment of advanced heart disease. The market for prescription heart disease medications is predicted to rise to $64 billion dollars in the US by 2026, with future market growth fueled by innovative new therapeutic approaches.

Partnering Strategy
The Company runs a lean drug development program and minimizes expenses, including personnel, overhead, and fixed capital expenses (such as lab and diagnostic equipment), through strategic partnerships with universities, hospitals, suppliers, Contract Research Organizations (“CROs”), and Contract Manufacturing Organizations (“CMOs”). Through these research and development agreements, the Company has created a virtual pipeline for the further development of novel medicines based on ingredients originally derived from the cannabis plant and other plant-based traditional medicines. The partners bring both expertise and infrastructure at a reasonable cost to the life sciences program. In most instances, the Company has also negotiated with these partners to keep 100% of the ownership of the IP within GBSGB for original patent filings.
The Company currently has on-going research agreements with the following institutions covering the indicated areas of research:
Chaminade University: Broad-based research program to support the drug discovery platform that has yielded many of the Company’s original patents to date in the areas of neurodegenerative diseases, heart disease, inflammatory diseases, neuropathic and chronic pain. They have also performed the bioassay portion of the Cannabis Metabolomics study performed with the University of Athens, Greece and the Company. Our collaborations with Chaminade also led to the development of our PhAROS™ drug discovery platform.
University of Athens: Broad-based metabolomics analysis of over 100 cannabis genotypes including both hemp and THC-producing cannabis varieties, in combination with the Company’s bioassay data linking genotypes and potential disease-remediations. This project has the potential to define active ingredients from plant-derived mixtures beyond the standard cannabinoids and terpenoids. The discovery potential is huge, and novel agents have recently been discovered. Novel ligands have been identified and are being validated. This project will ultimately yield novel patent-protected therapies.
Michigan State University: Preclinical work using a cutting-edge, multi-cellular model of the human immune system and a multi-cell model of the brain to validate our MEMs for use in the treatment of COVID-19-related cytokine release syndromes (COVID-CRS). MSU has performed experiments using their novel model of the human-immune system that have allowed GBSGB to prepare cannabis-based formulas for the potential treatment of virally-induced hyperinflammation/cytokine storm syndrome that has led to the majority of COVID-19 deaths. Positive proof-of-concept results have guided the development of these selectively anti-inflammatory MEM.
The University of Seville: Bringing their novel expertise to the development and functional testing of time-released and disease-targeted nanoparticles of cannabis-based minimum essential mixtures for oral administration. These specialized nanoparticles are being used for the precise and time-released delivery of several of our therapies, including the Company’s chronic pain MEMs used in the preclinical animal testing performed at the NRC Canada. The University of Seville has completed functional testing on nanoparticles containing myrcene, nerolidol, and beta-caryophyllene for our chronic pain MEMs. In cell-based assays, the effectiveness and kinetics of the nanoparticle-forms of these terpenes were compared with the “naked” terpenes both individually and in mixtures. In all cases, the effectiveness of the nanoparticles was superior to the naked terpenes, however, the mixtures were dramatically more effective than the individuals. Recently, our partners at the University of Seville have completed the formulation of new cannabis-based ingredients for inclusion into the oral, time-released nanoparticle format for the completion of our maximally effective MEMs for chronic pain. The results from Seville are very promising, and these nanoparticles have entered the animal testing phase at the NRC in Halifax.
The National Research Center (NRC) of Canada, Halifax, Nova Scotia: Four animal-phase studies are being performed by Dr. Lee Ellis’ group at the NRC. 1) Parkinson’s Disease: In Q1 of 2020, an animal safety and efficacy study was completed for the Company’s equimolar MEMs for the treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, and the NRC has demonstrated that the company’s PD formulations were able to reduce behavioral changes associated with the loss of dopamine-producing neurons, which underlies the pathology of Parkinson’s disease in the animal model. Based on achieving the statistically significant reduction in Parkinson’s disease symptomology in these equimolar MEMs, the Company completed a final phase of testing in August of 2021, which identified five defined cannabinoid ratio (DCR)-MEMs that were more effective than the root equimolar MEM. 2) Chronic Pain: In Q1 of 2019, the Company started a safety and efficacy study in animals for our Chronic Pain (CP) formulas. The midterm results for these preclinical pain studies were promising, but the study was significantly delayed by the COVID pandemic. These preclinical studies have resumed and are progressing well. 3 & 4) Depression and Anxiety: Minimum essential mixtures of plant-based ingredients from kava and the related Piper plant family are being evaluated now.
The University of Cadiz: Testing the safety and efficacy of the above-mentioned time-released nanoparticles in rodent models of chronic pain. Proof of concept complete for one formulation.
University of Hawaii: Validating the efficacy of a complex cannabis-based mixture for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac disease in a rodent model. Proof of concept work is complete in rodents, and we are seeking commercialization partners.

Path to Market: Drug Development Stages and Proposed Clinical Trials
The Company has plant-based therapeutic products in the following stages of drug development: Discovery, Pre-Clinical, and entering the Clinical Phase. It has also licensed therapeutic products that the Company intends to develop through partners, labeled Partner Programs.
The completion of discovery, preclinical studies, clinical trials, and the required regulatory submissions required for obtaining US FDA pre-market approvals for pharmaceutical products (and equivalent approvals from other corresponding agencies worldwide) is traditionally a long and expensive process. However, the Company asserts that its proprietary, PhAROS™, AI-enabled, drug discovery engine; plant-inspired formulations; lean development program; novel regulatory strategy; experienced development partners; and aggressive licensing of these products at early clinical stages can mitigate some of the risks. The Company uses a combination of  in silico
discovery methods and automated screening of cellular and animal models of disease to decrease the time in Discovery prior to filing novel patent applications for disease-specific therapeutics. Through GBSGB, the Company’s original patent applications cover new chemical entities (“NCE”) based on discovery and validation of minimum essential mixtures derived from complex, plant-based therapeutics. The Company plans to use an Exploratory IND/Phase 0 Program that gets the Company to First-in-Human sooner than traditional programs, which reduces translational risks, and includes preliminary efficacy measures for responsible development decisions. In contrast, a traditional phased-development path would not provide any efficacy measures until Phase II. After the completion of our Phase 0 study for PD, which compares the efficacies of multiple related cannabinoid-based formulations, the Company plans to advance the lead PD drug candidate using an adaptive trial design that is more efficient than the traditional phased-development pathway. Through GBSGB, the Company has entered into research contracts, partnerships, and/or joint ventures with several respected, independent contract research organizations, medical schools, universities, and with other scientific consultants to increase developmental efficiencies. If and when one or more of the Company’s drugs, therapies or treatments are approved by the US FDA, the Company will seek to market them under licensing arrangements with major biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.
There can be no assurance that we will ever be able to enter into any joint ventures or other arrangements with third parties to finance our drug development program or that if we are able to do so, that any of our projected therapies will ever be approved by the US FDA. Even if we obtain US FDA approval to market one of our therapies, there can be no assurance that it could be successfully marketed or would not be superseded by another plant-based therapy produced by one or more of our competitors. It also may be anticipated that even if we enter into a joint venture development with a financially stable pharmaceutical or institutional partner, we will still be required to raise significant additional capital in the future to achieve the strategic goals of the Company. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional capital on reasonable terms, if at all. If the Company fails to achieve its goal of producing one or more plant-inspired pharmaceuticals or therapies, it would have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and business prospects.
Other Operations
On March 24, 2020, the Company entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ("Teco MIPA") with AJE Management, LLC. Pursuant to the Teco MIPA, the Company agreed to sell 100% of its membership interests in GB Sciences Nevada, LLC, and GB Sciences Las Vegas, LLC (the "Teco Subsidiaries") for approximately $8 million, which amount includes a cash payment at closing, the extinguishment of certain liabilities owed to the purchaser and affiliates of the purchaser, and an 8% promissory note.
On August 10, 2020, the Company entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ("Nopah MIPA") and Promissory Note Modification Agreement with 483 Management, LLC. Pursuant to the Nopah MIPA, the Company agreed to sell its 100% membership interest in GB Sciences Nopah, LLC ("Nopah"), which holds a Nevada medical marijuana cultivation certificate. As consideration, the Company would receive $300,000 as a reduction to the balance of the 0% Note payable dated October 23, 2017 and accounts payable of $74,647, which were owed to an affiliate of the purchaser.
The closing of the Teco and Nopah sales was contingent upon the successful transfer of the Nevada cultivation and production licenses. On December 14, 2021, the Company received approval from the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board for the transfer of cannabis cultivation and extraction licenses held by its subsidiaries GB Sciences Nevada, LLC, GB Sciences Las Vegas, LLC, and GB Sciences Nopah, LLC (the "Nevada Subsidiaries"). Consequently, all conditions to closing the sales of the 100% membership interests in the Nevada Subsidiaries were satisfied, and the transactions formally closed on December 31, 2021. After the closing date, the Company retains no ownership interest in the Nevada Subsidiaries.

Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses decreased by $105,486 to $407,302 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $512,788 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, and decreased by $275,080 to $1,142,658 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1,417,738 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is attributable in part to the completion of a research contract with Michigan State University for which the Company had recorded expense of $100,690 in the prior nine month period. In addition, the Company is continuing its efforts to maintain administrative costs at a minimum and to make the best use of its limited resources in advancing research & development of the Company's intellectual property portfolio.
Interest and Other Income
Interest expense decreased by $118,008 to $41,470 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $159,478 in the prior year quarter. Other expense was $15,639 in the prior year quarter. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, interest expense decreased by $202,716 to $117,260 compared to $319,976 in the nine months ended December 31, 2021, and other expense was $6,639 for the prior year nine months.
The decrease in both periods is attributable to less debt outstanding as the result of the repayment of $500,000 debt principal during the March 31, 2022 quarter and a decrease in amortization expense from debt discounts during the current year period as the result of prior amortization of discounts on outstanding debt.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Current Liquidity
The Company will need additional capital to implement its strategies. There is no assurance that it will be able to raise the amount of capital needed for future growth plans. Even if financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable. If unable to raise the necessary capital at the times required, the Company may have to materially change the business plan, including delaying implementation of aspects of the business plan or curtailing or abandoning the business plan. The Company represents a speculative investment and investors may lose all of their investment. In order to be able to achieve the strategic goals, the Company needs to further expand its business and financing activities. Based on the Company's cash position, it is necessary to raise additional capital by the end of the next quarter in order to continue to fund current operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company is pursuing several alternatives to address this situation, including the raising of additional funding through equity or debt financing. In order to finance existing operations and pay current liabilities over the next twelve months, the Company will need to raise additional capital. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis, or at all, in the future.
The principal sources of liquidity to date have been cash generated from sales of debt and equity securities and loans along with the sale of our subsidiaries.
At  December 31, 2022, cash was $274,038, other current assets excluding cash were $159,185, and our working capital deficit was $3,962,864. Current liabilities were $4,396,087 and consisted principally of $1,751,820 in accounts payable, $360,090 in accrued liabilities, $1,387,682 in notes and convertible notes payable, and and a federal income tax liability related to the Company's past ownership of the Nevada Subsidiaries of $896,495.
At March 31, 2022, cash was $233,893, other current assets excluding cash were $93,933, and our working capital deficit was $3,607,638. Current liabilities were $3,935,464, which consisted principally of $1,657,008 in accounts payable, $394,396 in accrued liabilities, $987,565 in notes and convertible notes payable, and an income tax liability related to the Company's past ownership of the Nevada Subsidiaries of $896,495.

Sources and Uses of Cash
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $1,306,971 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash used of $1,200,915, including $87,772 used in operating activities of discontinued operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. We anticipate that cash flows from operations will be insufficient to fund business operations for the next twelve-month period. Accordingly, we will have to generate additional liquidity or cash flow to fund our current and anticipated operations. This will likely require the sale of additional common stock or other securities. There is no assurance that we will be able to realize any significant proceeds from such sales, if at all.
Investing Activities
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, $31,650 was used in investing activities for the acquisition of intangible assets. During the nine months ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by investing activities was $1,550,339, which consists of $1,648,772 in proceeds from the sale of the Nevada Subsidiaries, offset by $100,000 paid to acquire intangible assets and $1,567 provided by investing activities of discontinued operations.
Financing Activities
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $1,378,766, including $1,625,000 in gross proceeds from sales of the Company's common stock in a private placement, offset by $207,350 in brokerage fees and $34,984 of principal payments on a note payable. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 included $62,660 proceeds from warrant exercises and $50,000 proceeds from a convertible note, offset by $103,387 used in discontinued operations.
Going Concern
The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has sustained net losses since inception, which have caused an accumulated deficit of $105,840,040 at December 31, 2022. The Company had a working capital deficit of $3,962,864 at December 31, 2022, compared to a deficit of $3,607,638 at March 31, 2022. In addition, the Company has consumed cash in its operating activities of $1,306,971 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1,200,915 used in operating activities, including $87,772 used in discontinued operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management has been able, thus far, to finance the losses through debt financings, a public offering, private placements and obtaining operating funds from stockholders. The Company is continuing to seek sources of financing.  There are no assurances that the Company will be successful in achieving its goals.
In view of these conditions, the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional financing or capital sources, to meet its financing requirements, and ultimately to achieve profitable operations. Management believes that its current and future plans provide an opportunity to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary in the event the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

VARIABLES AND TRENDS
In the event the Company is able to obtain the necessary financing to progress with its business plan, the Company expects expenses to increase significantly to grow the business. Accordingly, the comparison of the financial data for the periods presented may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance and must be considered in light of these circumstances.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A description of the Company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 3 of its Annual Report on Form 10–K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.
ITEM 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
As a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item.
ITEM 4.  Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company  maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in the periodic reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or 1934 Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. At the end of the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that as of December 31, 2022, the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses as no member of our board of directors qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
Management, including the Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), does not expect that disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Changes in Internal Controls
During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, there have been no changes in the internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the internal controls over financial reporting.
