Disclosure Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that we believe are, or may be considered to be, “forward-looking statements”. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this document regarding the prospects of our industry or our prospects, plans, financial position or business strategy may constitute forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “foresee,” “project,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “plan,” “forecast,” “continue” or “could” or the negative of these terms or variations of them or similar terms. Furthermore, forward-looking statements may be included in various filings that we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”), press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that these expectations will prove to be correct. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in these forward-looking statements. These known and unknown risks include, without limitation: marijuana remains illegal under U.S. federal law, and enforcement of cannabis laws could change; the Company may face limitations on ownership of cannabis licenses; the Company may become subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Company may face difficulties acquiring additional financing; the Company operates in a highly regulated sector and may not always succeed in complying fully with applicable regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where we carry on business; the Company is subject to general economic risks; the Company may be negatively impacted by challenging global economic condition; the Company is subject to risks arising from epidemic diseases, such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19; the Company may face difficulties in enforcing its contracts; the Company is subject to taxation in Canada and the United States; cannabis businesses are subject to unfavorable tax treatment; cannabis businesses may be subject to civil asset forfeiture; the Company is subject to proceeds of crime statutes; the Company faces security risks; competition for the acquisition and leasing of properties suitable for the cultivation, production and sale of medical and adult use cannabis may impede our ability to make acquisitions or increase the cost of these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition; the Company faces risks related to its products; the Company is dependent on the popularity of consumer acceptance of the Company’s brand portfolio; the Company faces risks related to its insurance coverage and uninsurable risks; the Company is dependent on key inputs, suppliers and skilled labor; the Company must attract and maintain key personnel; the Company’s business is subject to the risks inherent in agricultural operations; the Company’s sales are difficult to forecast; the Company’s products may be subject to product recalls; the Company may face unfavorable publicity or consumer perception; the Company faces intense competition; and additional issuances of Subordinate Voting Shares may result in dilution. Further information on these and other potential factors that could affect the Company’s business and financial condition and the results of operations are included in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 9, 2022, and elsewhere in the Company’s filings with the SEC, which are available on the SEC’s website or on the Company’s website at https://investors.medmen.com/. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements contained in this document, which reflect management’s opinions only as of the date hereof. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to any forward-looking statements.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Three and Six Months Ended December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (Amounts Expressed in United States Dollars, Except for Share and Per Share Data) 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS MedMen Enterprises Inc. and its subsidiaries over which the company has control (collectively, “MedMen”, the “Company”, “we” or “us”) is a premier cannabis retailer based in the U.S. with an operational footprint in California, Nevada, Illinois, Arizona, Massachusetts, and New York. MedMen offers a robust selection of high-quality products, including MedMen-owned brands – MedMen Red and LuxLyte – through its premium retail stores, proprietary delivery service, as well as curbside and in-store pick up. MedMen Buds provides exclusive access to promotions, product drops and content. As of December 24, 2022, the Company operates
23
store locations across California (13), Nevada (3), Illinois (1), Arizona (1), Massachusetts (1), and New York (4). The Company continues to market its assets in New York and thus classifies all assets and liabilities and profit or loss allocable to its operations in the state of New York as discontinued operations. In August 2022, the Company completed the sale of its operations in the state of Florida of which all assets and liabilities and profit or loss allocable to Florida were classified as discontinued operations until the day of sale, on August 22, 2022. Subsequent to August 22, 2022, the remaining post-acquisition assets and liabilities, which is primarily comprised of a current receivable for the portion of the sales proceeds due to us in March 2023, and profit or loss allocable to Florida have been reclassified as continuing operations. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Preparation The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim financial information. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of MedMen Enterprises, its subsidiaries and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) where the Company is considered the primary beneficiary, if any, after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments in entities in which the Company has significant influence, but less than a controlling financial interest, are accounted for using the equity method. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position of the Company as of and for the interim periods presented have been included. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements. Accordingly, certain information, footnotes and disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted in accordance with SEC rules for interim financial information. The financial data presented herein should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 25, 2022, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 9, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”).
Going Concern
As of December 24, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $ 15,605,362
and working capital deficit of $ 137,433,003 . The Company has incurred net losses from continuing operations of
$ 15,086,276
and $ 39,426,853
for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022, respectively. The conditions described above raise substantial doubt with respect to the Company’s ability to meet its obligations for at least one year from the issuance of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and therefore, to continue as a going concern.
7 Table of
Contents The Company plans to continue to fund its operations through the implementation and expansion of its cost savings plan, and various strategic actions, including the successful negotiations of lower costs of occupancy with its master lease landlord and other landlords, divestiture of non-core assets including but not limited to the current asset group held for sale, New York, as well continuing its on-going revenue and vendor strategy of market expansion and retail revenue and gross margin growth. The Company also needs to obtain an extension or a refinancing of its debt-in-default with the secured senior lender. The annual operating plan for fiscal year 2023 estimates the Company will be able to manage ongoing operations. However, its cash needs are significant and not achievable with the current cash flow from operations. If the above strategic actions, for any reason, are inaccessible, it will have a significantly negative effect on the Company’s financial condition. Additionally, management expects to continue to manage the Company’s operating expenses and reduce its projected cash requirements through reduction of its expenses by delaying new store development, permanently or temporarily closing stores that are deemed to be performing below expectations, and/or implementing other restructuring activities. Furthermore, COVID-19 and the impact the global pandemic on the broader retail environment could also have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, equity and or its access to capital and future financing. COVID-19 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities have enacted and implemented various recommendations and safety measures in an attempt to limit the spread and magnitude of the pandemic. The Company is continuously addressing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a discussion of which is available in Item 1A “ Risk Factors ” of the 2022 Form 10-K. The company’s operating results continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall impact on our business continues to depend on the length of time that the pandemic continues, the impact on consumer purchasing behavior, macro-economic factors such as inflation, and the extent to which it affects our ability to raise capital, and the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic, which all remain uncertain at this time. The Company will continue to implement and evaluate actions to strengthen our financial position and support the continuity of our business and operations. Basis of Consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company either has a controlling voting interest or is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. With the exception of MME Florida, LLC, which the Company disposed on August 22, 2022, the list of the Company’s subsidiaries included in the Company’s 2022 Form 10-K remain complete as of December 24, 2022.
Significant Accounting Policies The significant accounting policies and critical estimates applied by the Company in these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are the same as those applied in the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s 2022 Form 10-K, unless otherwise disclosed in these accompanying notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the interim period ended December 24, 2022. Earnings (Loss) per Share The Company calculates basic loss per share by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares, which comprise convertible debentures, restricted stock units, warrants and stock options issued. Reclassifications Certain amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 25, 2022 have non-material corrections and reclassified in order to conform to the current reporting period presentation.
In the Note related to Property and Equipment, the Company reclassified $ 940,000
to increase leasehold improvements and decrease furniture and fixtures. In the Note related to Intangibles, the Company reclassified $ 1,440,000
and $ 964,000
to decrease customer relationships and management agreements, along with the related accumulated amortization. 8 Table of
Contents In the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Company reclassified $ 3,662,000
between non-controlling interest and accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company reclassified $ 6,825,000
to decrease its short-term operating lease liabilities and increase its long-term operating lease liabilities.
There was no change to total current assets, total assets, total liabilities, total shareholders’ equity or cash flows as a result of these reclassifications and non-material corrections.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The Company has a stock and equity incentive plan (the “Incentive Plan”) under which the Company may issue various types of equity instruments to any employee, officer, consultant, advisor or director. The types of equity instruments issuable under the Incentive Plan encompass, among other things, stock options, stock grants, and restricted stock units (together, “Awards”). Stock based compensation expenses are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses. The maximum number of Awards that may be issued under the Incentive Plan shall be determined by the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors in the absence of a Compensation Committee. Any shares subject to an Award under the Incentive Plan that are forfeited, cancelled, expire unexercised, are settled in cash or are used or withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations, shall again be available for Awards under the Incentive Plan. Vesting of Awards will be determined by the Compensation Committee or Board of Directors in absence of a Compensation Committee. The exercise price for Awards (if applicable) will generally not be less than the fair market value of the Award at the time of grant and will generally expire after
5
or
10
years. 18 Table of

three and six months ended December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021 Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 24, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 24, 2022 December 25, 2021 Loss from Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes $ ( 14,025,468 ) $ ( 16,355,274 ) $ ( 32,673,967 ) $ ( 42,826,906 ) Provision for Income Tax Expense ( 1,060,808 ) 8,137,898   ( 6,752,886 ) ( 11,554,010 ) Effective Tax Rate 8   % - 50   % 21   % 27   % We have historically calculated the provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate (“AETR”) for the full fiscal year to “ordinary” income or loss (pre-tax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the reporting period. For the three and
six months ended December 25, 2021 ,
we determined we could no longer reliably estimate income taxes utilizing an AETR. The AETR estimate is highly sensitive to estimates of ordinary income (loss) and permanent differences such that minor fluctuations in these estimates could result in significant fluctuations of the Company’s AETR. Accordingly, we used our actual year-to-date effective tax rate to calculate income taxes for the
three and six months ended December 24, 2022 . As the Company operates in the legal cannabis industry, the Company is subject to the limits of IRC Section 280E for U.S. federal, Illinois state, Massachusetts state and New York state income tax purposes under which the Company is only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to sales of product. This results in permanent differences between ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-allowable under IRC Section 280E. However, the State of California does not conform to IRC Section 280E and, accordingly, the Company deducts all operating expenses on its California Franchise Tax Returns. The Company has approximately gross $ 12,230,000
(tax effected $ 3,240,000 ) of Canadian non-capital losses and $ 6,000,000
(tax effected $ 1,620,000 ) of share issuance cost 20(1)(e) balance. The loss tax attribute has been determined to be more likely than not that the tax attribute would not yield any tax benefit. As such, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the benefit. Since IRC Section 280E was not applied in the California Franchise Tax Returns, the Company has approximately $ 22,000,000
of gross California net operating losses which begin expiring in 2033 as of June 25, 2022. The Company has evaluated the realization of its California net operating loss tax attribute and has determined under the more likely than not standard that $ 217,300,000
will not be realized. The effective tax rate for the
three and six months ended December 24, 2022
is different from the three months ended September 25, 2021, respectively, primarily due to the Company’s income and related 280E expenditures. The Company’s non-deductible expenses related to IRC Section 280E limitations have remained relatively consistent. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions, and in Canada. The Company is generally subject to audit by taxing authorities in various U.S., state, and in foreign jurisdictions for fiscal years 2014 through the current fiscal year. As of December 24, 2022, the Company had $ 18,781,424
of unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would reduce income tax expense and the effective tax rate if recognized. During the three and six months ended December 24, 2022, the Company recognized a net discrete tax expense of $ 407,993
primarily related on interest of past liabilities. During the next twelve months, the Company does not estimate any material reduction in its unrecognized tax benefits. 18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Contingencies The Company’s operations are subject to a variety of local and state regulations. Failure to comply with one or more of these regulations could result in fines, restrictions on its operations, or losses of permits that could result in the Company ceasing operations. While management of the Company believes that the Company is in compliance with applicable local
22 Table of
Contents and state regulations as of December 24, 2022 and June 25, 2022, marijuana regulations continue to evolve and are subject to differing interpretations. As a result, the Company may be subject to regulatory fines, penalties or restrictions in the future. Claims and Litigation From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of business. The Company recognizes legal settlement expense when litigation losses related to pending or threatening lawsuits could be reasonably assessed to have resulted in a probable loss to the Company in an amount that can be reasonably estimated. The Company recognizes legal settlement gains when a favorable settlement is awarded to the Company and payment is received. Gain and losses related to claims and litigation are recorded as a component of Other Operating (Income) Expense in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 24, 2022, there are also no proceedings in which any of the Company’s current directors, officers or affiliates is an adverse party to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company’s interest. In March 2020, litigation was filed against the Company in the Superior Court of Arizona, Maricopa County, related to a purchase agreement for a previous acquisition. The Superior Court of Arizona, Maricopa County granted summary judgement in favor of the Company on all counts in July 2022. The Company is currently in process of recovering certain fees and costs associated with the lawsuit from the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs have filed an appeal of the summary judgment decision. The Company believes the likelihood of a loss contingency is neither probable nor estimable. As such, no amount has been accrued in these financial statements. In April 2020, a complaint was filed against the Company in Los Angeles Superior Court related to a contemplated acquisition in which the plaintiffs are seeking damages for alleged breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing seeking declaratory relief and specific performance. The Company filed counterclaims including for breach of contract, breach of promissory note, unjust enrichment and declaratory relief. After the end of the quarter ending December 24, 2022, the parties reached a tentative agreement to resolve the litigation; however, the probable loss to the Company cannot be reasonably estimated. As such, no amount has been accrued in these financial statements. In November 2020, entities affiliated with former officers of the Company initiated arbitration against a subsidiary of the Company in Los Angeles, California asserting breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, and unjust enrichment. The claimants are generally seeking damages and compensatory damages according to proof, including lost earnings and other benefits, past and future, interest on lost earnings and benefits, reasonable attorney’s fees, and such other and further relief as the court deems proper. The Company asserted counterclaims, including for breach of the same management agreements. The arbitration hearing has been rescheduled and the matter is being disputed. The litigation remains at an early stage and the likelihood of a loss contingency is remote. As such, no amount has been accrued in these financial statements. In October 2021, a suit for premises liability and negligence seeking unspecified damages for pain and suffering, disability, mental and emotional distress, and loss of earnings was filed against the Company in Los Angeles Superior Court. The matter is in the process of being litigated. The Company believes the likelihood of loss is remote. As such, no amount has been accrued in these financial statements. In July 2022, a complaint was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Baker & McKenzie LLP, a former law firm to the Company, seeking in excess of $ 600,000
in legal fees plus accrued interest. The Company has filed a counterclaim against Baker & McKenzie claiming overbilling on total invoices propounded by the law firm to the Company exceeding $ 18,500,000 . The litigation remains at an early stage and the likelihood of a loss contingency is remote. As such, no amount has been accrued in these financial statements The Company is the defendant in several complaints filed by various of its landlords seeking rents and damages under lease arrangements. First, in 2020 a complaint was filed in Cook County Circuit Court, Illinois against the Company by a landlord claiming the Company had failed to meet its obligations to apply effort to obtain a retail cannabis license at a property, for which the landlord is seeking rents and damages. Plaintiff has filed a motion for summary judgment which remains pending. If the litigation is not settled or resolved, trial will likely take place during the fiscal year ended 2023 or possibly the fiscal year ended 2024. This matter is preliminary and the Company believes the likelihood of loss is remote.
As such, no amount has been accrued in these financial statements. Second, in July 2022, a complaint was filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by a landlord seeking damages under a lease on real estate located in Illinois. The Company filed an answer to the complaint arguing that the subject matter of the
23 Table of
Contents case was not appropriate for determination by a federal court in New York. The court thereafter permitted the action to be dismissed without prejudice, after which the plaintiff refiled the case in California against the Company as guarantor of the lease. The matter is in the process of being litigated in the Los Angeles Superior Court. The Company believes the likelihood of loss is remote. As such, no amount has been accrued in these financial statements. Third, in June 2022, a complaint was filed against the Company by the Company’s landlord at its cultivation center in Utica, New York, related to an agreement to purchase land next to the cultivation center, which land was also owned by the landlord. Plaintiff sought to enforce a land purchase agreement and is seeking damages. The Company settled this dispute during the quarter ending December 24, 2022 in the amount of $ 350,000 . In April 2022, the landlord at the Company’s dispensary location in Tampa, Florida, filed suit seeking damages under a lease, shortly after which the Company announced its plans to sell its Florida operations. The Company retained this lease and the associated litigation following the sale of its Florida operations. The litigation is at an early stage and the likelihood of a loss contingency is remote. As such, no amount has been accrued in these financial statements. 19. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company’s Board of Directors each receive quarterly fees of $ 200,000
of which one-third is paid in cash and two-thirds is paid in Class B Subordinate Voting Shares. 20. SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company currently operates in
one
segment, the production and sale of cannabis products, which is how the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker manages the business and makes operating decisions. The Company’s cultivation operations are not considered significant to the overall operations of the Company. Intercompany sales and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 21.

Contents ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) of the financial condition and results of operations of MedMen Enterprises Inc. (“MedMen Enterprises”, “MedMen”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”) is for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes presented in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and those discussed in Item 8 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”) filed with the SEC on September 9, 2022. Except for historical information, the discussion in this section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Future results could differ materially from those discussed below for many reasons, including the risks described in “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. We are a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we have omitted certain information called for by this Item as permitted by applicable scaled disclosure rules. All references to “$” and “dollars” refer to U.S. dollars. References to C$ refer to Canadian dollars. Certain totals, subtotals and percentages throughout this MD&A may not reconcile due to rounding. Our fiscal year is a 52/53-week year ending on the last Saturday in June or first Saturday in July. For the current interim period, the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021 refer to the 13 weeks ended therein.
Overview MedMen is a cannabis retailer based in the U.S. offering a robust selection of high-quality products, including MedMen-owned brands, LuxLyte, and MedMen Red through its premium retail stores, proprietary delivery service, as well as curbside and in-store pick up. As of December 24, 2022 the Company operates 23 store locations across California (13), Nevada (3), Illinois (1), Arizona (1), Massachusetts (1), and New York (4). On August 22, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its operations in the state of Florida, including its license, dispensaries, inventory and cultivation operations, to Green Sentry Holdings, LLC (“ Buyer ”) at the final sales price of $67.0 million which comprised of $63.0 million in cash and $4.0 million in liabilities assumed by the Buyer. The Buyer made a cash payment of $40.0 million at closing, a cash payment of $11.5 million on September 15, 2022, and is required to make one additional installment payments of $11.5 million on or before March 15, 2023. As of December 24, 2022, net proceeds to the Company were $19.5 million after $31.6 million of the cash proceeds was used to repay the Senior Secured Term Loans with Hankey Capital. Proceeds of the transaction to the Company are used to fund operations and pay interest to Hankey Capital while the Senior Secured Term Loans remain outstanding and in default. In addition, the Company licensed the tradename “MedMen” to the Buyer for use in Florida for a period of two years, subject to termination rights, for a quarterly revenue-based fee. Proceeds from the licensure of the trade name have been minimal. All purchased assets and assumed liabilities related to Florida are excluded from our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 24, 2022 and all profits or losses from our Florida operations subsequent to August 22, 2022 are included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to “ Note 22 – Discontinued Operations ” of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further information.
Other developments during second quarter of 2022 included:
The launch of MOSS™, our own private label brand of cannabis products from our own cultivation facility in Mesa for sale in Arizona. The first shipments of Moss™ landed in our stores in late December.
We began construction of our second store in Illinois expecting to be complete in the Spring of 2023. The store is located in 15 miles northwest of Chicago and in similar proximity to our existing store in Oak Park, IL, in a dense suburban area near restaurants, coffee shops and parks.
We completed vendor-agreements in California with key brands in California which will allow us to secure optimal product assortment and pricing. 28 Table of
Contents COVID-19 Pandemic We continuously address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a discussion of which is available in Item 1A “ Risk Factors ” of the 2022 Form 10-K. Our business and operating results for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022, continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall impact on our business continues to depend on the length of time that the pandemic continues, the impact on consumer purchasing behavior, macro-economic factors such as inflation, and the extent to which it affects our ability to raise capital, and the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic, which all remain uncertain at this time. We continue to implement and evaluate actions to strengthen our financial position and support the continuity of our business and operations. Financial Condition and Going Concern As of December 24, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $15.6 million and working capital deficit of $137.4 million. The Company has incurred net losses from continuing operations of $15.1 million compared to $8.2 million for the six months ended December 24, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. The conditions described above raise substantial doubt with respect to the Company’s ability to meet its obligations for at least one year from the issuance of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and therefore, to continue as a going concern. The Company plans to continue to fund its operations through the implementation and expansion of its cost savings plan, and various strategic actions, including the successful negotiations of lower costs of occupancy with our master lease landlord and other landlords, divestiture of non-core assets including but not limited to the current asset group held for sale, New York, as well continuing its on-going revenue and vendor strategy of market expansion and retail revenue and gross margin growth. We also need to obtain an extension or a refinancing of our debt-in-default with the secured senior lender. Our annual operating plan for fiscal year 2023 estimates we will be able to manage our ongoing operations. However, our cash needs are significant and not achievable with the current cash flow from operations. If the above strategic actions, for any reason, are inaccessible, it will have a significantly negative effect on the Company’s financial condition. Additionally, we expect to continue to manage the Company’s operating expenses and reduce its projected cash requirements through reduction of its expenses by delaying new store development, permanently or temporarily closing stores that are deemed to be performing below expectations, and/or implementing other restructuring activities. Furthermore, COVID-19 and the impact the global pandemic on the broader retail environment could also have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, equity and or its access to capital and future financing. As of December 24, 2022, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going concern. The following table summarizes certain aspects of the Company’s financial condition as of December 24, 2022 and June 25, 2022: ($ in Millions) December 24, 2022 June 25, 2022 $ Change

The Buyer made a cash payment of $40,000,000 at closing, $11,500,000 on September 15, 2023, and is required to make an additional installment payment of $11,500,000 on or before March 15, 2023. During the fiscal third quarter of 2022, net proceeds to
29 Table of
Contents the Company were $19,558,947 after a principal repayment of $31,599,999 on the Senior Secured Term Loans with Hankey Capital. The final cash payment of $11,500,000 remains due and receivable as of December 24, 2022. The Senior Secured Term Loans remains outstanding and in default as of December 24, 2022. The $20.7 million improvement in working capital deficit was primarily related to the $31.6 million principal repayment on the Senior Secured Term Loans that matured on July 31, 2022 and August 1, 2022. The Company’s working capital will be significantly impacted by continued operations and growth in retail operations and the continued stewardship of the Company’s financial resources. The ability to fund working capital needs will also be dependent on the Company’s ability to raise additional debt and equity financing and execute cost savings plans. 30 Table of

Revenue for the six months ended December 24, 2022 was $59.6 million, a decrease of $12.7 million, or 18%, compared to revenue of $72.3 million for the six months ended December 25, 2021.

In California, revenue for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 experienced a decline of $3.8 million or 16% and $8.5 million or 18%, respectively, over the same prior year period. The change is primarily driven by lower basket size, inconsistent and / or lower traffic to the stores which was slightly partially offset by flat conversion rates. We believe we were also affected by the status of the cannabis supply in this State. California continues to deal with high levels of cannabis production, which we believe has flooded the legal and illegal market with quality cannabis flower increasing competition and decreasing market share. In addition, the increase in new dispensaries within key markets, more aggressive promotional cadence by all dispensaries, including ours, has resulted in a saturated market wherein the California cannabis consumer has an increased number of choices for cannabis products at discounted pricing. During the quarter, we continued to increase our focus on product portfolio and product selection, expanding vendor relationships, engaging in allowable marketing strategies and continued efforts to develop our private label products.
In Nevada, revenue for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 experienced a decline of $1.0 million or 27% and $2.1 million or 27%, respectively, over the same prior year period. We experienced a decline in basket size as well as traffic and conversion rates. Nevada noted an overall decline in legal cannabis sales primarily related to a maturing industry, lower disposable income and a revenue base heavily reliant on tourism. In Illinois, revenue for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 experienced a decline of $1.0 million or 25% and $1.8 million or 21%, respectively, over the same prior year period. We continue to face market pressure from additional licenses issued by surrounding municipalities as part of Illinois’ efforts to promote equality and accessible locations for the consumer. We have made great efforts in testing new promotional messaging that, if marketed properly, can increase foot traffic and revenue. We have plans to open a second store in Illinois in the Spring of 2023 located 15 miles northwest of Chicago and within similar proximity to our existing store in Oak Park, in a dense suburban area near restaurants, coffee shops and parks.
In Arizona, revenue for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 experienced a decline of $0.8 million or 20% and $1.7 million or 22% respectively over the same prior year period. This decrease resulted from a decline in medical-use sales because of a maturing recreational cannabis industry. Arizona is also experiencing an increase in new dispensary openings, that similar to California, has resulted in a saturated market. Exacerbating the increase in dispensary openings, is the increase in aggressive promotional cadences by these dispensaries. We continue our efforts to finding the optimal product selection that can meet the demands of both medical and recreational customers including the launch of our private label products, Moss™, from our own cultivation facility in Mesa. The first shipments of Moss™ landed in our stores in late December.
32 Table of
Contents In Massachusetts, revenue for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 experienced an increase of $0.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Our store near Fenway Park opened December 2021 with no comparable sales for this reporting period. During our first fiscal quarter, we completed the sale of our Florida-based assets. We continue to hold for sale our New York-based assets which are presented as discontinued operations. Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit Cost of goods sold for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 was $14.5 million and $29.6 million compared to $17.6 million and $37.0 million for the three and six months ended December 25, 2021 respectively, with a decrease of $3.1 million, or 18% and $7.4 million or 20% respectively.
Gross profit for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 was $15.1 million and $30.0 million compared to $17.9 million and $35.3 million for the three and six months ended December 25, 2021 respectively, with a decrease of $2.8 million, or 16% and $5.3 million or 15%, respectively. Gross margin for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 was 51% and 50%, respectively, compared to gross margin of 50% and 49% for the three and six months ended December 25, 2021 respectively. The improvement in gross margin resulted from our continuous efforts to develop vendor programs that reduced our cost of goods sold, as well as our success in lowering costs of production at our cultivation centers. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 was $21.8 million and $43.2 million compared to $39.0 million and $80.7 million for the three and
six months ended December 25, 2021 respectively, with a decrease of $17.2 million, or 44% and $37.5 million or 46% respectively. These changes were primarily attributable to our efforts and focus on our cost management strategy as well as the factors discussed below. General and administrative expenses (“G&A”) for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 was $18.3 million and $36.5 million compared to $31.3 million and $63.9 million for the three and six months ended December 25, 2021 respectively, with a decrease of $13.0 million, or 41% and $27.5 million or 43% respectively. Key drivers of the decrease in G&A for the three months ended December 24, 2022 include reductions in rent expense of $1.7 million, salaries of $3.5 million, professional fees of $5.7 million, deal costs of $1.2 million and other general expenses of $2.9 million, partially offset by an increase in share-based compensation of $1.4 million. Management continues to focus on reducing company-wide G&A. We expect G&A will continue to decrease in fiscal year 2023 as compared to prior year. Sales and marketing expenses for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 was $0.6 million and $1.0 million compared to $1.0 million and $1.6 million for the three and six months ended December 25, 2021 respectively, with a decrease of $0.5 million, or 45% and $0.6 million or 38% respectively. Depreciation and amortization for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 was $3.5 million and $7.4 million compared to $6.4 million and $12.2 million for three and six months ended December 25, 2021 respectively, with a decrease of $2.9 million, or 45% and $4.8 million or 39% respectively. The overall decrease is attributable a lower carrying basis of our long-lived assets as a result of the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a delay in new capital projects. We are currently evaluating the long-term benefits of continuing to pursue the build out of some of our locations that are not yet opened or constructed. We are in negotiations with the landlords of our unfinished locations in California and Massachusetts in an effort to reach the best outcome for all parties including the communities that live and work near these unfinished locations possibly deterring from market values. Impairment expense for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 was $5.1 million and $6.7 million compared to nil and $0.4 million for the three and six months ended December 25, 2021 respectively, with an increase of $5.1 million and $6.3 million, or nil and 1443%, respectively.
Other operating (income) expense for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 was other operating income of $5.6 million and $7.5 million compared to other operating expense of $0.6 million and $2.8 million for the three and six months ended December 25, 2021 respectively, with a decrease in other operating expense of $6.3 million, or 993% and $10.4 million or 367% respectively. The decrease in other operating expense of $6.3 million for the three months ended December 24, 2022 was primarily due to a $2.1 million increase in gain on lease terminations, a net $3.5 million gain on legal settlements and recognition of $1.5 million in sublease income, partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in loss on
33 Table of
Contents disposals of assets. The decrease in other operating expense of $10.4 million for the six months ended December 24, 2022 was primarily due to the net $3.5 million gain on legal settlements, recognition of $3.0 million in sublease income, a $3.6 million increase in gain on lease terminations, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in restructuring and reorganization expenses and a $1.5 million increase in loss on disposals of assets.
Non-Operating Expense Non-operating expense for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 was $7.3 million and $19.5 million compared to non-operating income of $4.8 million and $2.6 million for the three and six months ended December 25, 2021 respectively, with an increase of $12.1 million, or 253% and $22.1 million or 845% respectively. The increase in non-operating expense for the three months ended December 24, 2022 was primarily due a $10.2 million devaluation in the fair value of our derivatives. The increase in non-operating expense for the six months ended December 24, 2022 was primarily due to a $13.1 million devaluation in the fair value of our derivatives coupled with a decrease in gain on extinguishment of debt of $10.2 million and increase in interest expense of $3.5 million, partially offset by a decrease of $4.7 million in the accretion of our debt discount and loan origination fees.
Provision for Income Taxes MedMen is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates and, consequently, income tax expense is a function of the allocation of taxable income by jurisdiction and the various activities that impact the timing of taxable events. As we operate in the legal cannabis industry, we are subject to the limits of Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 280E under which we are only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to sales of product. This results in permanent differences between ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-allowable under IRC Section 280E and a higher effective tax rate than most industries. However, California does not conform to IRC Section 280E and, accordingly, we deduct all operating expenses on MedMen’s California Franchise Tax Returns. The provision for income taxes for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 was $(1.1) million and $(6.8) million compared to $8.1 million and $(11.6) million for the three and six months ended December 25, 2021 respectively, with a decrease of $9.2 million, or 113% and $4.8 million or 42% respectively. The change is primarily due to the Company’s forecasted income and related IRC Section 280E expenditures. Net Loss Net loss from continuing operations for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 was $15.1 million and $39.4 million compared to $8.2 million and $54.4 million for three and six months ended December 25, 2021 respectively. For the three and six months ended December 24, 2022, net loss from continuing operations was favorably impacted by the Company’s continued efforts to optimize selling, general and administrative costs and right-size the Company’s corporate infrastructure. Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA from Continuing Operations and Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations are financial measures that are not defined under GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss), or “earnings”, before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before: (i) transaction costs and restructuring costs; (ii) non-cash share-based compensation expense; (iii) fair value changes in derivative liabilities and contingent consideration; (iv) (gains) losses on disposal of assets, assets held for sale, extinguishment of debt and lease terminations; and (v) other one-time charges for non-cash operating costs. These financial measures are metrics that have been adjusted from the GAAP net income (loss) measure in an effort to provide readers with a normalized metric in making comparisons more meaningful across the cannabis industry, as well as to remove non-recurring, irregular and one-time items that may otherwise distort the GAAP net income measure. Other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 34 Table of

The prior year amount of $1.3 million for the three months ended December 25, 2021 and $7.6 million for the six months ended December 25, 2021 have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. Accretion of debt discount was previously excluded from the reconciliation of Net Loss to EBITDA from Continuing Operations and Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations. EBITDA from Continuing Operations represents the Company’s current operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow and includes significant non-cash operating costs. Considering these adjustments, the Company had EBITDA from Continuing Operations for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 of $0.8 million and $(2.5) million compared to $(0.1) million and $(5.8) million for the three and six months ended December 25, 2021 respectively, with an increase of $0.9 million, or 900% and $3.3 million or 57% respectively. The improvement in EBITDA from Continuing Operations was primarily due to the Company’s continued cost-saving strategies, lower operating costs at the cultivation facility in
Arizona and elimination of high operating costs from the licensing and management agreement with an unrelated third party now operating the previously owned cultivation centers in California and Nevada, which includes lower rents.
Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations for the three and six months ended December 24, 2022 was $0.1 million and $0.2 million compared to $(11.9) million and $(14.1) million for the three and six months ended December 25, 2021 respectively. The improvement is primarily due to the decrease in general and administrative expenses. The financial performance of the Company is expected to further improve as the Company works towards profitability and coupled with significant deleveraging of its balance sheet, will reposition the Company for growth. 35 Table of

The decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in general and administrative expenses as described in “ Results of Operations ” above. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended December 24, 2022 was $45.5 million compared to $7.6 million net cash used in investing activities six months ended December 25, 2021. This was primarily due to the $51.5 million in cash proceeds from the sale of the Company’s operations in the state of Florida during the current period. Cash Flow from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended December 24, 2022 was $32.4 million compared to $93.2 million net cash provided by financing activities for six months ended December 25, 2021. During the current period, the Company used $31.6 million of the cash proceeds from the sale of its Florida-based operations to make principal repayments on the Senior Secured Term Loan. Whereas during the comparative prior period, the Company completed a private placement with Serruya Private Equity Inc. (“SPE”) resulting in an equity investment of $100.0 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of the business, including operationalizing existing licenses, capital expenditures, debt service and acquisitions. The primary source of liquidity has primarily been private and/or public financing and to a lesser extent by cash generated from sales. The ability to fund operations, to make planned capital expenditures, to execute on the growth/acquisition strategy, to make scheduled debt and rent payments and to repay or refinance indebtedness depends on the Company’s future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond its control. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations associated with financial liabilities. The Company manages liquidity risk through the management of its capital structure.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no material undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on its results of operations, financial condition, revenues or expenses, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Information not required to be filed by smaller reporting companies. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15-d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), as of December 24, 2022, the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. The term “disclosure controls and procedures”, as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including
37 Table of
Contents its principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation and the identification of the material weakness described herein, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of the end of our last fiscal year end, June 25, 2022, and continues as such as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
For fiscal year 2022, management identified a material weakness determining that the Company’s financial recordkeeping process was deficient and that it does not have effective controls over the period-end reconciliation process. The reconciliation process was not being performed in a manner that will detect and correct errors on a timely basis, including: • general ledgers are not being reviewed regularly for assets that may not be recoverable or viable, • review procedures for balance sheet account reconciliations and manual journal entries were not performed, and • some accounts and balances are not being reconciled regularly, and/or account reconciliations that are being completed do not properly address or adjust reconciling items. Management plans to implement measures designed to improve its internal control over financial reporting to remediate material weaknesses described above by standardizing the monthly reconciliation process for material accounts and balances with formalized procedures. Material non-standard journal entries recorded in the accounting system will be reviewed for the various applicable accounting assertions including recoverability and validity. While the Company is actively engaged in the implementation of its remediation efforts to address this internal control weakness, the actions we have taken are subject to continued review, supported by confirmation and testing by management. Accordingly, the material weakness will not be considered fully remediated until the new control procedures are implemented for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded that these controls are operating effectively which we anticipate will occur in the ensuing months. Except as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 24, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements attributable to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Assessments of any evaluation of controls’ effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements as a result of error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 38 Table of
