Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in thousands, except per share amounts) (unaudited) 1.  Description of Business Phibro Animal Health Corporation (“Phibro” or “PAHC”) and its subsidiaries (together, the “Company”) is a diversified global developer, manufacturer, and marketer of a broad range of animal health and mineral nutrition products for food and companion animals including poultry, swine, beef and dairy cattle, aquaculture and dogs. The Company is also a manufacturer and marketer of performance products for use in the personal care, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. Unless otherwise indicated or the context requires otherwise, references in this report to “we,” “our,” “us,” and similar expressions refer to Phibro and its subsidiaries. The unaudited consolidated financial information for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, is presented on the same basis as the financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (the “Annual Report”), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 24, 2022 (File no. 001-36410). In the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the interim periods, and the adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. The financial results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The consolidated balance sheet information as of June 30, 2022 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The unaudited consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Phibro and its consolidated subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. The decision to consolidate an entity requires consideration of majority voting interests, as well as effective control over the entity. ​ ​ 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Standards Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report. As of December 31, 2022, there have been no material changes to any of the significant accounting policies contained therein. Net Income per Share and Weighted Average Shares Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period after giving effect to dilutive common share equivalents. There were no common share equivalents in the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.

We applied the optional expedients to treat the amendments as a continuation of existing contracts at the time the amendments were executed. ​ ​ 3.  Statements of Operations—Additional Information Disaggregated revenue, deferred revenue and customer payment terms We develop, manufacture and market a broad range of products for food and companion animals including poultry, swine, beef and dairy cattle, aquaculture, and dogs. The products help prevent, control and treat diseases and support nutrition to help improve animal health and well-being. The animal health and mineral nutrition products are sold directly to integrated poultry, cattle, and swine integrators and through commercial animal feed manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and veterinarians. The animal health industry and demand for many of the animal health products in a particular region are affected by changing disease pressures and by weather conditions, as product usage follows varying weather patterns and seasons. Our operations are primarily focused on regions where the majority of livestock production is consolidated in large commercial farms. We have a diversified portfolio of products that are classified within our
three
business segments—Animal Health, Mineral Nutrition and Performance Products. Each segment has its own dedicated management and sales team. Animal Health The Animal Health business develops, manufactures and markets products in three main categories: ● MFAs and other: MFAs and other products primarily consist of concentrated medicated products that are administered through animal feeds, commonly referred to as Medicated Feed Additives (“MFAs”). Specific product classifications include antibacterials, which inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria that cause bacterial infections in animals; anticoccidials, which inhibit the growth of coccidia (parasites) that damage the intestinal tract of animals; and other related products. The MFAs and other category also includes other antibacterial products and processing aids used in the ethanol fermentation industry. ● Nutritional specialties: Nutritional specialty products enhance nutrition to help improve health and performance in areas such as immune system function and digestive health.
We are also a developer, manufacturer and marketer of microbial products and bioproducts for a variety of applications serving animal health and nutrition, environmental, industrial and agricultural customers. ● Vaccines:  Vaccine products are primarily focused on preventing diseases in poultry and swine. They protect animals from either viral or bacterial disease challenges. We develop, manufacture and market conventionally licensed and
9
Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) autogenous vaccine products, as well as adjuvants, for animal vaccine manufacturers. We have also developed and market an innovative and proprietary delivery platform for vaccines. Mineral Nutrition The Mineral Nutrition business is comprised of formulations and concentrations of trace minerals such as zinc, manganese, copper, iron and other compounds, with a focus on customers in North America. Our customers use these products to fortify the daily feed requirements of their livestock’s diets and maintain an optimal balance of trace elements in each animal. We manufacture and market a broad range of mineral nutrition products for food animals including poultry, swine, and beef and dairy cattle. Performance Products The Performance Products business manufactures and markets specialty ingredients for use in the personal care, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries.

of the total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, respectively. The deferred revenue resulted primarily from certain customer arrangements, including technology licensing fees and discounts on future product sales. The transaction price associated with our deferred revenue arrangements is generally based on the stand-alone sales prices of the individual products or services. Our customer payment terms generally range from
30
to
120 days
globally and exclude any significant financing components. Payment terms vary based on industry and business practices within the regions in which we operate. Our average worldwide collection period for accounts receivable is approximately

(the “2021 Term A Loan”) and a revolving credit facility under which we could borrow up to an aggregate amount of $ 250,000 , subject to the terms of the 2021 Credit Agreement (the “2021 Revolver” and together with the 2021 Term A Loan, the “2021 Credit Facilities”). In November 2022, we amended the 2021 Credit Facilities to increase the revolving commitments under the 2021 Revolver to an aggregate amount of $ 310,000
and adopt SOFR as the reference for the fluctuating rate of interest on the 2021 Credit Facilities, replacing the LIBOR reference rate. All other terms and conditions of the 2021 Credit Agreement were unchanged. The 2021 Term A Loan is repayable in quarterly installments, with the balance payable at maturity. The 2021 Revolver contains a letter of credit facility. The interest rate per annum applicable to the loans under the 2021 Credit Facilities is based on a fluctuating rate of interest plus an applicable rate equal to
2.00 %,
1.75 % or
1.50 % in the case of adjusted SOFR rate loans and
1.00 %,
0.75 % or
0.50 % in the case of base rate loans. The applicable rates are based on the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement). The 2021 Credit Facilities mature in
April 2026 . 12
Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) The 2021 Credit Agreement requires, among other things, compliance with financial covenants that permit: (i) a maximum First Lien Net Leverage Ratio of
4.00 :1.00 and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of
3.00 :1.00, each calculated on a trailing four-quarter basis. The 2021 Credit Agreement contains an acceleration clause should an event of default (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement) occur. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the financial covenants. As of December 31, 2022, we had $ 184,000
in borrowings drawn under the 2021 Revolver and had outstanding letters of credit of $ 2,479 , leaving $ 123,521
available for further borrowings and letters of credit under the 2021 Revolver, subject to restrictions in our 2021 Credit Facilities. We obtain letters of credit in connection with certain regulatory and insurance obligations, inventory purchases and other contractual obligations. The terms of these letters of credit are all less than
one year . In July 2017, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on $ 150,000
of notional principal that effectively converted the floating LIBOR portion of our interest obligation on that amount of debt to a fixed interest rate of
1.83 %. The agreement matured in
June 2022 . We designated the interest rate swap as a highly effective cash flow hedge. For additional details, see “Note 8 — Derivatives.”
In March 2020, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on $ 150,000
of notional principal that effectively converted the floating LIBOR portion of our interest obligation on that amount of debt to a fixed rate of
0.62 %. In July 2022, this agreement increased to a notional principal amount of $ 300,000 . In November 2022, we amended the March 2020 interest rate swap agreement to convert the floating portion of our interest obligation to SOFR. The agreement effectively converts the floating portion of our interest obligation on $ 300,000
of debt to a fixed interest rate of
0.61 % through
June 2025 . We have designated the interest rate swap as a highly effective cash flow hedge. For additional details, see “Note 8 — Derivatives.” As of December 31, 2022, the interest rates for the 2021 Revolver and the 2021 Term A Loan were
5.76 % and
2.36 %, respectively. The weighted-average interest rates for the 2021 Revolver were
4.57 % and
1.83 % for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The weighted-average interest rates for the 2021 Term A Loan were
2.37 % and
2.98 % for six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Other Long-Term Debt ​ In September 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the “2022 Term Loan”) in the amount of $ 12,000 , collateralized by certain facilities. The 2022 Term Loan matures in September 2027. The interest rate per annum applicable to the 2022 Term Loan is based on a fluctuating rate of interest, at the Company’s election from time to time, equal to either (i) one-month Adjusted SOFR plus
1.00 %, or (ii) a base rate determined by reference to the greater of (a) the prime rate and (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus
0.50 %. The 2022 Term Loan is repayable in
monthly
installments of $ 35 , with the balance payable at maturity. The weighted-average interest rate was
5.74 % for the period during which the 2022 Term Loan was outstanding during the six months ended December 31, 2022.

Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) 6.  Related Party Transactions Certain relatives of Jack C. Bendheim, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, provided services to the Company as employees or consultants and received aggregate compensation and benefits of approximately $ 397
and $ 471
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and $ 1,177
and $ 1,300
during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Mr. Bendheim has sole authority to vote shares of our stock owned by BFI Co., LLC, an investment vehicle of the Bendheim family. 7.  Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Our operations and properties are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those governing pollution; protection of the environment; the use, management, and release of hazardous materials, substances and wastes; air emissions; greenhouse gas emissions; water use, supply and discharges; the investigation and remediation of contamination; the manufacture, distribution, and sale of regulated materials, including pesticides; the importing, exporting and transportation of products; and the health and safety of our employees (collectively, “Environmental Laws”). As such, the nature of our current and former operations exposes us to the risk of claims with respect to such matters, including fines, penalties, and remediation obligations that may be imposed by regulatory authorities. Under certain circumstances, we might be required to curtail operations until a particular problem is remedied. Known costs and expenses under Environmental Laws incidental to ongoing operations, including the cost of litigation proceedings relating to environmental matters, are included within operating results. Potential costs and expenses may also be incurred in connection with the repair or upgrade of facilities to meet existing or new requirements under Environmental Laws or to investigate or remediate potential or actual contamination, and from time to time we establish reserves for such contemplated investigation and remediation costs. In many instances, the ultimate costs under Environmental Laws and the period during which such costs are likely to be incurred are difficult to predict. While we believe that our operations are currently in material compliance with Environmental Laws, we have, from time to time, received notices of violation from governmental authorities, and have been involved in civil or criminal action for such violations. Additionally, at various sites, our subsidiaries are engaged in continuing investigation, remediation and/or monitoring efforts to address contamination associated with historic operations of the sites. We devote considerable resources to complying with Environmental Laws and managing environmental liabilities. We have developed programs to identify requirements under, and maintain compliance with Environmental Laws; however, we cannot predict with certainty the effect of increased and more stringent regulation on our operations, future capital expenditure requirements, or the cost of compliance. The nature of our current and former operations exposes us to the risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and we cannot assure we will not incur material costs and liabilities in connection with such claims. Based on our experience, we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing Environmental Laws, and liabilities for known environmental claims pursuant to such Environmental Laws, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) is investigating and planning for the remediation of offsite contaminated groundwater that has migrated from the Omega Chemical Corporation Superfund Site (“Omega Chemical Site”), which is upgradient of the Santa Fe Springs, California facility of our subsidiary, Phibro-Tech, Inc. (“Phibro-Tech”). The EPA has entered into a settlement agreement with a group of companies that sent chemicals to the Omega Chemical Site for processing and recycling (“OPOG”) to remediate the contaminated groundwater that has migrated from the Omega Chemical Site in accordance with a general remedy selected by the EPA. The EPA has named Phibro-Tech and certain other subsidiaries of PAHC as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) due to groundwater contamination from Phibro-Tech’s Santa Fe Springs facility that has allegedly commingled with contaminated groundwater from the Omega Chemical Site. In September 2012, the EPA notified approximately
140
PRPs, including Phibro-Tech and the other subsidiaries, that they have been identified as potentially responsible for remedial action for the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site and for EPA oversight and response costs. Phibro-Tech contends that any groundwater contamination at its site is localized and due to historical operations that pre-date Phibro-Tech and/or contaminated groundwater that has migrated from upgradient properties. In addition, a successor to a prior owner of the Phibro-Tech site has asserted that PAHC and Phibro-Tech are obligated to provide indemnification for its potential liability and defense costs relating to the
14
Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site. PAHC and Phibro-Tech have vigorously contested this position and have asserted that the successor to the prior owner is required to indemnify Phibro-Tech for its potential liability and defense costs. In 2014, several members of OPOG filed a complaint under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against many of the PRPs allegedly associated with the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site (including Phibro-Tech) for contribution toward past and future costs associated with the investigation and remediation of the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site. In August 2022, the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), on behalf of the EPA, sent Phibro-Tech and certain other PRPs a pre-litigation notice letter regarding potential CERCLA Sec. 107 cost recovery claims seeking unrecovered past costs related to the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site, along with a declaration allocating liability for future costs.
In January 2023, the plaintiffs in the OPOG lawsuit, the EPA and certain defendants in the OPOG lawsuit, including Phibro-Tech, reached a tentative settlement that would provide for a “cash-out” settlement, with contribution protection, for Phibro-Tech and its affiliates (as well as certain other defendants) releasing Phibro-Tech and its affiliates from liability for contamination of the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site (with certain exceptions), including past and future EPA response costs that were the subject of the letter sent by the DOJ on behalf of the EPA in August 2022. As part of the tentative settlement, Phibro-Tech would also resolve all claims for indemnification and contribution between Phibro-Tech and the successor to the prior owner of the Phibro-Tech site.
The terms of the tentative settlement, which is subject to negotiation and court approval of a definitive settlement agreement, contemplate cash payments by Phibro-Tech and one of its affiliates, with the option for payments to be made in installments over several years with interest. In the three months ended December 31, 2022, we have recognized a reserve for the OPOG lawsuit representing the cash payments contemplated under the tentative settlement and other related costs, which is included in our consolidated statement of operations as selling, general and administrative expenses.
​ Based upon information available, to the extent such costs can be estimated with reasonable certainty, we estimated the cost for further investigation and remediation of identified soil and groundwater problems at operating sites, closed sites and third-party sites, and closure costs for closed sites, including the reserve for the OPOG lawsuit referred to in the preceding paragraph, to be approximately $ 10,480
and $ 4,287
at December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, respectively, which is included in current and long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. However, future events, such as new information, changes in existing Environmental Laws or their interpretation, and more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, may give rise to additional expenditures or liabilities that could be material. For all purposes of the discussion under this caption and elsewhere in this report, it should be noted that we take and have taken the position that neither PAHC nor any of our subsidiaries are liable for environmental or other claims made against one or more of our other subsidiaries or for which any of such other subsidiaries may ultimately be responsible. Claims and Litigation PAHC and its subsidiaries are party to various claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business including product liabilities, payment disputes and governmental regulation. Certain of these actions seek damages in various amounts. In many cases, such claims are covered by insurance. We believe that none of the claims or pending lawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity. ​ Development Agreements We have entered into various licensing agreements for the development, manufacture and commercialization of certain companion animal products. Under the agreements, we may be liable for future payments upon the achievement of certain development milestones and as a percentage of net sales. ​ 8.  Derivatives We monitor our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and from time-to-time use derivatives to manage certain of these risks. We designate derivatives as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of the cash flows to be received or paid in the future related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). All changes in the fair value of a highly effective cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 15
Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) We routinely assess whether the derivatives used to hedge transactions are effective. If we determine a derivative no longer is an effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting in the period of the assessment for that derivative, and immediately recognize any unrealized gains or losses related to the fair value of that derivative in the consolidated statements of operations. We record derivatives at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. For additional details regarding fair value, see “Note 9 — Fair Value Measurements.” In July 2017, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on the first $ 150,000
of notional principal that effectively converted the floating LIBOR portion of our interest obligation on that amount of debt to a fixed interest rate of
1.83 %. The agreement matured in
June 2022 . In March 2020, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on an additional $ 150,000
of notional principal that effectively converted the floating LIBOR portion of our interest obligation on that amount of debt to a fixed rate of
0.62 %. In July 2022, this agreement increased to a notional principal amount of $ 300,000 . In November 2022, we amended the March 2020 interest rate swap agreement to convert the floating portion of our interest obligation to SOFR. The agreement effectively converts the floating portion of our interest obligation on $ 300,000
of debt to a fixed interest rate of
0.61 % through
June 2025 . We have designated the interest rate swap as a highly effective cash flow hedge.
We have entered into foreign currency option contracts to hedge cash flows related to monthly inventory purchases. The individual option contracts mature monthly through
August 2023 . The forecasted inventory purchases are probable of occurring and the individual option contracts were designated as highly effective cash flow hedges. The consolidated balance sheet includes the net fair values of our outstanding foreign currency option contracts within the respective line items, based on the net financial position and maturity date of the individual contracts. The consolidated balance sheet includes the net fair values of our outstanding interest rate swap within the respective balance sheet line items, based on the expected timing of the cash flows. The consolidated balance sheet includes assets for the fair values of outstanding derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31,  ​ June 30,  As of

related to matured contracts. We anticipate the net losses included in inventory will be recognized in cost of goods sold within the next eighteen months. ​ 9.  Fair Value Measurements Short-term Investments Our short-term investments consist of cash deposits held at financial institutions. We consider the carrying amounts of these short-term investments to be representative of their fair value. Current Assets and Liabilities
We consider the carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities to be representative of their fair value because of the current nature of these items.
Debt
We record debt, including term loans and revolver balances, at amortized cost in our consolidated financial statements. We believe the carrying value of the debt is approximately equal to its fair value, due to the variable nature of the instruments and our evaluation of estimated market prices.
Derivatives We determine the fair value of derivative instruments based upon pricing models using observable market inputs for these types of financial instruments, such as spot and forward currency translation rates. Non-financial Assets Our non-financial assets, which primarily consist of goodwill, other intangible assets, property and equipment, and lease-related ROU assets, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and instead are reported at carrying value in the consolidated balance sheet. Assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting, including the initial recognition of net assets acquired in a business combination. These fair value measurements involve unobservable inputs that reflect estimates and assumptions that represent Level 3 inputs. 17

Certain of our costs and assets are not directly attributable to these segments and we refer to these items as Corporate. We do not allocate Corporate costs or assets to the segments because they are not used to evaluate the segments’ operating results or financial position. Corporate includes certain costs related to executive management, business technology, legal, finance, human resources and business development. We evaluate performance of our segments based on Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as income before income taxes plus (a) interest expense, net, (b) depreciation and amortization, (c) (income) loss from, and disposal of, discontinued operations, and (d) other expense or less other income, as separately reported on our consolidated statements of operations, including foreign currency (gains) losses, net and certain items that we consider to be unusual, non-operational or non-recurring. The accounting policies of our segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies included herein. 18

Table of Contents ​ Item 2.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) is provided to assist readers in understanding our performance, as reflected in the results of our operations, our financial condition and our cash flows. The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our future results could differ materially from our historical performance as a result of various factors such as those discussed in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of our Annual Report and “Forward-Looking Statements.” Overview of our business Phibro Animal Health Corporation is a global diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company. We develop, manufacture and market a broad range of products for food and companion animals including poultry, swine, beef and dairy cattle, aquaculture, and dogs. Our products help prevent, control and treat diseases, and support nutrition to help improve health and well-being. In addition to animal health and mineral nutrition products, we manufacture and market specific ingredients for use in the personal care, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. Armed Conflict between Russia and Ukraine In response to the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in February 2022, we and our employees have provided support to Ukraine in the form of monetary donations, free products and humanitarian services. Our limited intent for the Russian market is to continue to provide medicines and vaccines, and related regulatory and technical support, to help existing customers combat disease challenges in the production of food animals on their farms. We have no production or direct distribution operations and no planned investments in Russia. Since the conflict began, the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”) member states, as well as non-member states, announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia, including certain Russian citizens and enterprises. The continuation or escalation of the conflict may trigger additional economic and other sanctions, as well as broader military conflict. The potential impacts of any resulting bans, sanctions, boycotts or broader military conflicts on our business is uncertain at the current time due to the fluid nature of the conflict. The potential impacts could include supply chain and logistics disruptions, macroeconomic impacts resulting from the exclusion of Russian financial institutions from the global banking system, volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, inflationary pressures on raw materials and energy as well as heightened cybersecurity threats. Our annual sales to Russia and Ukraine represent approximately 1% of consolidated net sales. We cannot know if the conflict could escalate and result in broader economic and security concerns that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic The global food and animal production industry has experienced demand disruption, production impacts, price volatility and currency volatility in international markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid. We are unable to predict the future impact of COVID-19 on the economies where we manufacture and/or sell our products. We continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the effects of COVID-19 on our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For additional considerations and risks associated with COVID-19 on our business, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of our Annual Report. 20
Table of Contents Regulatory Developments In April 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) began initial steps to withdraw approval of carbadox (the active ingredient in our Mecadox product) via a regulatory process known as a Notice of Opportunity for Hearing (“NOOH”), due to concerns that certain residues from the product may persist in animal tissues for longer than previously determined. In the years following, Phibro has continued an ongoing process of responding collaboratively and transparently to the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”) inquiries and has provided extensive and meticulous research and data that confirmed the safety of carbadox. In July 2020, the FDA announced it would not proceed to a hearing on the scientific concerns raised in the 2016 NOOH, consistent with the normal regulatory procedure, but instead announced that it was withdrawing the 2016 NOOH and issuing a proposed order to review the regulatory method for carbadox. Phibro reiterated the safety of carbadox and the appropriateness of the regulatory method and offered to work with the CVM to generate additional data to support the existing regulatory method or select a suitable alternative regulatory method.
In the event the FDA continues to assert that carbadox should be removed from the market, we will argue that we are entitled to and expect to have a full evidentiary hearing on the merits before an administrative law judge. Should we be unable to successfully defend the safety of the product, the loss of carbadox sales will have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Sales of Mecadox (carbadox) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, were $20.0 million. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Mecadox continues to be available for use by swine producers. For additional information, see also “Business - Compliance with Government Regulations - United States - Carbadox”; and “Business - Compliance with Government Regulations - Global policy and guidance” in Item 1 of our Annual Report. 21

Table of Contents Comparison of three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Net sales Net sales of $244.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased $11.9 million, or 5%, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Animal Health and Performance Products increased $12.9 million and $4.1 million, respectively. Mineral Nutrition decreased $5.0 million. Animal Health Net sales of $163.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased $12.9 million, or 9%. Net sales of MFAs and other increased $5.5 million, or 6%, due to increased demand for our MFAs in Latin America and for processing aids used in the ethanol fermentation industry. Net sales of nutritional specialty products increased $6.5 million, or 17%, due mostly to higher domestic demand and higher average selling prices for dairy products, along with growth in the companion animal product. Net sales of vaccines increased $0.9 million, or 4%, due to increased demand. Mineral Nutrition Net sales of $61.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, decreased $5.0 million, or 8%, driven by a decrease in demand for trace minerals, partially offset by higher average selling prices. The increase in average selling prices is correlated to the movement of the underlying raw material costs. Performance Products Net sales of $19.2 million for the three months ended
December 31,
2022, increased $4.1 million, or 27%, primarily as a result of increased demand for copper-based products and higher average selling prices for copper-based products and ingredients for personal care products. Gross profit Gross profit of $77.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased $6.7 million, or 9%, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 31.6% of net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 30.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to favorable product and geographical mix and lower production costs. Animal Health gross profit increased $6.3 million, primarily driven by higher sales volumes and favorable production costs. Mineral Nutrition gross profit decreased $1.1 million, driven primarily by lower sales volume and an increase in raw material costs. Performance Products gross profit increased $1.5 million as a result of increased demand and higher average selling prices for copper-based products. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) of $61.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased $13.2 million, or 27%, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. SG&A for the three months ended December 31, 2022, included $6.6 million of environmental remediation costs. The majority of these environmental remediation costs relate to a tentative settlement we have reached in a lawsuit concerning alleged historical environmental contamination from a facility in California we acquired years ago within our Performance Products segment. SG&A for the three months ended December 31, 2021, included a $1.2 million gain on sale of investment. Excluding the environmental remediation costs and the gain on sale of investment, SG&A increased $5.4 million, or 11%. Animal Health SG&A increased $3.4 million, primarily due to an increase in employee-related and other miscellaneous costs. Mineral Nutrition SG&A was comparable to prior year. Performance Products SG&A increased $0.5 million. Corporate costs increased by $1.4 million, driven by net changes in costs related to employees and strategic investments. 24
Table of Contents Interest expense, net Interest expense, net of $3.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased by $0.9 million, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to increased debt outstanding, partially offset by an increase in interest income and lower average fixed rates in our interest rate swap agreement. Foreign currency gains, net Foreign currency gains, net for the three months ended December 31, 2022, were $0.1 million, as compared to $4.2 million of net gains for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Prior period gains were driven by the weakening of certain currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes was $4.9 million and $6.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 40.5% and 25.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The current provision for income taxes was impacted by the final foreign tax credit regulations that were in effect during the three months ended December 31, 2022, in addition to losses generated in international jurisdictions where no tax benefit is being recognized.
Net income Net income of $7.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, decreased $10.3 million, as compared to net income of $17.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Operating income decreased $6.5 million, driven by higher SG&A, partially offset by favorable gross profit. Excluding the $6.6 million environmental remediation costs, operating income would have increased $0.1 million. The increase in gross profit was due to higher product demand and higher selling prices. Interest expense, net increased $0.9 million and foreign currency gains, net decreased $4.0 million. Income tax expense decreased by $1.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA of $30.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased $1.8 million, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Animal Health Adjusted EBITDA increased $3.4 million due to higher gross profit margin, partially offset by higher SG&A. Performance Products Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.0 million due to higher gross profit, also partially offset by higher SG&A. Mineral Nutrition Adjusted EBITDA decreased $1.1 million, driven by lower gross profit. Corporate expenses increased $1.4 million, driven by increased costs related to employees and strategic investments. Comparison of six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Net sales
Net sales of $477.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, increased $29.8 million, or 7%, as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021.

Performance Products SG&A increased $0.8 million, mainly due to an increase in employee costs. Corporate expenses increased $2.1 million due to an increase in employee and employee-related costs. Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net of $7.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, increased $1.1 million, or 19%, as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. Interest expense increased as a result of increased debt outstanding, partially offset by an increase in interest income and lower average fixed rates in our interest rate swap agreement. Foreign currency (gains) losses, net
Foreign currency (gains) losses, net for the six months ended December 31, 2022, amounted to net losses of $5.1 million, as compared to net (gains) of $(2.1) million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Current period losses were driven by the weakening of the certain currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Provision for income taxes
The provision for income taxes was $6.5 million and $9.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective income tax rate was 36.9% and 27.6% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The provision for income taxes for the six months ended December 31, 2022, included a $0.9 million benefit related to exchange rate differences on intercompany dividends and a $0.2 million expense from changes in uncertain tax positions related to prior years. The effective income tax rate, without these items, would have been 41.0% for the six months ended December 31, 2022.

Table of Contents Net income
Net income of $11.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, decreased $12.9 million, as compared to net income of $24.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Operating income decreased $7.4 million driven by higher gross profit offset by higher SG&A. The increase in gross profit was driven by higher average selling prices in Animal Health and Performance Products, partially offset by higher raw material cost and production costs. SG&A expenses increased due to environmental remediation costs, higher employee-related costs and strategic investments. The change in foreign currency (gains) losses resulted in a $7.1 million reduction in income before income taxes. Income tax expense decreased $2.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA of $53.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, increased $1.5 million, or 3%, as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. Animal Health Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.7 million, resulting from higher sales and increased gross profit, partially offset by higher SG&A. Performance Products Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.2 million, driven by higher sales and gross profit, partially offset by an increase in SG&A. Mineral Nutrition Adjusted EBITDA decreased $0.4 million. Corporate expenses increased $2.0 million due to increased employee and employee-related costs.

Table of Contents for changes in operating assets and liabilities and other items was $50.3 million. Cash provided by receivables was $14.8 million as a result of changes in sales levels from seasonality and a favorable reduction in days sales outstanding. Cash used for inventory was $29.1 million due to increased raw material and production costs, product mix, and a projected increase in demand. Other current assets used $7.7 million of cash, primarily due to prepayment of taxes, including value-added tax. Accounts payable used $14.6 million of cash due to timing of purchases and payments. Accrued expenses and other liabilities used cash of $4.3 million, primarily due to changes in employee-related liabilities and lease payments. Investing activities Investing activities used $26.0 million of net cash for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Capital expenditures totaled $33.0 million, which included $15.0 million for the purchase of additional land and building at an operating facility, primarily for continued investments in expanded production capacity and productivity improvements. Maturities of our short-term investments provided $7.0 million. Financing activities Financing activities provided $33.0 million of net cash for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Net borrowings on our 2021 Revolver provided $39.0 million. Proceeds from the 2022 Term Loan provided $12.0 million. We paid $7.6 million in scheduled debt maturities. We paid $9.7 million in dividends to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock.
Liquidity and capital resources We believe our cash on hand, operating cash flows and financing arrangements, including the availability of borrowings under the 2021 Revolver and foreign credit lines, will be sufficient to support our ongoing cash needs. We are aware of the current and potential future effects of the macroeconomic market conditions in the financial markets. At this time, we expect adequate liquidity for at least the next twelve months. However, we can provide no assurance that our liquidity and capital resources will be adequate for future funding requirements. We believe we will comply with the terms of the covenants under the 2021 Credit Facilities and foreign credit lines based on our operating plan. In the event of adverse operating results and/or violation of covenants under the facilities, there can be no assurance we would be able to obtain waivers or amendments. Other risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions and macroeconomic, business and financial disruptions that could arise, including those caused by COVID-19. There can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn would not affect our liquidity or ability to obtain future financing or fund operations or investment opportunities. In addition, our debt covenants may restrict our ability to invest. Certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources follow: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      December 31,       June 30,  As of

299,152 Ratio of current assets to current liabilities ​   3.31:1 ​   2.70:1 ​ We define working capital as total current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments) less total current liabilities (excluding current portion of long-term debt). We calculate the ratio of current assets to current liabilities based on this definition. As of December 31, 2022, we had $184.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the 2021 Revolver and outstanding letters of credit and other commitments of $2.5 million, leaving $123.5 million available for further borrowings and letters of credit, subject to restrictions in our 2021 Credit Facilities.
We currently intend to pay quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock, subject to approval from the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.12 per share on Class A and Class B common stock, payable on March 22, 2023. Our future ability to pay dividends will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital
28
Table of Contents requirements, our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Additionally, the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions. As of December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments included $75.3 million held by our international subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on cash distributions to PAHC from our international subsidiaries. Contractual obligations As of December 31, 2022, there were no material changes in payments due under contractual obligations from those disclosed in the Annual Report.
Off-balance sheet arrangements We do not currently use off-balance sheet arrangements for the purpose of credit enhancement, hedging transactions, investment or other financial purposes. In the ordinary course of business, we may indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise. These indemnifications typically pertain to environmental matters. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications generally are subject to certain restrictions and limitations. General description of non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is an alternative view of performance used by management as our primary operating measure, and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. We report Adjusted EBITDA to reflect the results of our operations prior to considering certain income statement elements. We have defined EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (i) interest expense, net, (ii) provision for income taxes or less benefit for income taxes, and (iii) depreciation and amortization. We have defined Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus (a) (income) loss from, and disposal of, discontinued operations, (b) other expense or less other income, as separately reported on our consolidated statements of operations, including foreign currency gains and losses, and (c) certain items that we consider to be unusual, non-operational or non-recurring. The Adjusted EBITDA measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP reported net income. The Adjusted EBITDA measure is an important internal measurement for us. We measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. The following are examples of how our Adjusted EBITDA measure is utilized: ● senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an Adjusted EBITDA basis; ● our annual budgets are prepared on an Adjusted EBITDA basis; and ● other goal setting and performance measurements are prepared on an Adjusted EBITDA basis. Despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement, Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, has limits in its usefulness to investors. Because of its non-standardized definition, Adjusted EBITDA, unlike GAAP net income, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. We also recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the Adjusted EBITDA measure has limitations, and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to this metric. A limitation of the Adjusted EBITDA measure is that it provides a
29
Table of Contents view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the depreciation of property, plant and equipment or amortization of acquired intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies. Certain significant items Adjusted EBITDA is calculated prior to considering certain items. We evaluate such items on an individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual or non-operational nature. Unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We consider acquisition-related activities and business restructuring costs related to productivity and cost saving initiatives, including employee separation costs, to be unusual items that we do not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We consider foreign currency gains and losses to be non-operational because they arise principally from intercompany transactions and are largely non-cash in nature. New accounting standards For discussion of new accounting standards, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Standards.” Critical Accounting Policies Critical accounting policies are those that require application of management’s most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Not all accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates. In presenting our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results that differ from our estimates and assumptions could have an unfavorable effect on our financial position and results of operations. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, business combinations, long-lived assets, goodwill, and income taxes. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this report are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements discuss our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “potential,” “project,” “projection,” “plan,” “intend,” “seek,” “may,” “could,” “would,” “will,” “should,” “can,” “can have,” “likely,” the negatives thereof and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. For example, all statements we make relating to our estimated and projected earnings, revenues, costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth or initiatives, strategies, or the expected outcome or impact of pending or threatened litigation are forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected. Examples of such risks and uncertainties include: ● the negative effects of a pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease in humans, such as COVID-19, on our business, financial results, manufacturing facilities and supply chain, as well as our customers, protein processors and markets; ● perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products could cause a decline in the sales of those products; ● restrictions on the use of antibacterials in food-producing animals may become more prevalent; 30
Table of Contents ● the potential FDA withdrawal of approval of our Mecadox (carbadox) product; ● a material portion of our sales and gross profits are generated by antibacterials and other related products; ● competition in each of our markets from a number of large and small companies, some of which have greater financial, research and development (“R&D”), production and other resources than we have; ● outbreaks of animal diseases could significantly reduce demand for our products; ● our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions and the availability of natural resources; ● climate change could have a material adverse impact on our operations and our customers’ businesses; ● actions of regulatory bodies, including obtaining approvals related to the testing, manufacturing and marketing of certain of our products;
● the continuing trend toward consolidation of certain customer groups as well as the emergence of large buying groups; ● our ability to control costs and expenses; ● any unforeseen material loss or casualty; ● misuse or extra-label use of our products; ● exposure relating to rising costs and reduced customer income; ● heightened competition, including those from generics and those deriving from advances in veterinary medical practices and animal health technologies; ● unanticipated safety or efficacy concerns; ● our dependence on suppliers having current regulatory approvals; ● our raw materials are subject to price fluctuations and their availability can be limited; ● natural and man-made disasters, including but not limited to fire, snow and ice storms, flood, hail, hurricanes and earthquakes; ● business interruption from political and social instability, including crime, civil disturbance, terrorist activities, outbreaks of disease and pandemics and armed conflicts, such as the current armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine; ● terrorist attacks, particularly attacks on or within markets in which we operate; ● risks related to changes in tax rates and exposure; ● our ability to successfully implement our strategic initiatives; ● our reliance on the continued operation of our manufacturing facilities and application of our intellectual property; ● adverse U.S. and international economic market conditions, including currency fluctuations; ● failure of our product approval, R&D, acquisition and licensing efforts to generate new products; 31
Table of Contents ● the risks of product liability claims, legal proceedings and general litigation expenses; ● the impact of current and future laws and regulatory changes, including risks related to the protection of our customers’ privacy and risks related to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations; ● modification of foreign trade policy may harm our food animal product customers; ● our dependence on our Israeli and Brazilian operations; ● impact of increased or decreased inventory levels at our direct customers or channel distributors; ● our substantial level of indebtedness and related debt-service obligations; ● restrictions imposed by covenants in our debt agreements; ● the risk of work stoppages; and ● other factors as described in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of our Annual Report. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, or cautionary statements, are disclosed under “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this report in the context of these risks and uncertainties. We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences we anticipate or affect us or our operations in the way we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. ​ ​ ​ Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of operations, we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. As a result, future earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty. We use, from time to time, foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps as a means of hedging exposure to foreign currency risks and fluctuating interest rates, respectively. We do not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We do not hedge our exposure to market risks in a manner that eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings, cash flows and fair values. We monitor the financial stability and credit standing of our major counterparties. For financial market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, reference is made to the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk” section in the Annual Report and to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included therein. As of the date of this report, there were no material changes in the Company’s financial market risks from the risks disclosed in the Annual Report. ​ 32
