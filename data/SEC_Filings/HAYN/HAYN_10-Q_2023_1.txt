Table of Contents ​ ​ HAYNES INTERNATIONAL, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (in thousands, except share and per share data) ​ Note 1.  Basis of Presentation ​ Interim Financial Statements ​ The accompanying unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and such principles are applied on a basis consistent with information reflected in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC related to interim financial statements. In the opinion of management, the interim financial information includes all adjustments and accruals which are necessary for a fair presentation of results for the respective interim periods. The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending September 30, 2023 or any other interim period. ​ Principles of Consolidation ​ The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Haynes International, Inc. and directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”).  All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated. ​ Note 2.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards ​ In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848).
This new update provides optional expedients to ease the potential burden of accounting for the effects of reference rate reform as it pertains to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued.  These amendments are effective immediately and may be applied prospectively to modifications made or relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022.  This standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.   ​ Note 3.  Revenues from Contracts with Customers ​ Contract Balances ​ As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, accounts receivable with customers were $ 95,340
and $ 92,443 , respectively.
Allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022 were
$ 428
and $ 476 , respectively, and are presented within accounts receivable, less allowance for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
​ Contract liabilities are recognized when the Company has received consideration from a customer to transfer goods or services at a future point in time when the Company performs under the purchase order or contract.  As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, contract liabilities of $ 10,329
and $ 9,704 , respectively, for the Titanium Metals Corporation agreement, as described in Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement have been recorded.
Additionally, contract liabilities of
$ 700
and $ 1,000 , respectively, were recorded for accrued product returns.

21.0 %, primarily due to state income taxes,
differing tax rates on foreign earnings and discrete tax items that impacted income tax expense (benefit) in these periods.  The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was
22.5 % on $ 9,984
of income before income taxes compared to

to its U.S. pension plan and $ 2,683
to its other post-retirement benefit plan for the remainder of fiscal 2023.  Additional contributions may be made to the U.S. pension plan as part of the Company’s capital allocation strategy, however, the amounts and timing have not yet been determined .   ​ ​ 8
Table of Contents Note 7.  Legal, Environmental and Other Contingencies ​ Legal ​ The Company is regularly involved in litigation, both as a plaintiff and as a defendant, relating to its business and operations, including environmental, commercial, asbestos, employment and federal and/or state Equal Employment Opportunity Commission administrative actions. Future expenditures for environmental, employment, intellectual property and other legal matters cannot be determined with any degree of certainty.
Environmental The Company has received permits from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources to close and provide post-closure environmental monitoring and care for certain areas of its Kokomo, Indiana and Mountain Home, North Carolina facilities, respectively.   The Company is required to, among other things, monitor groundwater and to continue post-closure maintenance of the former disposal areas at each site. As a result, the Company is aware of elevated levels of certain contaminants in the groundwater, and additional testing and corrective action by the Company could be required.  The Company is unable to estimate the costs of any further corrective action at these sites, if required. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure that the costs of any future corrective action at these or any other current or former sites would not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, the Company has accrued $ 407
for post-closure monitoring and maintenance activities, of which $ 341
is included in long-term obligations as it is not due within one year.  Accruals for these costs are calculated by estimating the cost to monitor and maintain each post-closure site and multiplying that amount by the number of years remaining in the post-closure monitoring. Expected maturities of post-closure monitoring and maintenance activities (discounted) included in long-term obligations are as follows at December 31, 2022.   ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Expected maturities of post-closure monitoring and maintenance activities (discounted)      ​   Year Ending September 30, ​ ​ ​ 2024 $

341 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Note 8.  Deferred Revenue ​ On November 17, 2006, the Company entered into a
twenty-year
agreement to provide conversion services to Titanium Metals Corporation (TIMET) for up to
ten
million pounds of titanium metal annually. TIMET paid the Company a
$ 50,000
up-front fee and will also pay the Company for its processing services during the term of the agreement ( 20 years ) at prices established by the terms of the agreement. TIMET may exercise an option to have
ten
million additional pounds of titanium converted annually, provided that it offers to loan up to
$ 12,000
to the Company for certain capital expenditures which may be required to expand capacity. In addition to the volume commitment, the Company has granted TIMET a first priority security interest in its four-high Steckel rolling mill, along with rights of access if the Company enters into bankruptcy or defaults on any financing arrangements. The Company has agreed not to manufacture titanium products (other than cold reduced titanium tubing). The Company has also agreed not to provide titanium hot-rolling conversion services to any entity other than TIMET for the term of the Conversion Services Agreement.
​ The agreement contains certain default provisions which could result in contract termination and damages, including liquidated damages of
$ 25,000  and the Company being required to return the unearned portion of the up-front fee. The Company considered each provision and the likelihood of the occurrence of a default that would result in liquidated damages. Based on the nature of the events that could trigger the liquidated damages clause, and the availability of the cure periods set forth in the agreement, the Company determined and continues to believe that none of these circumstances are reasonably likely to occur. Therefore, events resulting in liquidated damages have not been factored in as a reduction to the amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract. The cash received of
$ 50,000
is recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the
20-year
term of the agreement. If an event of default
9
Table of Contents occurred and was not cured within any applicable grace period, the Company would recognize the impact of the liquidated damages in the period of default and re-evaluate revenue recognition under the contract for future periods. The portion of the up-front fee not recognized in income is shown as deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. ​ Note 9.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net ​ The Company has goodwill, trademarks, customer relationships and other intangibles.  Customer relationships have a definite life and are amortized over a period of
fifteen years .  The Company reviews customer relationships for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.   If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset.   ​ Goodwill and trademarks (indefinite lived) are tested for impairment at least annually as of January 31 for goodwill and August 31 for trademarks (the annual impairment testing dates), and more frequently if impairment indicators exist.  If the carrying value of a trademark exceeds its fair value (determined using an income approach, based upon a discounted cash flow of an assumed royalty rate), impairment of the trademark may exist resulting in a charge to earnings to the extent of the impairment.  The impairment test for goodwill is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment loss in the event that the carrying amount is greater than the fair value.  Any goodwill impairment loss recognized would not exceed the total carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.   No

Table of Contents Note 10.  Net Income (Loss) Per Share ​ The Company accounts for earnings per share using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation that determines net income per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to participation rights in undistributed earnings. Non-vested restricted stock awards that include non-forfeitable rights to dividends are considered participating securities.  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. ​ The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the periods indicated: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended

The volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected term of the stock option granted. The Company uses historical volatility because management believes such volatility is representative of prospective trends. The expected term of an award is based on historical exercise data. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest

Table of Contents rates appropriate for the expected term of the awards.  The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s history and expectations regarding dividend payouts at the time of the grant.   The following assumptions were used for grants during fiscal year 2023: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      Fair      Dividend      Risk-free      Expected      Expected   Grant Date ​ Value ​ Yield ​ Interest Rate ​ Volatility ​ Life   November 22, 2022 ​ $ 20.52

per outstanding share of the Company’s common stock.  The dividend is payable March 15, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2023. ​ Note 13.  Fair Value Measurements ​ The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the inputs used to determine fair value. ​ ●
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; ●
Level 2 — Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and ●
Level 3 — Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. ​ When available, the Company uses unadjusted quoted market prices to measure fair value. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally-developed models that use, where possible, current market-based or independently-sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally-generated models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation.  The valuation model used depends on the specific asset or liability being valued.
Fixed income securities are held as individual bonds and are valued as either level 1 assets as they are quoted in active markets or level 2 assets.  U.S and International equities, and Other Investments held in the Company’s pension plan are held as individual bonds or in mutual funds and common / collective funds which are valued using net asset value (NAV) provided by the administrator of the fund.  The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.  These investments are not classified in the fair value hierarchy in accordance with guidance included in ASU 2015-07,

million to $ 160.0
million, subject to a borrowing base and certain reserves.   14
Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2022, the amounts borrowed by the Company under the Credit Agreement totalled $ 88.0
million which is classified as long-term on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  With the amendment executed on October 7, 2022, the Credit Agreement provides for revolving loans in the maximum amount of $ 160.0
million, subject to a borrowing base and certain reserves. The Credit Agreement has a remaining accordion which permits an increase in the maximum revolving loan amount from $ 160.0
million up to an aggregate amount of $ 170.0
million at the request of the borrower if certain conditions are met. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either JPMorgan’s “prime rate”, plus
1.25 % -
1.75 % per annum, or the adjusted SOFR rate (SOFR plus
0.10 %) by the lender, plus
2.25 % -
2.75 % per annum (with a SOFR floor of
0.5 %).     The Company must pay monthly, in arrears, a commitment fee of
0.425 % per annum on the unused amount of the U.S. revolving credit facility total commitment. For letters of credit, the Company must pay a fronting fee of
0.125 % per annum as well as customary fees for issuance, amendments and processing.
The Company is subject to certain covenants as to fixed charge coverage ratios and other customary covenants, including covenants restricting the incurrence of indebtedness, the granting of liens and the sale of assets. The covenant pertaining to fixed charge coverage ratios is only effective in the event the amount of excess availability under the revolver is less than the greater of (i)
12.5 % of the maximum credit revolving loan amount and (ii) $ 12.5
million. The Company is permitted to pay dividends and repurchase common stock if certain financial metrics are met.  The Company may pay quarterly cash dividends up to $ 3.5
million per fiscal quarter so long as the Company is not in default under the Credit Documents. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are collateralized by a pledge of substantially all of the U.S. assets of the Company, including the equity interests in its U.S. subsidiaries, but excluding the four-high Steckel rolling mill and related assets, which are pledged to Titanium Metals Corporation (“TIMET”) to secure the performance of the Company’s obligations under a Conversion Services Agreement with TIMET (see discussion of TIMET at Note  8).
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are also secured by a pledge of a
100 % equity interest in each of the Company’s direct foreign subsidiaries. ​ Note 17.  Foreign Currency Forward Contracts ​ The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce income statement volatility resulting from foreign currency denominated transactions. The Company has not designated the contracts as hedges, therefore, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.  All of these contracts are designed to be settled within the same fiscal quarter they are entered into and, accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, there were no contracts that remain unsettled.  As a result, there was no impact to the balance sheet from those contracts as of September 30, 2022 or December 31, 2022.  Foreign exchange contract gains and losses are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations along with foreign currency transactional gains and losses as follows. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended December 31,  ​ ​      2021      2022      Foreign currency transactional gain (loss) ​ $

(“Haynes”, “the Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is one of the world’s largest developers, producers, and distributors of technologically advanced high-performance nickel- and cobalt-based alloys.  The Company’s products, which are sold primarily into the aerospace, chemical processing and industrial gas turbine industries, consist of high-temperature resistant alloys, or “HTA” products, and corrosion-resistant alloys, or “CRA” products. HTA products are used by manufacturers of equipment that is subjected to extremely high temperatures, such as jet engines for the aerospace market, gas turbine engines used for power generation and industrial heating equipment. CRA products are used in applications that require resistance to very corrosive media found in chemical processing, power plant emissions control and waste treatment. Haynes high-performance alloy sales in sheet, coil and plate forms, in the aggregate, represented approximately 62% of net product revenues in fiscal 2022. The Company also produces its products as seamless and welded tubulars, which represented approximately 13% of fiscal 2022 net product revenues and in wire form, which represented approximately 7% of fiscal 2022 net product revenues.  The Company also produces its products in slab, bar and billet form and sales of these forms, in the aggregate, represented approximately 18% of fiscal 2022 net product revenues. The Company has manufacturing facilities in Kokomo, Indiana; Arcadia, Louisiana; and Mountain Home, North Carolina. The Kokomo facility specializes in flat products, the Arcadia facility specializes in tubular products, and the Mountain Home facility specializes in wire products. The Company’s products are sold primarily through its direct sales organization, which includes 11 service and/or sales centers in the United States, Europe and Asia. All of these centers are Company-operated. ​ Dividends Paid and Declared ​ In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company declared and paid a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per outstanding share of the Company’s common stock. The first quarter dividend was paid on December 19, 2022 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2022.  The total dividend cash pay-out in the first quarter was approximately $2.8 million based on the number of shares outstanding.
​ On February 2, 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per outstanding share of the Company’s common stock.  The dividend is payable March 15, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2023.  Any future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors.   ​ 16
Table of Contents Capital Spending ​ During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, capital investment was $3.3 million, and total planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 are expected to be between $20.0 million and $24.0 million.
​ Volume and Pricing ​ Volume shipped in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was 4.6 million pounds.  First quarter volume is typically impacted by holidays, planned maintenance outages and customers managing their calendar year-end balance sheets.  As a result, volume dropped sequentially by 6.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, however compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year, volume increased 17.4%.   Aerospace volume increased 17.3% along with a 13.5% increase in aerospace average selling price resulting in a 33.2% or $16.1 million aerospace revenue increase compared to the prior year. The volume increase is primarily driven by the single-aisle aircraft recovery. Volumes in the chemical processing industry (CPI) decreased by 1.0%, however CPI average selling price increased 31.5% resulting in a 30.2% or $5.2 million CPI revenue increase compared to the prior year. Industrial gas turbine (IGT) volumes were up 61.3% along with a 10.5% increase in the IGT average selling price resulting in a 78.3% or $11.4 million IGT revenue increase compared to the prior year.  Other markets revenue increased 1.6%, and other revenue increased by 5.7%.  Overall, volumes are expected to increase with the high level of backlog.
​ The Company has an ongoing strategy of increasing margins, recognizing the high-value, differentiated products and services it offers. The Company implemented multiple price increases for contract and non-contract business as market conditions improved and in response to higher inflation.  Customer long-term agreements typically have adjustors for specific raw material prices and for changes in the producer price index to help cover general inflationary items.  The product average selling price per pound in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was $28.12, which increased 14.8% year-over-year primarily due to the noted price increases and raw material adjustors.   ​ Set forth below are selected data relating to the Company’s net revenues, gross profit, backlog, the 30-day average nickel price per pound as reported by the London Metals Exchange and a breakdown of net revenues, shipments and average selling prices to the markets served by the Company for the periods shown. The data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the remainder of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Form 10-Q.

Volatility of raw materials, specifically nickel and cobalt, have impacted gross margins.
During fiscal 2022 this impact was favorable due to rising raw material prices which increased gross margins, however in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 this impact was unfavorable due to decreasing raw material prices which lowered gross margins.
The estimated impact from raw material volatility in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was a headwind of $5.6 million compressing gross margin percentage by approximately 4.2%, which resulted in a gross margin percentage of 17.4%.
This compares to the previous year’s estimated impact in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 which was a favorable tailwind of approximately $1.7 million which increased gross margin percentage by approximately 1.7%, resulting in gross margin percentage of 17.9%.
​ A significant strategic effort to improve gross margins has occurred over the past few years.
As a result of this strategy, the Company reduced the volume breakeven point by over 25%. The Company previously struggled to be profitable at roughly 5.0 million pounds. With the current product mix, the Company can generate profits at lower volumes as first demonstrated in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, producing a positive net income at only 3.7 million pounds shipped. As volumes continue to rise, margin leverage is expected to continue with gross margins (excluding raw material impacts) of over 20% even with the inflation headwind. 17

Net revenues were $132.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of 33.4% from the same period of fiscal 2022 due to increases in volume in key markets, combined with increases in average selling price per pound in all markets.  The increase in pounds sold is due to strong sales in the aerospace market, as well as the industrial gas turbine market, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022.  The increase in product average selling price per pound largely reflects price increases and other sales factors, which increased the average selling price per pound by approximately $4.19, and higher market prices of raw materials, which increased average selling price per pound by approximately $1.07, partially offset by change in product mix, which decreased average selling price per pound by approximately $1.64.

Table of Contents ​
The aerospace market has experienced increased demand as inventory throughout the aerospace supply chain continues to be replenished in response to the expected increase in engine build. The increase in average selling price per pound largely reflects price increases and other pricing factors, which increased average selling price per pound by approximately $5.43 and higher market prices of raw materials, which increased average selling price per pound by approximately $1.25, partially offset by a change in product mix, which decreased average selling price per pound by approximately $3.18.
​ Volume to the chemical processing market in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was similar to the same period in fiscal 2022.  The increase in average selling price per pound reflects price increases and other sales factors, which increased average selling price per pound by approximately $4.37 and higher market prices of raw materials, which increased average selling price per pound by approximately $1.21 per pound, along with a change in product mix, which increased average selling price per pound by approximately $1.34.
​ The increase in volume in the industrial gas turbine market is largely attributable to the recovered demand from the same period last year.  The increase in average selling price per pound reflects price increases and other sales factors, which increased average selling price per pound by approximately $1.62 and higher market prices of raw materials, which increased average selling price per pound by approximately $0.92 per pound, partially offset by a change in product mix, predominately due to higher sales of ingots, which decreased average selling price per pound by approximately $0.62.
​ Volume to the other markets declined in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 from the same period in fiscal 2022 mainly due to reduced sales of lower-value products into the flue-gas desulfurization market.  The average selling price per pound increase to other markets reflects price increases and other sales factors, which increased average selling price per pound by approximately $8.87 combined with  a change in product mix, which increased average selling price per pound by approximately $7.41.   ​ Other Revenue.
The increase in other revenue was due primarily to increased sales of conversion services.   ​ Cost of Sales.
The 0.5% increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to higher raw material costs flowing through cost of goods sold, partially offset by variable cost saving measures.   ​ Gross Profit.
As a result of the above factors, gross profit was $23.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of $5.3 million from the same period of fiscal 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 17.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to 17.9% in the same period of fiscal 2022.  The first quarter of fiscal 2023 was adversely affected by increasing raw material prices included in cost of sales relative to the impact of raw material prices in selling prices which lowered gross margin.  Partially offsetting the compression of margins due to raw material price changes was increased gross profit generated from variable cost saving measures and a higher utilization of fixed costs driven from greater volumes shipped.
​ Selling, General and Administrative Expense.
The 3.1% decrease in selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues was largely driven by higher net revenues and the benefit of lower expenses in fiscal 2023.  Additionally, exchange rate losses of $(0.6) million recorded in first quarter of fiscal 2022 also contributed to the decrease in expenses from the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to the first quarter of fiscal 2023.   ​ Nonoperating retirement benefit expense (income).
The lower benefit recorded in nonoperating retirement benefit was primarily driven by an increase in the discount rate used in the actuarial valuation of the U.S. pension plan liability as of September 30, 2022 which resulted in a higher interest cost component of nonoperating retirement benefit expense (income) in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022.   Partially offsetting the higher interest cost was the amortization of the actuarial gains of the U.S. pension plan liability in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
​ Income Taxes.
The increase in income tax expense was driven primarily by a difference in income before income taxes of $3.7 million.
​ Working Capital ​ Controllable working capital, which includes accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses, was $402.0 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $23.7 million, or 6.3%, from $378.3 million at September 30, 2022. The increase resulted primarily from inventory increasing by $33.0 million during the first three months of fiscal 2023, partially offset by accounts payable and accrued expenses increasing by $6.3 million and accounts receivable decreasing by $2.9 million during the same period.   20
Table of Contents ​ Liquidity and Capital Resources ​ Comparative cash flow analysis ​ The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $11.5 million at December 31, 2022, inclusive of $10.8 million that was held by foreign subsidiaries in various currencies, compared to $8.4 million at September 30, 2022.  Additionally, the Company had $88.0 million of borrowings against the $160.0 million line of credit outstanding with remaining capacity available of $72.0 million as of December 31, 2022, putting total liquidity at $83.5 million.
​ Net cash used in operating activities in the first three months of fiscal 2023 was $7.0 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $23.8 million in the first three months of fiscal 2022.  The decrease in cash used in operating activities in the first three months of fiscal 2023 was driven by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $4.6 million as compared to a decrease of $13.3 million during the same period of fiscal 2022, a difference of $17.8 million, and higher net income of $7.7 million the first three months of fiscal 2023 as compared to net income of $4.7 million during the same period of fiscal 2022.  This was partially offset by an increase in inventory of $29.2 million during the first three months of fiscal 2023 as compared to an increase in inventory of $22.7 million during the same period of fiscal 2022.   ​ Net cash used in investing activities was $3.3 million in the first three months of fiscal 2023, which was comparable to investing activities of $3.3 million during the same period of fiscal 2022 due to a similar level of additions to property, plant and equipment.   ​ Net cash provided by financing activities was $12.7 million in the first three months of fiscal 2023, a difference of $19.1 million from cash used in financing activities of $6.4 million during the first three months of fiscal 2022.  This difference was primarily driven by a net borrowing of $13.3 million against the revolving line of credit during the first three months of fiscal 2023 compared to a net borrowing of $3.0 million during the same period of fiscal 2022 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $3.4 million during the first three months of fiscal 2023 as compared to proceeds from exercise of stock options of $0.1 million during the same period of fiscal 2022 and lower share repurchases of $0.8 million in the first three months of fiscal 2023 as compared to $6.6 million during the same period of fiscal 2022.  Dividends paid of $2.8 million during the first three months of fiscal 2023 were comparable to same period of fiscal 2022.   ​ U.S. revolving credit facility On October 19, 2020, the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) and related Pledge and Security Agreement with certain other lenders (the “Security Agreement”, and, together with the Credit Agreement, the “Credit Documents”).  The Credit Documents were subsequently amended to extend the maturity of the agreement to April 19, 2024 and switch from a LIBOR-based interest rate calculation to a SOFR-based interest rate calculation.  On October 7, 2022, the Company again amended the Credit Agreement to implement an accordion feature that increased the maximum borrowing amount from $100.0 million to $160.0 million, subject to a borrowing base and certain reserves.  The Credit Agreement has a remaining accordion which permits an increase in the maximum revolving loan amount from $160.0 million up to an aggregate amount of $170.0 million at the request of the borrower if certain conditions are met (See Note 16).
Future sources and uses of liquidity ​ The Company’s sources of liquidity for the next twelve months are expected to consist primarily of cash generated from operations, cash on-hand and borrowings under the U.S. revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of $11.5 million, an outstanding balance of $88.0 million on the U.S. revolving credit facility (described above) and total remaining borrowing availability against the revolving credit facility of approximately $72.0 million, subject to a borrowing base formula and certain reserves.  Management believes that the resources described above will be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures, any regular quarterly dividends declared and working capital requirements over the next twelve months. The Company’s primary uses of cash over the next twelve months are expected to consist of expenditures related to: ​ ●
Funding operations, including raw material purchases, labor costs, insurance, utilities, equipment maintenance; ​ ●
Capital spending, including for purchases of new plant and equipment; ​ ●
Dividends to stockholders; and ​ ●
Pension and postretirement plan contributions, including an anticipated contribution to the U.S. pension plan of $4.5 million during the remainder of fiscal 2023.   21
Table of Contents The Company expects to fund these uses of cash with existing cash on-hand, cash generated from net income over the next twelve months and additional borrowings from the revolving credit facility.  The Company anticipates that cash generated from net income, as a result of increased revenue as the Company works through the record backlog, will have a favorable result on the Company’s cash flow from operations in later quarters of fiscal 2023 and into fiscal 2024.  Additional demands for inventory are expected to be lower than in previous quarters as much of the necessary work-in-process inventory is currently in place.  Conversely, the Company has several capital projects underway which will result in higher capital spending than amounts spent in recent quarters which are expected to be funded by cash generated from operations or increased borrowings on the U.S. credit facility, if needed. ​ New Accounting Pronouncements ​ See Note 2. Recently Issued Accounting Standards in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ​ Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates ​ The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Assumptions and estimates were based on the facts and circumstances known at December 31, 2022. However, future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. The accounting policies discussed in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 are considered by management to be the most important to an understanding of the financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These policies are also discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of that report. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, there were no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates.   ​ ​ Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk ​ As of December 31, 2022, there were no material changes in the market risks described in “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. ​ Item 4. Controls and Procedures ​ The Company has performed, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness and the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. ​ There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. ​ ​ ​ ​ 22
