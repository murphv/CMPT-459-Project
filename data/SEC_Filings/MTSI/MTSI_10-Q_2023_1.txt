NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Unaudited Interim Financial Information —The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to the rules and regulations of the United States (the “U.S.”) Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the condensed consolidated balance sheets, condensed consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc. (“MACOM”, the “Company”, “us”, “we” or “our”) for the periods presented. We prepare our interim financial information using the same accounting principles we use for our annual audited consolidated financial statements. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the annual audited consolidated financial statements have been condensed or omitted in accordance with prescribed SEC rules. We believe that the disclosures made in our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022 is as reported in our audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. Our accounting policies are described in the notes to our September 30, 2022 consolidated financial statements, which were included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 filed with the SEC on November 14, 2022 (the “2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K”). We recommend that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Principles of Consolidation —The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to the last day of September. Fiscal years 2023 and 2022 each include 52 weeks. To offset the effect of holidays, for fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, we include the extra week arising in such fiscal years in the first fiscal quarter.
Use of Estimates —The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities during the reporting periods, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we base estimates and assumptions on historical experience, currently available information and various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. The accounting policies which our management believes involve the most significant application of judgment or involve complex estimation, are inventories and associated reserves; revenue reserves; share-based compensation valuations and income taxes.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements —Our Recent Accounting Pronouncements are described in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Pronouncements for Adoption in Subsequent Periods The FASB issued ASU 2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , amended by ASU 2022-06,
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 , which provides optional expedients and exceptions to applying the guidance on contract modifications, hedge accounting, and other transactions, to simplify the accounting for transitioning from the London Interbank Offered Rate, and other interbank offered rates expected to be discontinued, to alternative reference rates. The guidance in this update was effective upon its issuance. If elected, the guidance is to be applied prospectively through December 31, 2024. We are currently evaluating the effect the potential adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements, including, but not limited to, our Credit Agreement (defined below). For additional information regarding our Credit Agreement, refer to
Note 8 - Debt. 2.
REVENUE Disaggregation of Revenue
We disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers by markets and geography, as we believe it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.
6 The following tables present our revenue disaggregated by markets and geography (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Revenue by Market: Telecommunications $ 61,450   $ 55,822   Industrial & Defense 77,169   73,146   Data Center 41,485   30,652   Total
$ 180,104   $ 159,620   Three Months Ended December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Revenue by Geographic Region: United States $ 88,589   $ 74,426   China 41,156   36,063   Asia Pacific, excluding China
(1) 21,534   30,650   Other Countries
(2) 28,825   18,481   Total $ 180,104   $ 159,620   (1) Asia Pacific primarily represents Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. (2) No country or region represented greater than 10% of our total revenue as of the dates presented, other than the United States, China and Asia Pacific region as presented above. Contract Balances
We record contract assets or contract liabilities depending on the timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections on a contract-by-contract basis. Our contract liabilities primarily relate to deferred revenue, including advanced consideration received from customers for contracts prior to the transfer of control to the customer, and therefore revenue is subsequently recognized upon delivery of products and services.
The following table presents the changes in contract liabilities during the three months ended December 30, 2022 (in thousands, except percentage): December 30, 2022 September 30, 2022 $ Change % Change  Contract liabilities $ 3,404   $ 3,916   $ ( 512 ) ( 13 ) % During the three months ended December 30, 2022, we recognized sales of $ 1.4
million that were included in the contract liabilities balance as of the beginning of the period. The decrease in contract liabilities during the three months ended December 30, 2022 was primarily related to recognition of revenue that was previously deferred for products and services invoiced prior to when certain of our customers obtained control of such products and/or services . 3.
INVESTMENTS All investments are short-term in nature and are invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper and are classified as available-for-sale.
The amortized cost, gross unrealized holding gains or losses and fair value of our available-for-sale investments by major investment type are summarized in the tables below (in thousands):   December 30, 2022   Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Holding Gains
Gross Unrealized Holding Losses Aggregate Fair Value Corporate bonds $ 146,334   $ 7   $ ( 3,707 ) $ 142,634   Commercial paper 326,614   32   ( 703 ) 325,943   Total short-term investments $ 472,948   $ 39   $ ( 4,410 ) $ 468,577   7 September 30, 2022   Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Holding Gains
Gross Unrealized Holding Losses Aggregate Fair Value Corporate bonds $ 146,163   $ 5   $ ( 4,492 ) $ 141,676   Commercial paper 326,318   —   ( 1,414 ) 324,904   Total short-term investments $ 472,481   $ 5   $ ( 5,906 ) $ 466,580        The contractual maturities of available-for-sale investments were as follows (in thousands):   December 30, 2022 September 30, 2022 Less than one year $ 358,416   $ 368,141   Over one year 110,161   98,439   Total available-for-sale investments $ 468,577   $ 466,580   We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities as of December 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 are temporary in nature and/or do not relate to credit loss, and therefore there is no expense for credit losses recorded in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity within accumulated other comprehensive income. During the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Interest income (expense), net included interest income on short-term investments of $ 3.7
million and $ 0.3
million, respectively. Other Investments
— As of December 30, 2022, we held a non-marketable equity investment in Series B preferred stock of a privately held manufacturing corporation with preferred liquidation rights over other equity shares. As the equity securities do not have a readily determinable fair value and do not qualify for the practical expedient under Accounting Standards Codification 820,
Fair Value Measurement,
we have elected to account for this investment at cost less any impairment. We evaluate this investment for impairment at each balance sheet date. As of December 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the carrying value of this investment was $ 2.5
million and it was classified as a long-term investment.
On December 23, 2021, we sold our non-controlling investment of less than
10 % in the outstanding equity of a private company to one of the other limited liability company members, pursuant to the terms of a previously negotiated call option included in the private company’s limited liability company agreement, as amended and restated (the “LLC Agreement”), in exchange for a predetermined fixed price as set forth in the LLC Agreement of approximately $ 127.8
million in cash consideration. As of December 23, 2021, the carrying value of this investment was approximately $ 9.5
million. As a result of this transaction, during the three months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a gain of $ 118.2
million in Other (expense) income, net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
4.
FAIR VALUE We group our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded, and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are:
Level 1
- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
- Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated with, observable market data. Level 3
- Fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including assumptions and judgments made by us. Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis such as our financial instruments. There have been no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 assets or liabilities during the three months ended December 30, 2022. 8 Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the following (in thousands): December 30, 2022 Fair Value Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets Money market funds $ 29,448   $ 29,448   $ —   $ —   Commercial paper 325,943   —   325,943   —   Corporate bonds 142,634   —   142,634   —   Total assets measured at fair value $ 498,025   $ 29,448   $ 468,577   $ —   September 30, 2022 Fair Value Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets Money market funds $ 1,392   $ 1,392   $ —   $ —   Commercial paper 324,904   —   324,904   —   Corporate bonds 141,676   —   141,676   —   Total assets measured at fair value $ 467,972   $ 1,392   $ 466,580   $ —   5.

2.25 % term loans due May 2024 $ 120,766   6.32   % $ 120,766   4.77   % 0.25 % convertible notes due March 2026 450,000   0.54   % 450,000   0.54   % Total principal amount outstanding 570,766   570,766   Less: Unamortized discount on term loans and deferred financing costs ( 4,434 ) ( 4,846 ) Total long-term debt $ 566,332   $ 565,920   10 Term Loans As of December 30, 2022, we are party to a credit agreement, dated as of May 8, 2014, with a syndicate of lenders and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent (as amended on February 13, 2015, August 31, 2016, March 10, 2017, May 19, 2017, May 2, 2018 and May 9, 2018, the “Credit Agreement”).
As of December 30, 2022, the Credit Agreement consisted of term loans with an initial aggregate principal amount of $ 700.0
million (the “Term Loans”) that will mature in May 2024 and bear interest at: (i) for LIBOR loans for any interest period, a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate as determined by the administrative agent, plus an applicable margin of
2.25 %; and (ii) for base rate loans, a rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) the prime rate quoted in the print edition of the Wall Street Journal, Money Rates Section, (b) the federal funds rate plus one-half of 1.00% and (c) the LIBOR rate applicable to a one-month interest period plus
1.00 % (but, in each case, not less than
1.00 %), plus an applicable margin of
1.25 %. As of December 30, 2022, there are no minimum principal repayments on the Term Loans until May 2024 when the remaining principal balance of $ 120.8
million becomes due. The fair value of the Term Loans was estimated to be approximately $ 119.6
million and $ 120.2
million as of December 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively, and was determined using Level 2 inputs, including a quoted price from a financial institution. As of December 30, 2022, approximately $ 0.5
million of deferred financing costs remain unamortized related to the Term Loans and is recorded as a direct reduction of the recognized debt liabilities in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Term Loans are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets and provide that we must comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants. 2026 Convertible Notes On March 25, 2021, we issued
0.25 % convertible senior notes due in fiscal year 2026, pursuant to an indenture dated as of such date (the “Indenture”), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, with an aggregate principal amount of $ 400.0
million (the “Initial Notes”), and on April 6, 2021, we issued an additional $ 50.0  million aggregate principal amount (the “Additional Notes”) (together, the “2026 Convertible Notes”). The aggregate principal balance of the 2026 Convertible Notes is $ 450.0  million. The 2026 Convertible Notes will mature on March 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The Additional Notes were issued and sold to the initial purchaser of the Initial Notes, pursuant to the option to purchase the Additional Notes granted by the Company to the initial purchaser and have the same terms as the Initial Notes. Holders of the 2026 Convertible Notes may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2025 in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, only under the following circumstances: (i) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on July 2, 2021 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least
20
trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of
30
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to
130 % of the conversion price for the notes on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the
five
business day period after any
five
consecutive trading day period (the “Measurement Period”) in which the “trading price” (as defined in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was
less than
98 % of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the notes on each such trading day; (iii) if we call such notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the applicable redemption date; or (iv) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events described in the Indenture. On or after December 15, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. The initial conversion rate for the 2026 Convertible Notes is 12.1767 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 82.12
per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events in the Indenture. In November 2021, we made an irrevocable election to pay cash for the aggregate principal amount of notes to be converted. Upon conversion of the 2026 Convertible Notes,
we are required to pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted
(subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the Indenture). We may not redeem the notes prior to March 20, 2024. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at our option, on or after March 20, 2024 if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock has been at least
130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least
20
trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day
11 immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, during any
30
consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, at a redemption price equal to
100 % of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to, but not including, the redemption date. The Indenture does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the making of investments, the incurrence of indebtedness or the purchase or prepayment of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries. In connection with the adoption of ASU 2020-06,
Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity,
on October 2, 2021 we reclassified $ 72.2  million, consisting of $ 73.1  million of principal and issuance costs of $ 0.9  million, previously allocated to the conversion feature, from additional paid-in capital to long-term debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of October 2, 2021. The reclassification was recorded to combine the two legacy units of account into a single instrument classified as a liability. We also recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $ 7.5  million to accumulated deficit on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of October 2, 2021, that was primarily driven by the derecognition of interest expense related to the accretion of the Debt Discount as required under the legacy accounting guidance. Under ASU 2020-06, we will no longer incur non-cash interest expense related to the accretion of the debt discount associated with the embedded conversion option. For the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, total interest expense for the 2026 Convertible Notes was $ 0.3
million. The
fair value of our 2026 Convertible Notes, including the conversion feature, was
$ 448.4
million
and
$ 411.4
million
as of
December 30, 2022
and
September 30, 2022, respectively,
and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input. There are
no
future minimum principal payments under the notes as of
December 30, 2022; the full amount of $ 450.0
million is due in fiscal year 2026. 9.
F INANCING OBLIGATION We are party to a power purchase agreement for the use of electric power and thermal energy producing systems at our fabrication facility in Lowell, Massachusetts. T hese systems are expected to reduce our consumption of energy while delivering sustainable, resilient energy for heating and cooling. We do not own these systems; however, we control the use of the assets during operation. As of December 30, 2022 and
September 30, 2022 , the net book value of the systems in Property and equipment, net was $ 9.3  million and $ 9.8
million, respectively, and the corresponding liability was $ 9.7  million and $ 9.8
million, respectively, primarily classified in Financing obligation on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The financing obligation was calculated based on future fixed payments allocated to the power generator of $ 16.8  million over the
15-year
term, discounted at an implied discount rate of
7.4 %, and the remaining future minimum payments are for power purchases. In total, we have $ 27.2  million in fixed payments associated with the power purchase agreement, which has a
15-year
term. As of December 30, 2022, expected future minimum payments for the financing obligation were as follows (in thousands): Fiscal year ending: Amount 2023 $ 699   2024 958   2025 982   2026 1,007   2027 1,031   Thereafter 11,914   Total payments $ 16,591   Less: interest 6,865   Present value of liabilities $ 9,726   12 10.
EARNINGS PER SHARE The following table sets forth the computation for basic and diluted net income per share of common stock (in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Numerator: Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 29,519   $ 138,827   Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding-basic 70,481   69,400   Dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units 893   1,824   Weighted average common shares outstanding-diluted 71,374   71,224   Net income to common stockholders per share-Basic: $ 0.42   $ 2.00   Net income to common stockholders per share-Diluted: $ 0.41   $ 1.95   The 2026 Convertible Notes did not have an impact on diluted net income per share for the three months ended December 30, 2022 or December 31, 2021.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES From time to time, we may be subject to commercial disputes, employment issues, claims by other companies in the industry that we have infringed their intellectual property rights and other similar claims and litigation. Any such claims may lead to future litigation and material damages and defense costs. We were not involved in any material pending legal proceedings during the three months ended December 30, 2022. 12. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION We have authorized
10
million shares of $ 0.001
par value preferred stock and
300
million shares of $ 0.001
par value common stock as of December 30, 2022. Stock Plans As of December 30, 2022, we had
4.6
million shares available for issuance under our 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”), which replaced our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as amended and restated) (the “2012 Plan”), and
1.3
million shares available for issuance under our 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Employee Stock Purchase Plan”), which replaced our 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We have outstanding awards under the 2021 Plan and the 2012 Plan. Following the adoption of the 2021 Plan, no additional awards have been or will be made under the 2012 Plan. Under the 2021 Plan, we have the ability to issue incentive stock options (“ISOs”), non-statutory stock options (“NSOs”), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), unrestricted stock awards, stock units (including restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”)), performance awards, cash awards, and other share-based awards to employees, directors, consultants and advisors. The ISOs and NSOs must be granted at an exercise price, and the SARs must be granted at a base value, per share of not less than 100% of the closing price of a share of our common stock on the date of grant (or, if no closing price is reported on that date, the closing price on the immediately preceding date on which a closing price was reported) (110% in the case of certain ISOs). Options granted under the 2012 Plan primarily vested based on certain market-based and performance-based criteria and generally have a term of
four years
to
seven years . Certain of the share-based awards granted and outstanding as of December 30, 2022 are subject to accelerated vesting upon a change in control of the Company. Incentive Stock Units Outside of the equity plans described above, we also grant incentive stock units (“ISUs”) to certain of our international employees which typically vest over
three
or
four years
and for which the fair value is determined by our underlying stock price, which are classified as liabilities and settled in cash upon vesting.
As of December 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the fair value of outstanding ISUs was $ 5.4  million and $ 4.9  million, respectively, and the associated accrued compensation liability was $ 2.5  million and $ 3.6  million, respectively. During the three
13 months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we recorded an expense for ISU awards of $ 1.3  million and $ 1.4  million, respectively. These expenses are not included in the share-based compensation expense totals below. Share-Based Compensation The following table shows a summary of share-based compensation expense included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):   Three Months Ended   December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cost of revenue $ 1,150   $ 1,033   Research and development 4,232   3,599   Selling, general and administrative 5,665   5,317   Total share-based compensation expense
$ 11,047   $ 9,949   As of December 30, 2022, the total unrecognized compensation costs related to RSAs, RSUs and PRSUs was $ 76.8
million, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of
2.3
years. As of December 30, 2022, total unrecognized compensation cost related to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan was $ 0.9
million. Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards A summary of stock award activity for the three months ended December 30, 2022 is as follows: Number of shares (in thousands) Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value  Balance as of September 30, 2022 1,872   $ 40.44   Granted 669   62.31   Performance-based adjustment (1) 311   27.13   Vested and released ( 1,126 ) 28.78   Forfeited, canceled or expired ( 7 ) 45.15   Balance as of December 30, 2022 1,719   $ 54.17   (1) The amount shown represents performance adjustments for performance-based awards. These were granted in prior fiscal years and vested during the three months ended December 30, 2022 based on the Company’s achievement of adjusted earnings per share performance conditions. Stock awards that vested during the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 had combined fair values of $ 66.8
million and $ 69.9
million, respectively, as of the vesting date. RSUs granted generally vest over a period of
three
or
four years . We granted
166,452
market-based PRSUs during the three months ended December 30, 2022, at a weighted average grant date fair value of $ 80.38
per share, and
none
were forfeited. Recipients may earn between 0% and 200% of the target number of shares based on the Company’s achievement of total stockholder return in comparison to a peer group of companies in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (^SOX) over a period of approximately
3
years. The fair value of the awards was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation and compensation expense is recognized ratably over the service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards subject to the market condition. The expected volatility of the Company’s common stock was estimated based on the historical average volatility rate over the three-year period. The dividend yield assumption was based on historical and anticipated dividend payouts. The risk-free rate assumption was based on observed interest rates consistent with the three-year measurement period.
The assumptions used to value the awards are as follows: Three Months Ended December 30, 2022 Grant date stock price $ 56.15 Average stock price at the start of the performance period $ 54.12 Risk free interest rate 4.2 % Years to maturity 2.90 Expected volatility rate 52.4 % Expected dividend yield — 14 Stock Options As of December 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, there were
15,000
stock options outstanding with a weighted-average exercise price per share of $ 16.06 . As of December 30, 2022, the weighted-average remaining contractual term was
2.85
years and the aggregate intrinsic value was $ 0.7
million. Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between our closing stock price on December 30, 2022 and the exercise price of outstanding, in-the-money options. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 11.0
million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. There were
no
options exercised during the three months ended December 30, 2022. 13.
INCOME TAXES We are subject to income tax in the U.S. as well as other tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Earnings from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may also be subject to current U.S. income tax. For interim periods, we record a tax provision or benefit based upon the estimated effective tax rate expected for the full fiscal year, adjusted for material discrete taxation matters arising during the interim periods. Our quarterly tax provision or benefit, and its quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate, are subject to significant variation due to several factors. These factors include items such as: variability in accurately predicting pre-tax income/loss, the mix of jurisdictions in which we operate, intercompany transactions, changes in how we do business, tax law developments, the realizability of our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance, and relative changes in permanent tax benefits or expenses. The provision for income taxes and effective income tax rate are as follows (in thousands, except percentages): Three Months Ended December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Income tax expense $ 9,611   $ 1,457   Effective income tax rate 24.6   % 1.0   % The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of
21 % and our effective income tax rate for the three months ended December 30, 2022, was primarily driven by tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), non-deductible compensation and state income taxes partially offset by income taxed in foreign jurisdictions generally at lower tax rates, and research and development (“R&D”) tax credits. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% and our effective income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by the full valuation allowance against any expense associated with income in the U.S. and income taxed in foreign jurisdictions generally at lower tax rates, where a valuation allowance does not apply.
On September 30, 2022, we released the majority of the valuation allowances against U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets including operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards, R&D tax credit carryforwards and other deferred tax items relating to temporary differences. We continued our ongoing assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets and did not note any significant changes from our assessment on September 30, 2022. We continue to maintain a partial valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets primarily relating to state NOLs and R&D tax credit carryforwards which are not expected to be realized. We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making this determination, we consider available positive and negative evidence. We look at factors that may impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets including results of recent operations, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies.
There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022. It is our policy to recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2022, we did not make any accrual or payment of interest or penalties. 15 14.
SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION The following is a summary of supplemental cash flow information for the periods presented (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash paid for interest $ 2,258   $ 1,197   Cash paid for income taxes $ 297   $ 178   Non-cash activities: Operating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities $ 1,305   $ 280   Additions to property and equipment, net included in liabilities $ 1,364   $ 1,618   During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we capitalized $ 0.5  million of non-cash costs to property and equipment associated with construction of a power generator that were paid by our service provider and included in non-cash capital expenditures above. See
Note 9 - Financing Obligation . 15.
GEOGRAPHIC AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER INFORMATION We have
one
reportable operating segment that designs, develops, manufactures and markets semiconductors and modules. The determination of the number of reportable operating segments is based on the chief operating decision maker’s (“CODM”) use of financial information provided for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. The Company's CODM is its President and Chief Executive Officer. In evaluating financial performance and making operating decisions, the CODM primarily uses consolidated metrics. The Company assesses its determination of operating segments at least annually. We continue to evaluate our internal reporting structure and the potential impact of any changes on our segment reporting.

COVID-19 Impact COVID-19 has spread throughout areas of the world where we operate and resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus. As a result of these measures and the spread of COVID-19, we have modified our business practices and may further modify our practices as required, or as we determine appropriate. While these measures, as well as other disruptions, have impacted our operations, the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers, such impacts did not, through the three months ended December 30, 2022, have a material impact on our consolidated operating results. However, the degree to which COVID-19 may impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows will continue to depend on future developments, which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 17 For additional information on risk factors that could impact our future results, please refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Description of Our Revenue Revenue.
Our revenue is derived from sales of high-performance RF, microwave, millimeter wave, optical and photonic semiconductor products. We design, integrate, manufacture and package differentiated, semiconductor-based products that we sell to customers through our direct sales organization, our network of independent sales representatives and our distributors.
We believe the primary drivers of our future revenue growth will include: • continued growth in the demand for high-performance analog, digital and optical semiconductors in our three primary markets; • introducing new products using advanced technologies, added features, higher levels of integration and improved performance;
• increasing content of our semiconductor solutions in customers’ systems through cross-selling our product lines; • leveraging our core strength and leadership position in standard, catalog products that service all of our end applications; and • engaging early with our lead customers to develop custom and standard products. Our core strategy is to develop and innovate high-performance products that address our customers’ most difficult technical challenges in our primary markets: Telecom, I&D and Data Center. We expect our revenue in the Telecom market to be driven by 5G deployments, with continued upgrades and expansion of communications equipment, and increasing adoption of our high-performance RF, millimeter wave, optical and photonic components. We expect our revenue in the I&D market to be driven by the expanding product portfolio that we offer which services applications such as test and measurement, satellite communications, civil and military radar, industrial, automotive, scientific and medical applications, further supported by growth in applications for our multi-market catalog products. We expect our revenue in the Data Center market to be driven by the adoption of cloud-based services and the upgrade of data center architectures to 100G, 200G, 400G and 800G interconnects, which we expect will drive adoption of higher speed optical and photonic components.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimate s Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and could be material if our actual or expected experience were to change unexpectedly. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our estimates and judgments.
We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result. The accounting policies which our management believes involve the most significant application of judgment or involve complex estimation, are inventories and associated reserves; revenue reserves; share-based compensation valuations and income taxes.

Revenue.
Our revenue increased by $20.5 million, or 12.8%, to $180.1 million for the three months ended December 30, 2022, from $159.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in revenue in the three months ended December 30, 2022 is described by end market in the following paragraphs. Revenue from our primary markets, the percentage of change between the periods presented, and revenue by primary markets expressed as a percentage of total revenue in the periods presented were (in thousands, except percentages):   Three Months Ended     December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 % Change Telecom $ 61,450 $ 55,822 10.1  % Industrial & Defense 77,169 73,146 5.5  % Data Center 41,485 30,652 35.3  % Total $ 180,104 $ 159,620 12.8  % Telecom 34.1  % 35.0  % Industrial & Defense 42.9  % 45.8  % Data Center 23.0  % 19.2  % Total 100.0  % 100.0  % In the three months ended December 30, 2022, our Telecom market revenue increased by $5.6 million, or 10.1%, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase for the three months ended December 30, 2022 was primarily driven by an increase in RF and microwave products for metro long-haul broadband access and video infrastructure, products targeted for carrier-based optical semiconductor products and non-recurring license revenue of $2.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in sales of legacy products. In the three months ended December 30, 2022, our I&D market revenue increased by $4.0 million, or 5.5%, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the three months ended December 30, 2022 was primarily related to ongoing defense program shipments and expansion of high-performance analog product lines into the I&D market. 20 In the three months ended December 30, 2022, our Data Center market revenue increased by $10.8 million, or 35.3%, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the three months ended December 30, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in sales of our high-performance analog Data Center products and certain legacy products which were supply constrained in prior periods, partially offset by a decrease in sales of optical semiconductor products.
Gross profit.
Gross margin was 61.3% and 59.0% for the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Gross profit was $110.4 million and $94.1 million for the three months ended December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Gross profit increased for the three months ended December 30, 2022 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of higher sales, including $2.0 million of license revenue, favorable revenue mix, production efficiencies, lower intangible amortization, partially offset by increases in production supplies, employee headcount and employee-related costs.
Research and development.
Research and development expense increased by $3.4 million, or 9.5%, to $38.8 million, or 21.6% of our revenue, for the three months ended December 30, 2022, compared to $35.5 million, or 22.2% of our revenue, for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Research and development expense increased in the three months ended December 30, 2022 primarily as a result of an increase in employee headcount, employee-related costs, share-based compensation expense, development foundry costs and a loss on disposal of equipment. Selling, general and administrative.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $1.3 million, or 4.2%, to $32.9 million, or 18.3% of our revenue, for the three months ended December 30, 2022, compared to $31.6 million, or 19.8% of our revenue, for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Selling, general and administrative expense increased in the three months ended December 30, 2022 primarily due to an increase in outside professional fees, share-based compensation expense and variable costs, partially offset by a decrease in intangible amortization.
Interest income (expense), net .
In the three months ended December 30, 2022, interest income, net
was
$0.6 million, or 0.3% of our revenue, compared to interest expense, net of $1.7 million, or 1.1% of our revenue, for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The change for the three months ended December 30, 2022 is primarily due to an increase in interest income on short-term investments and an increase in short-term investments, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on the Term Loans. Other (expense) income, net.
In the
three months ended
December 30, 2022, o ther expense, net was $0.1 million , or less than 0.1% of our revenue, compared to other income, net of $114.9 million, or 72.0% of our revenue, for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The three months ended December 31, 2021 includes a gain on the sale of our equity method investment of $118.2 million and net losses of $3.3 million associated with such equity method investment. See
Note 3 - Investments
to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a dditional information. Provision for income taxes.
Our income tax expense and effective income tax rates for the periods indicated were (in thousands, except percentages): Three Months Ended December 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Income tax expense 9,611  1,457  Effective income tax rate 24.6  % 1.0  % The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% and our effective income tax rate for the three months ended December 30, 2022, was primarily driven by tax on GILTI, non-deductible compensation and state income taxes partially offset by income taxed in foreign jurisdictions generally at lower tax rates, and R&D tax credits. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% and our effective income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by the full valuation allowance against any expense associated with income in the U.S. and income taxed in foreign jurisdictions generally at lower tax rates, where a valuation allowance does not apply. Our estimated annual effective tax rate for the year ending September 29, 2023 is expected to be
approximately 30% , adjusted for discrete taxation matters arising during the interim periods.

Adjustments to reconcile our net income to cash provided by operating activities primarily included depreciation and intangible amortization expense of $12.9 million, share-based compensation expense of $11.0 million and deferred income tax expense of $9.1 million.
In addition, cash used in operating assets and liabilities was $23.8 million for the three months ended December 30, 2022, primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable of $10.5 million, an increase in inventories of $6.4 million and a decrease of $10.3 million in accrued and other liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $3.7 million. Our cash flow from operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2021 of $34.1 million consisted of a net income of $138.8 million, less adjustments to reconcile our net income to cash provided by operating activities of $88.4 million and cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $16.3 million. Adjustments to reconcile our net income to cash provided by operating activities primarily included a net gain of $114.9 million related to the sale of our equity method investment offset by equity method investment losses, depreciation and intangible amortization expense of $15.2 million and share-based compensation expense of $9.9 million. In addition, cash used in operating assets and liabilities was $16.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable of $12.9 million and an increase in inventories of $5.8 million. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Our cash flow used in investing activities for the three months ended December 30, 2022 of $8.0 million consisted primarily of purchases of $145.3 million of short-term investments and capital expenditures of $9.6 million, offset by proceeds of $147.0 million for the sale and maturity of short-term investments. Our cash flow provided by investing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2021 of $105.7 million consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of our equity method investment of $127.8 million, proceeds of $58.5 million for the sale and maturity of short-term investments, offset by purchases of $75.4 million of short-term investments and capital expenditures of $5.1 million.

Note 3 - Investments
to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Cash Flow from Financing Activities During the three months ended December 30, 2022, our cash used in financing activities of $24.3 million was primarily related to $26.4 million of repurchases of common stock associated with employee tax withholdings on vested equity awards, partially offset by $2.3 million of proceeds from employee stock purchases. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, our cash used in financing activities of $22.9 million was primarily related to $27.8 million of repurchases of stock associated with employee tax withholdings on vested equity awards, partially offset by
$5.1 million of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases. 22 Liquidity As of December 30, 2022, we held $126.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, primarily deposited with financial institutions, as well as $468.6 million of liquid short-term investments. The undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries are considered indefinitely reinvested for the periods presented and we do not intend to repatriate such earnings. We believe the decision to reinvest these earnings will not have a significant impact on our liquidity. As of December 30, 2022, cash held by our indefinitely reinvested foreign subsidiaries was $14.1 million, which, along with cash generated from foreign operations, is expected to be used in the support of international growth and working capital requirements as well as the repayment of certain intercompany loans.
We plan to use our remaining available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments for general corporate purposes, including working capital, or for the acquisition of or investment in complementary technologies, design teams, products and businesses. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We may need to raise additional capital from time to time through the issuance and sale of equity or debt securities, and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. As of December 30, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. For additional information related to our Liquidity and Capital Resources, see

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business, which consists primarily of interest rate risk associated with our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and our variable rate debt, as well as foreign exchange rate risk.
Interest rate risk.
The primary objectives of our investment activity are to preserve principal, provide liquidity and invest excess cash for an average rate of return. To minimize market risk, we maintain our portfolio in cash and diversified investments, which may consist of corporate bonds, bank deposits, money market funds and commercial paper. The interest rates are variable and fluctuate with current market conditions. The risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to this investment portfolio. We believe that a 10% change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.   Our exposure to interest rate risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on the outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement. The interest rates on our Term Loans are variable interest rates based on our lender’s prime rate or a LIBOR rate, in each case plus an applicable margin, which exposes us to market interest rate risk when we have outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. As of December 30, 2022, we had $120.8 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Assuming our outstanding debt remains constant under the Credit Agreement for an entire year and the applicable annual interest rate increases or decreases by 1%, our annual interest expense would increase or decrease by $1.2 million. The interest rates on our 2026 Convertible Notes are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate risk. Foreign currency risk.
To date, our international customer agreements have been denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. The functional currency of a majority of our foreign operations continues to be in U.S. dollars with the remaining operations being local currency. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact demand in certain regions, reduce or delay customer orders, or otherwise negatively affect how customers do business with us. The effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets of the majority of our operations are accounted for as transaction gains or losses. We believe that a change of 10% in such foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In the future, we may enter into foreign currency exchange hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to changes in exchange rates. 23 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective as of December 30, 2022. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Controls Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. Similarly, an evaluation of controls cannot provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 24 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS See
