SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This
report contains forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are contained principally in the section captioned “Risk
Factors,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” These
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements
to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors described in the section captioned “Risk Factors”
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 filed with the SEC on September 28, 2022. In some cases, you
can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,”
“expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,”
“projects,” “should,” “would,” and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks
and uncertainties. You should read these factors and the other cautionary statements made in this report and in the documents we incorporate
by reference into this report as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report or the
documents we incorporate by reference into this report. If one or more of these factors materialize, or if any underlying assumptions
prove incorrect, our actual results, performance or achievements may vary materially from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Given
these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include,
among other things, statements relating to:
●
to date
we have not generated sufficient cash to fund our operations. At December 31, 2022, we had a cash balance of $157,000 and an accumulated
deficit of $85.6 million. Our operating plan and forecast include a number of estimates and assumptions including our ability to
execute our proposed plans, to generate revenue from our current backlog, to increase both revenue and gross profit, to implement
cost reductions and to maintain access to financing under existing debt agreements. If we are not successful in executing our plans
as expected, our ability to continue as a going concern will be adversely affected;
●
our
ability to secure sufficient funding to support our current and proposed operations, which could be more difficult considering the
negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, customer demand and supply chain, difficult stock market conditions as
well as investor sentiment regarding our industry and our stock;
●
our
ability to manage our working capital requirements efficiently;
●
our
ability to maintain our credit facilities and obtain the necessary funds as needed;
●
our
ability to maintain effective internal controls, our ability to record, process and report financial information timely and accurately
could be adversely affected and could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements, which could subject us to litigation
or investigations, require management resources, increase our expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements
and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.
●
our
ability to realize revenue from the current backlog is dependent on among other things, the delivery of key parts from our vendors
in a timely manner. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results, and existing orders may be cancelled, modified or
otherwise altered by customers. We can provide no assurance as to the profitability of the contracts reflected in our backlog;
●
our
ability to obtain raw materials and other supplies for our products at existing or competitive prices and on a timely basis, particularly
considering the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and inflation on our suppliers and supply chain;
●
our
anticipated growth strategies and our ability to manage the expansion of our business operations effectively;
3
●
our
ability to maintain or increase our market share in the competitive markets in which we do business;
●
our
ability to grow our revenue, increase our gross profit margin and become a profitable business;
●
our
ability to fulfill our backlog of open sales orders given delays in the receipt of key component parts and other potential manufacturing
disruptions posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and general supply chain issues;
●
our
ability to keep up with rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards, including our ability to achieve technological
advances;
●
our
dependence on the growth in demand for our products;
●
our
ability to compete with larger companies with far greater resources than we have;
●
our
ability to shift to new suppliers and incorporate new components into our products in a manner that is not disruptive to our business;
●
our
ability to obtain and maintain UL Listings and OEM approvals for our energy storage solutions;
●
our
ability to diversify our product offerings and capture new market opportunities;
●
our
ability to source our needs for skilled labor, machinery, parts, and raw materials economically;
●
our
ability to attract and retain key members of our senior management;
●
our
ability to continue to operate safely and effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic; and
●
our
dependence on few major customers.
Also,
forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. You should read this report and
the documents that we reference, and file as exhibits to this report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results
may be materially different from what we expect. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements
publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, even
if new information becomes available in the future.

NOTE
1 -
NATURE OF BUSINESS
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
applicable to interim reports of companies filing as a smaller reporting company. These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2022 filed with the SEC on September 28, 2022. In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated interim
financial statements include all adjustments necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading. The results of operations
for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other future period. Certain
notes to the financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for
the most recent fiscal year as reported in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K have been omitted. The accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2022 has been derived from the audited balance sheet at June 30, 2022 contained in such Form 10-K.
Nature
of Business
Flux
Power Holdings, Inc. (“Flux”) was incorporated in 2008 in the State of Nevada, and Flux’s operations are conducted
through its wholly owned subsidiary, Flux Power, Inc. (“Flux Power”), a California corporation (collectively, the “Company”).
We
design, develop, manufacture, and sell a portfolio of advanced lithium-ion energy storage solutions for electrification of a range of
industrial commercial sectors which include material handling, airport ground support equipment (“GSE”), and stationary energy
storage. We believe our mobile and stationary energy storage solutions provide customers with a reliable, high performing, cost effective,
and more environmentally friendly alternative as compared to traditional lead acid and propane-based solutions. Our modular and scalable
design allows different configurations of lithium-ion battery packs to be paired with our proprietary wireless battery management system
to provide the level of energy storage required and “state of the art” real time monitoring of pack performance. We believe
that the increasing demand for lithium-ion battery packs and more environmentally friendly energy storage solutions in the material handling
sector should continue to drive our revenue growth.
As
used herein, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Flux,” and “Company” mean Flux
Power Holdings, Inc., unless otherwise indicated. All dollar amounts herein are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The
Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in
the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. There have been no material changes in these
policies or their application.
Management
has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of the Company’s consolidated financial statements
and believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial
statements.

Net
Loss Per Common Share
The
Company calculates basic loss per common share by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the periods. Diluted loss per common share includes the impact from all dilutive potential common shares relating to outstanding convertible
securities.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, basic and diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding were
16,020,183
and
15,987,502 ,
respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, basic and diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding were
16,008,740
and
14,895,989 , respectively. The Company incurred a net loss for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and therefore, basic and diluted loss per share for the periods were the same because potential common share equivalent would have been
anti-dilutive. The total potentially dilutive common shares outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021 that were excluded from diluted
weighted-average common shares outstanding represent shares underlying outstanding convertible debt, stock options, RSUs, and warrants,
and totaled
2,608,505
and
2,092,851 , respectively.
At
December 31, 2022 and 2021 potentially dilutive common shares outstanding that were excluded from diluted weighted-average common shares
outstanding were as follows:

Considerations
The
accompanying financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. For the six months
ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company generated negative cash flows from operations of $ 1.9
million and
$ 23.9
million, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $ 85.6
million and $ 81.8
million, respectively. Management has evaluated
the Company’s expected cash requirements over the next twelve (12) months, including investments in additional sales and marketing
and research and development, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements. Management believes the Company’s existing
cash, funding available under the SVB Credit Facility and the subordinated line of credit (“Subordinated LOC”), expected improvements in the gross margin and lower cash
requirements will enable the Company to fund planned operations for the next twelve (12) months.
Historically,
the Company has not generated sufficient cash to fund its operations. The Company is continuing efforts to improve operational efficiencies
and to generate revenue from its existing backlog. Management currently anticipates increased revenues as well as improvements in the
Company’s gross margin over the next twelve (12) months. The Company has received new orders in the twelve-month period ended December
31, 2022, of approximately $ 62.4
million.
As
of February 6, 2023, the Company had a cash balance of $ 964,000 , $ 5.7
million remaining balance under the SVB Credit Facility and $ 4.0
million was available for future draws under the Subordinated LOC. As of February 6, 2023, $ 5.7
million remained available under the
Company’s ATM agreement. In addition, to support our operations and anticipated growth, we intend to explore additional sources
of capital as needed. We also continue to execute our cost reduction, sourcing, pricing recovery initiatives in efforts to increase our
gross margins and improve cash flow from operations. Any unforeseen factors in the general economy beyond management’s control
could potentially have negative impact on the planned gross margin improvement plan.

On
November 9, 2020, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (“Agreement”) with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”).
On
October 29, 2021, the Company entered into a First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (“First Amendment” and together

to, increasing the amount of the revolving line of credit from $ 4.0
million to $ 6.0
million, and extending the maturity date to
November
7, 2022 . The First Amendment provided the Company with a senior secured credit facility for up to $ 6.0
million available on a revolving
basis (“Revolving LOC”). Outstanding principal under the Revolving LOC accrued interest at a floating rate per annum equal
to the greater of
(i) Prime Rate plus two and a half percent (2.50%), or (ii) five and three-quarters percent (5.75%). The Company paid
a non-refundable commitment fee of $ 15,000
upon execution of the Agreement and an additional non-refundable commitment fee of $22,500
in connection with the First Amendment.
On
June 23, 2022, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (“Second Amendment” and together

, including but not limited to, (i) increasing the amount of the revolving line of credit to $8.0 million, (ii) changing the financial
covenants of the Company from one based on tangible net worth to another based on adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Second Amendment)
on a trailing six (6) month basis and liquidity ratio certified as of the end of each month pursuant to the calculations set forth therein,
and (iii) allowing for the assignment and transfer by SVB of all of its obligations, rights and benefits under the Agreement and Loan
Documents (as defined in the Agreement and except for the Warrants).
In
addition, under the Second Amendment, the interest rate terms for the outstanding principal under the Revolving LOC were amended to accrue
interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of either
(A) Prime Rate plus three and one-half of one percent (3.50%) or
(B) seven and one-half of one percent (7.50%). Interest payments are due monthly on the last day of the month. In addition, the Company
is required to pay a quarterly unused facility fee equal to one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) per annum of the average daily unused
portion of the $8.0 million commitment under the SVB Credit Facility, depending upon availability of borrowings under the Revolving LOC.
Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company paid SVB a non-refundable amendment fee of $ 5,000
and SVB’s legal fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Second Amendment.
In
connection with the Second Amendment, the Company issued a
twelve-year
warrant to SVB and its designee, SVB Financial Group, to purchase
up to
40,806
shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $ 2.23
per share pursuant to the terms set forth therein.

“Agreement”), including but not limited to, (i) increasing the amount of the SVB Credit Facility from $ 8.0
million
to $ 14.0
million,
(ii) removing the liquidity ratio financial covenant of the Company under Section 6.9 of the Third Amended Loan Agreement, (iii)
amending the definition of Borrowing Base (as defined in the Fourth Amendment), which includes a new defined term for Net Orderly
Liquidation Value (as defined in the Fourth Amendment), and (iv) removing certain defined liquidity terms under Section 13.1 of the
Third Amended Loan Agreement. (See Note 9 – Subsequent Events).
Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the Company paid SVB
a non-refundable amendment fee of $ 10,000
and
SVB’s legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Fourth Amendment.
The
Company has used the SVB Credit Facility to fund its operations and working capital requirements. Amounts outstanding under the
Revolving LOC are secured by substantially all tangible and intangible assets of the Company (including, without limitation,

Subordinated
Line of Credit Facility
On
May 11, 2022, the Company entered into a Credit Facility Agreement (the “Subordinated LOC”) with Cleveland Capital,
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“Cleveland”), Herndon Plant Oakley, Ltd., (“HPO”), and other lenders
(together with Cleveland and HPO, the “Lenders”). The Subordinated LOC provides the Company with a short-term line of
credit not less than $ 3,000,000
and not more than $ 5,000,000 ,
the proceeds of which shall be used by the Company for working capital purposes. In connection with the Subordinated LOC, the
Company issued a separate subordinated unsecured promissory note in favor of each respective Lender (each promissory note, a
“Note”) for each Lender’s commitment amount (each such commitment amount, a “Commitment Amount”). As
of December 31, 2022, the Lenders committed to an aggregate commitment of $ 4,000,000 .
Pursuant
to the terms of the Subordinated LOC, each Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, an “Advance”) up to such
Lender’s Commitment Amount to the Company from time to time, until December 31, 2022 (the “Due Date”). The Company
may, from time to time, prior to the Due Date, draw down, repay, and re-borrow on the Note, by giving notice to the Lenders of the amount
to be requested to be drawn down.
Each
Note bears an interest rate of
15.0 % per annum on each Advance from and after the date of disbursement of such Advance and is payable
on (i) the Due Date in cash or shares of common stock of the Company (the “Common Stock”) at the sole election of the Company,
unless such Due Date extended pursuant to the Note, or (ii) on occurrence of an event of Default (as defined in the Note). The Due Date
may be extended (i) at the sole election of the Company for one (1) additional year period from the Due Date upon the payment of a commitment
fee equal to two percent ( 2 %) of the Commitment Amount to the Lender within thirty (30) days prior to the original Due Date, or (ii)
by the Lender in writing. In addition, each Lender signed a Subordination Agreement by and between the Lenders and SVB dated as of May
11, 2022 (the “Subordination Agreement”) for the purposes of subordinating the right to payment under the Note to SVB’s
indebtedness by the Company now outstanding or hereinafter incurred. On December 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company elected
to extend the Due Date to December 31, 2023 and the Company paid the Lenders an extension fee in the aggregate amount of $ 80,000 .
12
The
Subordinated LOC includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company and the Lenders. The Company has also agreed
to pay the legal fees of Cleveland’s counsel in an amount up to $ 10,000 . In addition, each Note also provides that, upon the occurrence
of a Default, at the option of the Lender, the entire outstanding principal balance, all accrued but unpaid interest and/or Late Charges
(as defined in the Note) at once will become due and payable upon written notice to the Company by the Lender.
In
connection with entry into the Subordinated LOC, the Company paid to each Lender a one-time committee fee in cash equal to
3.5 % of such
Lender’s Commitment Amount. In addition, in consideration of the Lenders’ commitment to provide the Advances to the Company,
the Company issued the Lenders five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of
128,000
shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$ 2.53
per share that are, subject to certain ownership limitations, exercisable immediately (the “Warrants”)
(the number
of warrants issued to each Lender is equal to the product of (i) 160,000 shares of common stock multiplied by (ii) the ratio represented
by each Lender’s Commitment Amount divided by the $5,000,000).
Pursuant
to a selling agreement, dated as of May 11, 2022, the Company retained HPO as its placement agent in connection with the Subordinated
LOC. As compensation for services rendered in conjunction with the Subordinated LOC, the Company paid HPO a finder fee equal to
3 % of
the Commitment Amount from each such Lender placed by HPO in cash.

Stock-based
Compensation
Stock-based
compensation expense for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 represents the estimated fair value of stock options
and RSUs at the time of grant amortized under the straight-line method over the expected vesting period and reduced for estimated forfeitures
of options and RSUs. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
differ from original estimates. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable stock options was approximately $ 335,000 .

ITEM
2 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The
following discussion provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company’s
results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim condensed consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes thereto and Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial condition and Results
of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
Business
Overview
We
design, develop, manufacture, and sell a portfolio of advanced lithium-ion energy storage solutions for electrification of a range of
industrial commercial sectors which include material handling, airport ground support equipment (“GSE”), and other commercial
and industrial applications. We believe our mobile and stationary energy storage solutions provide our customers a reliable, high performing,
cost effective, and more environmentally friendly alternative as compared to traditional lead acid and propane-based solutions. Our modular
and scalable design allows different configurations of lithium-ion battery packs to be paired with our proprietary wireless battery management
system to provide the level of energy storage required and “state of the art” real time monitoring of pack performance. We
believe that the increasing demand for lithium-ion battery packs and more environmentally friendly energy storage solutions in the material
handling sector should continue to drive our revenue growth.
Our
long-term strategy is to meet the rapidly growing demand for lithium-ion energy solutions and to be the supplier of choice, targeting
large companies having demanding energy storage needs. We have established selling relationships equipment OEMs and customers with large
fleets of forklifts and GSEs. We intend to reach this goal by investing in research and development to expand our product mix, expanding
our sales and marketing efforts, improving our customer support efforts and continuing our efforts to improve production capacity and
efficiencies. Our research and development efforts will continue to focus on providing adaptable, reliable and cost-effective energy
storage solutions for our customers.
Our
largest sector of penetration thus far has been the material handling sector which we believe is a multi-billion dollar addressable market.
We believe the sector will provide us with an opportunity to grow our business as we enhance our product mix and service levels and grow
our sales to large fleets of forklifts and GSEs. Applications of our modular packs for other industrial and commercial uses, such as
solar energy storage, are providing additional growth opportunities. We intend to continue to expand our supply chain and customer partnerships
and seek further partnerships and/or acquisitions that provide synergy to meeting our growth and “building scale” objectives.

“Backlog”
represents the amount of anticipated revenues we may recognize in the future from existing contractual orders with customers that are
in progress and have not yet shipped. Backlog values may not be indicative of future operating results as orders may be cancelled, modified
or otherwise altered by customers. In addition, our ability to realize revenue from our backlog will be dependent on the delivery of
key parts from our suppliers and our ability to manufacture and ship our products to customers in a timely manner. There can be no assurance
that outstanding customer orders will be fulfilled as expected and that our backlog will result in future revenues.
As
of February 6, 2023, our order backlog was approximately $29.8 million .

Business
Updates
Supply
Chain Issues and Higher Procurement Costs
The
supply chain disruptions that started during the COVID-19 pandemic continue, notably with delivery delays at the ports of Los Angeles
and Long Beach. In addition, the price of steel and certain other electrical components used in our products have seen dramatic increases,
along with increased shipping costs. It is impossible to predict how long the current disruptions to the cost and availability of raw
materials and component parts will last. We implemented price increases on certain new product orders in October 2021 and April 2022
to offset rising global costs of raw materials and component parts. In addition, we increased our inventory of raw materials and component
parts to $19.5 million as of December 31, 2022 to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions and support timely deliveries. However,
there can be no assurance that our price increases, inventory levels or any future steps we take will be sufficient to offset the rising
procurement costs and manage sourcing of raw materials and component parts effectively.
To
address some of these negative consequences and to support the future growth of our business, we have implemented a number of new strategic
initiatives. Our first priority over the coming quarters is achieving “profitability,” specifically, cash flow breakeven.
Accordingly, we continue to focus our efforts on the following strategic initiatives:
○
Gross
margin improvements
●
Utilize
lower cost, more reliable, and secondary suppliers of key components including cells, steel, electronics, circuit boards and other
key components.
●
Actively
manage our suppliers to avoid supply chain disruptions and related risks.
●
Introduce
new designs, including a simplified “platform” that reduces part count, lowers cost, improves manufacturability and serviceability.
●
Focus
on ensuring profitability of all product lines by increasing prices where appropriate, discontinuing unprofitable lines and closely
managing our mix of products.
●
Seek
more competitive carriers to reduce shipping costs.
●
Implement
Lean Manufacturing process to enhance capacity utilization, efficiency, quality.
●
Introduce
comprehensive “cost of quality” initiative to ensure effective and robust processes.
●
Implement
“automated cell module assembly” to assemble purchased “individual” battery cells into a “module”
for the battery pack. This will enable lower inventory from simplified SKU count and lower costs.
○
Business
expansion to accelerate gross margin
●
Leverage
current high-profile “proven customer relationships” to respond to growing demand of large fleets for lithium-ion value
proposition.
●
Pursue
new markets that can leverage our technology and manufacturing capabilities.
●
Expand
features of our popular “SkyBMS” (telemetry) which provides customized fleet management, and real time reports.
●
Expand
our manufacturing and service capacities to ensure customer satisfaction from increased deliveries, and service.
●
Capitalize
on our leadership position with new offerings.
●
While
we are “agnostic to the type of lithium chemistry,” ensure our research to support other chemistries as they may become
available. Ensure we have leadership with our core technology, without dependence on purchasing critical technology.
There
can be no assurance that these initiatives and efforts will be successful.

Recent
Corporate Developments
Amendment
to Revolving Line of Credit with Silicon Valley Bank
On
January 10, 2023, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the “Fourth Amendment”) with Silicon
Valley Bank (“SVB”), which amended certain terms of the Loan and Security Agreement dated November 9, 2020, as amended on
October 29, 2021, as further amended on June 23, 2022, and as further amended on November 7, 2022 (together with the Fourth Amendment,
the “Agreement”), including but not limited to, (i) increasing the amount of the revolving line of credit from $8.0 million
to $14.0 million, (ii) removing the liquidity ratio financial covenant of the Company under Section 6.9 of the Agreement, (iii) amending
the definition of Borrowing Base (as defined in the Fourth Amendment), which includes a new defined term for Net Orderly Liquidation
Value (as defined in the Fourth Amendment), and (iv) removing certain defined liquidity terms under Section 13.1 of the Agreement. Pursuant
to the Fourth Amendment, we paid SVB a non-refundable amendment fee of $10,000 and SVB’s legal fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Fourth Amendment. We have used the SVB Credit Facility to fund our operations and working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance under
the Revolving LOC was approximately $6.8 million. As noted above, on January 10, 2023, the SVB Credit Facility was increased by $6.0
million.to $14.0 million and as of February 6, 2023, $5.7 million remaining balance for future draws through May 7, 2023, unless the
credit facility is renewed and its term is extended prior to its expiration. (See Note 9 – Subsequent Events)

Adjusted
EBITDA
Adjusted
EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking net income and adding back the expenses related to interest,
income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, each of which has been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted
EBITDA was a loss of approximately $2,432,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to a loss of $8,465,000 for the six
months ended December 31, 2021.
Management
believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with our results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information
about our period-over-period results. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides additional information with
respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and is also frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other
interested parties in the evaluation of comparable companies. We also rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a primary measure to review and assess
the operating performance of our company and our management team.
As
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, it should not be construed as a substitute for EBITDA and net income (loss) (as determined
in accordance with GAAP) for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance or financial position.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Overview
For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended June 30,
2022, we generated negative cash flows from operations of $1.9 million and $23.9 million, respectively. To date our business has not generated
sufficient cash to fund our operations. However, we believe that based on our ability to recognize revenue from our existing backlog,
we anticipate increased revenues as well as planned improvements in our gross margin over the next twelve (12) months. Our planned gross
margin improvement tasks continue to include, but is not limited to, a plan to drive bill of material costs down while increasing price
of our products for new orders. We have received new orders during the twelve (12) months period ended December 31, 2022, of approximately
$62.4 million.
As of February 6, 2023, we believe that our existing cash of $964,000,
together with $5.7 million remaining balance under our $14.0 million revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank
(“SVB Credit Facility”), and $4.0 million available under the Subordinated LOC, along with the forecasted gross margin will
be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital resources to fund planned operations for the next twelve (12) months. See “Future
Liquidity Needs” below

Future
Liquidity Needs
We
have evaluated our expected cash requirements over the next twelve (12) months, which include, but are not limited to, investments
in additional sales and marketing and research and development, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements. As of
February 6, 2023, we believe that our existing cash of $964,000, cash from our future operations, and additional funding of up to
$5.7 million remaining balance under our SVB Credit Facility, combined with funds available to us under our Subordinated LOC of up to $4.0 million,
along with the forecasted gross margin will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital resources to fund planned operations for
at least the next twelve (12) months. As of February 6, 2023, $5.7 million remained available under our ATM offering that may be
utilized if necessary subject to the volume of trading and price of our stock and market conditions. In addition, to support our
operations and anticipated growth, we intend to continue our efforts to secure additional capital from a variety of current and new
sources including, but not limited to, sales of our equity securities. We also continue to execute our cost reduction, sourcing,
pricing recovery initiatives in efforts to increase our gross margins and improve cash flow from operations.
Although
management believes that our existing cash and the additional funding sources currently available to us under the lines of credit are
sufficient to fund planned operations for the next twelve (12) months, this is dependent our ability to successfully maintain and draw
on our credit facilities. Our ability to draw funds from the SVB Credit Facility are subject to certain restrictions and covenants. If
we are unable to meet the conditions provided in the loan documents, the funds will not be available to us. In addition, should there
be any delays in the receipts of key component parts, due in part to supply change disruptions, our ability to fulfil the backlog of
sales orders will be negatively impacted resulting in lower availability of cash resources from operations. In that event, we may be
required to raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities. If such funds are not available when required, management
will be required to curtail investments in additional sales and marketing and product development, which may have a material adverse
effect on future cash flows and results of operations. In addition, any, unforeseen factors in the general economy beyond management’s
control could potentially have negative impact on the planned gross margin improvement plan.
In
the event we are required to obtain additional funds, there is no guarantee that additional funds will be available on a timely basis
or on acceptable terms. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders
may experience additional dilution and such financing may involve restrictive covenants.
Critical
Accounting Policies
The
unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date
of the unaudited financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Information with respect to our critical accounting policies which we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported
results and require subjective or complex judgments by management is contained in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 filed with
the SEC on September 28, 2022.

under this item.

ITEM
4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
as of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Act of 1934. Our disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be included in our SEC reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, relating to the Company, including our consolidated
subsidiaries, and was made known to them by others within those entities, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared.
Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of December 31, 2022.
The
management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s principal executive officer
and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control
systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Additionally, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As
described in the Company’s 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting and based on such assessment, management concluded that as of June 30, 2022, our internal control
over financial reporting was not effective due to material weakness related to ineffective oversight of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting and lack of sufficient review and approval of the underlying data used in the calculation of warranty
reserve. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we have implemented additional control procedures to strengthen the oversight
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting through review and sign off by the senior management of all significant
assumptions and estimates being used and the underlying data used in producing financial schedules/estimates and financial reporting.
We have also added a second level of review and approval for all manual journal entries for significant estimates and assumptions made
by management. Based on the foregoing, we believe we have remediated the material weaknesses. We plan to continue to assess our internal
controls and control procedures and intend to take further action as necessary or appropriate to address any other matters we identify
or are brought to our attention.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Except
as discussed above, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended
December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.

II - OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM
1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However,
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may
harm our business. To the best knowledge of management, there are no material legal proceedings pending against the Company.
ITEM
1A - RISK FACTORS
An
