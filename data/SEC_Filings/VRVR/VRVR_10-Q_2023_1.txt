Note
1.
Basis of Presentation
While
the information presented in the accompanying December 31, 2022 financial statements is unaudited, it includes all adjustments which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). In
the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations and financial position
have been included and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
in financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the Company’s September 30, 2022 audited financial statements (and notes thereto). Operating results for the
three months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the year ending September
30, 2023.
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements herein contain the operations of Virtual Interactive Technologies
Corp. (OTCPINK: VRVR), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Advanced Interactive Gaming Inc. (“AIG Inc.”) and Advanced Interactive
Gaming Ltd. (“AIG Ltd”) (collectively, the “Company” or “VIT”). All significant intercompany amounts
have been eliminated.

Business
Nature
of Operations
The
Company is a next generation game and metaverse developer that creates immersion experiences by harnessing the latest technologies, including
Blockchain and digital assets. The Company’s newly launched brand, Extrosive, is building a metaverse that replaces traditional
boring financial experiences with a new paradigm, “global Prosperity space” (gPs). This new asset class dynamically augments
global and local realities and builds communities of aligned financial values, virtuous economies, and a trusted network. The result
would be a metaverse game for the glamourous world of Wall Street, High-Speed trading involving community building, quantified self,
and NFTs – a pure adrenal rush! In addition, the Company continues to build on its successful catalog that includes Carmageddon
Max Damage, Carmageddon Crashers, Interplanetary: Enhanced Edition, Catch & Release, and Worbitol. The Company also entered into
a joint development partnership with Duane Lee “Dog” Chapman, of the “Dog The Bounty Hunter” fame, to develop
and promote multiple games across several platforms. For more information, please visit www.vrvrcorp.com.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain
reported amounts and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimated.
Cash
Equivalents
The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
Company had
no
cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 or September 30, 2022.
7
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company accounts for fair value measurements in accordance with accounting standard ASC 820-10-50, “ Fair Value Measurements.”
ASC 820 defines fair value and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances
disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follows:
-
Level
1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
-
Level
2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
-
Level
3 inputs to valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair measurement.
The
Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, royalties receivable, notes receivable and related accrued interest receivable,
accounts payable and accrued expenses, and notes payable and related accrued interest payable. The carrying value of these financial
instruments approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments.
Net
Income (Loss) Per Share
In
accordance with ASC 260
“Earnings per Share,”
the basic net income (loss) per share (“EPS”) is
computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net loss
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted on an
“if-converted” basis (for convertible preferred stock). During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company
had
270,612
and
595,612
shares, respectively, of Series B Convertible Preferred stock issued and outstanding that are convertible into shares of common
stock on a one-for-one basis. These potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the EPS computation due to their anti-dilutive effect resulting
from the Company’s net losses during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Foreign
Currency
The
Company’s functional currency is the US dollar. With the exception of stockholders’ equity (deficit), all transactions that
are originally denominated in foreign currency are translated to US dollars by our international customers, on a monthly basis, when
recognized by them and prior to paying royalties to the Company. All royalty revenues that are received and recognized by the Company
are recorded in US dollars.
Foreign
currency translation gains/losses are recorded in other accumulated comprehensive income (“AOCI”) based on exchange rates
prevalent on reporting dates for balance sheet items, and at weighted average exchange rates during the reporting period for the statement
of operations. Foreign currency transaction gains/losses are recorded as other income (expense) in the period of settlement. No AOCI
items were present during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as all financial statement items were denominated in the
US dollar. Losses from foreign currency transactions during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled $ 30
and $ 379 , respectively.
8
Concentration
of Credit Risk
Some
of our US dollar balances are held in a Bermuda bank that is not insured. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, uninsured deposits
in the Bermuda bank totaled $ 250
and $ 20,495 , respectively. Our management believes that the financial institution is financially sound,
and the risk of loss is low. The Company is in the process of migrating all of its banking to the institutions in the United States,
which are insured by the FDIC up to $ 250,000 .
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company follows the guidance contained in ASC 606,
“Revenue Recognition .” The core principle of ASC 606 is that an
entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods of services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 outlines the following five-step revenue
recognition model (along with other guidance impacted by this standard): (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the
performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations;
(5) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
Revenue
- Royalties
The
Company enters into agreements with third-party developers that require us to make payments for game development and production services.
In exchange for our payments, we receive the exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the finished game titles as well as, in
some cases, the underlying intellectual property rights. The Company has several contracts with video game developers that entitle us
to royalty streams as a percentage of revenues generated by the game sales, which vary from contract to contract. As of December 31,
2022, the Company has four royalty contracts with three developers that are generating royalty revenue.
Once
a game has been developed and has met the terms of the underlying royalty agreement, the game is released for commercial sales. Per each
contract, the Company will receive reports on a regular basis from the game developers’ sales platforms that identify the amount
of game sales, from which consideration expected to be collected from the commercial customers is computed based on the applicable royalty
percentages. Royalty revenue is based on a percentage of net receipts as defined in each customer agreement and is recognized in accordance
with the sale-based royalty provisions of ASC 606, which requires revenue recognition after the subsequent sales occur. The Company’s
performance obligation under each royalty contract as an investor in the game is complete once funds are advanced to the gaming developer.
Subsequent consideration is then received by the Company from the developers in the amount of the Company’s percentage fee of royalty
income (net receipts) received by the customer. Net receipts include all gross revenues received by the customer as a result of sales
of the games or related exploitation less certain taxes, refunds, manufacturing costs, freight, and other items specified in the underlying
contract.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized revenue from royalties of $ 42,224
and $ 30,392 , respectively.
Royalties
Receivable
The
Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible royalties. The Company’s estimate is based
on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of royalties receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company’s
estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change and that losses ultimately incurred could differ materially from the amounts
estimated in determining the allowance. The Company had royalties receivable of $ 104,509
and $ 83,644
at December 31, 2022 and September
30, 2022, respectively, and has determined that no allowance is necessary.
Going
Concern
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplates the Company’s
continuation as a going concern. The Company has not established profitable operations and has incurred significant losses since its
inception. The Company’s plan is to grow significantly over the next few years through strategic game development partnerships,
through internal game development and through the acquisition of independent game development companies globally.
9
The
Company has taken much of the cash flow from its first royalty agreement and has invested in royalty agreements for the development of
several other video games. By continuing to reinvest these royalties into agreements to develop new games, along with actively managing
corporate overhead, management’s plan is to substantially increase its video game royalty portfolio and cash flow over the next
several years. The Company intends to continue to grow its game portfolio over the next several years, focusing on console games, virtual
reality games and mobile games.
There
are no assurances that the Company will be able to either (1) achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations; or (2) obtain additional financing through either private placement, public offerings and/or debt financing necessary to
support its working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from operations and any private placements, public offerings
and/or debt financing are insufficient, the Company will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional
financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate working capital is not available
to the Company, it may be required to curtail or cease its operations.
Due
to uncertainties related to these matters, there exists a substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of
asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a
going concern.
New
Accounting Pronouncements
The
Company has evaluated all recently issued or enacted accounting pronouncements, and has determined that all such pronouncements either
do not apply or their impact is insignificant to the financial statements.

the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Revenue
increased from $30,392 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to $42,224 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Revenue
was derived from royalty interests in five games, Carmageddon Max Damage, Carmageddon Crashers, Catch & Release, Interplanetary:
Enhanced Edition and Worbital.
Operating
expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $765,003 and $197,809, respectively. This increase was primarily due
to professional fees incurred through issuances of stock and warrants that were associated with three vendor contracts.
Other
income (expense) for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was ($142,625) and ($118,635), respectively. This increase in
expense was mainly due to non-cash transactions associated with the amortization of debt discount in the current period of $112,857
versus $96,063 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2021. The Company incurred interest expense associated with additional
debt brought on in the second quarter of 2021. Interest expense recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $16,145
and $7,495, respectively. Interest expense recorded for related parties for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was
$13,971 and $15,152, respectively.

For
the three months ended December 31, 2022 we recorded a net loss of $865,404. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded
a net loss of $286,052. The increase in loss of $579,352 was mainly associated with additional general and administrative expenses identified
above, and debt discount amortization and interest expense associated with our related party and convertible notes payable.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
As
of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8,860. As of September 30, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $36,378.
Working capital was 620,278 as of December 31, 2022 compared to $809,447 at September 30, 2022. The decrease in working capital of $189,169
was primarily the result of vendor contracts associated with stock and warrants issued for services. The respective expense was recorded
as a prepaid asset and amortized over the life of the contract.
Cash
Flows from Operating Activities:
Net
cash used in operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $27,518 and $83,295, respectively. The change
over the two periods presented was $55,777.
