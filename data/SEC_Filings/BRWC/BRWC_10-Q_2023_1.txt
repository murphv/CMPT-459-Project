(CURRENCY
EXPRESSED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS (“US$”), EXCEPT FOR NUMBER OF SHARES)
1.
ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND
Birdie
Win Corporation, a Nevada corporation, (“the Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 16,
2021.
Birdie
Win Corporation is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We provide financial literacy seminar services to Malaysian individuals and
families. Our mission is to improve the financial well-being of our clients.
The
Company’s executive office is located at D109, Level 1, Block D, Kelana Square, Jalan SS 7/26, 47301 Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia.
2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of presentation
The
unaudited condensed financial statements for Birdie Win Corporation for the period ended January 31, 2023 are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) for interim financial statement,
instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulations S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022. In management’s
opinion, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation to make our financial
statements not misleading have been included. The results of operations for the periods ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 presented are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. The Company has adopted July 31 as its fiscal year end.
Going
Concern
For
the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $ 2,223
and as at January 31, 2023, the Company has accumulated
deficit of $ 28,144 . These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s profit generating operations in the future and/or obtaining the
necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. These
financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company expects to finance its
operations primarily through cash flow from revenue and continuing financial support from a shareholder. In the event that we require
additional funding to finance the growth of the Company’s current and expected future operations as well as to achieve our strategic
objectives, the shareholder has indicated the intent and ability to provide additional financing.
Use
of estimates
Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheets, and the reported
revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
F- 5
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.
Accounts
Receivable
Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. The Company
extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business and generally does not require collateral. The Company’s credit
terms are dependent upon the segment, and the customer. The Company assesses the probability of collection from each customer at the
outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors, including the customer’s payment history and its current creditworthiness.
If in management’s judgment collection is not probable, the Company does not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed.
Management
performs ongoing credit evaluations, and the Company maintains an allowance for potential credit losses based upon its loss history and
its aging analysis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of credit losses in existing
accounts receivable. Management reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts each reporting period based on a detailed analysis of trade
receivables. In the analysis, management primarily considers the age of the customer’s receivable, and also considers the creditworthiness
of the customer, the economic conditions of the customer’s industry, general economic conditions and trends, and the business relationship
and history with its customers, among other factors. If any of these factors change, the Company may also change its original estimates,
which could impact the level of the Company’s future allowance for doubtful accounts. If judgments regarding the collectability
of receivables were incorrect, adjustments to the allowance may be required, which would reduce profitability.
Accounts
receivable are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for
doubtful accounts receivable is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off as identified.
Lease
The
Company adopted the ASU No. 2016-02, on April 16, 2021 (date of inception). The Company leases office space for fixed periods without
pre-emptive extension options. The Company recognizes lease payments for its short-term lease on a straight-line basis over the lease
term.
F- 6
Plant
and equipment
Plant
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation of plant, equipment and software are calculated
on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives or lease terms generally as follows:

Revenue
Recognition
Revenue
is generated through provision of Personal Financial Literacy Seminar (PFL Seminar) services to customer. Revenue is recognized when
a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company
expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing,
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the
consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services. The Company applies the following five-step
model in order to determine this amount:
(i)
identification of the promised goods and services in the contract;
(ii)
determination of whether the promised goods and services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context
of the contract;
(iii)
measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;
(iv)
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and
(v)
recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
The
Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Under Topic 606, the Company records revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. The Company
records revenue from the provision of services upon delivery of the finalized Personal Financial Report to the customer.
Earnings
Per Share
The
Company reports earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260 “Earnings Per Share”, which requires presentation of basic
and diluted earnings per share in conjunction with the disclosure of the methodology used in computing such earnings per share. Basic
earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities
or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted into common stock. Further, if the number of common shares outstanding
increases as a result of a stock dividend or stock split or decreases as a result of a reverse stock split, the computations of a basic
and diluted earnings per share shall be adjusted retroactively for all periods presented to reflect that change in capital structure.
The
Company’s basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income available to holders by the weighted average number of
the Company’s ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the amount of net income available to each ordinary
share outstanding during the period plus the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities
had been issued.
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC 740 “Income Taxes”. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company
records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not
that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is
recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.
New
U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Reform”), was signed into
law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Reform modified the U.S. Internal Revenue Code by, among other things, reducing the statutory
U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from
35 %
to
21 %
for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017; limiting and/or eliminating
many business deductions; migrating the U.S. to a territorial tax system with a one-time transaction tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation
of previously deferred foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries; subject to certain limitations, generally eliminating U.S. corporate
income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; and providing for new taxes on certain foreign earnings. Taxpayers may elect to pay
the one-time transition tax over eight years, or in a single lump-sum payment.
F- 7
Related
parties
Parties,
which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control
the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also
considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.
Fair
Value Measurement
Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement clarifies that the exchange
price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the market in
which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability, that is, the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability. It also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and that market participant
assumptions include assumptions about risk and effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset.
This
ASC establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level
1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
Level
2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
full term of the asset or liability; and
Level
3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported
by little or no market activity).
Recently
issued and adopted accounting pronouncements
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326). ASU 2016-13 requires entities
to use a forward-looking approach based on current expected credit losses (“CECL”) to estimate credit losses on certain types
of financial instruments, including trade receivables. This may result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. ASU 2016-13
is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2023, and early adoption is permitted.
The
Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Management has not identified any other new standards that it believes will have
a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.

United
States of America
The
Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from
35 %
to
21 % for our tax years beginning in 2018, which resulted in the re-measurement
of the federal portion of our deferred tax assets from the
35 %
to
21 %
tax rate. The Company is registered in the State of Nevada and
is subject to United States of America tax law. As of January 31, 2023, the operations in the United States of America incurred $ 28,144
of cumulative net operating losses (NOL’s) which can be carried forward to offset future taxable income. The NOL carryforwards
begin to expire in 2043, if unutilized. The Company has provided for a full valuation allowance of approximately $ 5,910
against the deferred
tax assets on the expected future tax benefits from the net operating loss carryforwards as the management believes it is more likely
than not that these assets will not be realized in the future.

SEGMENT REPORTING
ASC
280, “Segment Reporting” establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with
the Company’s internal organization structure as well as information about services categories, business segments and major customers
in financial statements. The Company has single reportable segment based on business unit, financial services business and two reportable
segments based on country, Malaysia and Hong Kong.
In
accordance with the “Segment Reporting” Topic of the ASC, the Company’s chief operating decision maker has been identified
as the Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing
performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements
to report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers,
and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation
under “Segment Reporting” due to their similar customer base and similarities in economic characteristics; nature of products
and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes.

GOING CONCERN
For
the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $ 2,223
and as at January 31, 2023, the Company has accumulated
deficit of $ 28,144 . These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s profit generating operations in the future and/or obtaining the
necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. These
financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company expects to finance its
operations primarily through cash flow from revenue and continuing financial support from a shareholder. In the event that we require
additional funding to finance the growth of the Company’s current and expected future operations as well as to achieve our strategic
objectives, the shareholder has indicated the intent and ability to provide additional financing.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In

of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued, the Company has evaluated all events or
transactions that occurred after January 31, 2023 up through the date the Company issued the financial statements. During the period,
the Company did not have any material recognizable subsequent events.

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326). ASU 2016-13 requires entities
to use a forward-looking approach based on current expected credit losses (“CECL”) to estimate credit losses on certain types
of financial instruments, including trade receivables. This may result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. ASU 2016-13
is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2023, and early adoption is permitted.
The
Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Management has not identified any other new standards that it believes will have
a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.

Item
3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
As
a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information
required by this Item.
Item
4 Controls and Procedures.
Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.
We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer,
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2023. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls
and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting, our chief executive
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. The matters involving internal controls and procedures
that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (i)
lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors
on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;
(ii) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (iii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting
and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. The aforementioned material
weaknesses were identified by our chief executive officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of January 31,
2023.
Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management’s review and approval
of all transactions. Our internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that:
1.
pertain to the maintenance
of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
2.
provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that
our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management; and
3.
provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing
of the operational effectiveness of these controls.
As
of January 31, 2023, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in 2013 and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments.
Based on such evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that, during the period covered by this Report, our internal control
over financial reporting were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the six months ended January 31, 2023, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
