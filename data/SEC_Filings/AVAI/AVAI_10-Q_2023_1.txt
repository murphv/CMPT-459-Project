Note 2 –
GOING CONCERN
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), which contemplate continuation
of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company had limited revenues and recurring losses as of December 31, 2022. The Company
has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period
of time. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management anticipates
that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends
to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management’s efforts,
there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue
as a going concern.
Note 3 –
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
Basis of presentation
The accompanying condensed financial statements have
been prepared by Trend Innovations Holding Inc. in accordance with GAAP without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which
include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as
of December 31, 2022 and for the related periods presented.
The results for the nine months ended December 31,
2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. These financial statements and related footnotes
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Application Development Costs
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 985, Software,
which requires that all costs relating to the purchase or internal development and production of software products to be sold, leased
or otherwise marketed, be expensed in the period incurred unless the requirements for technological feasibility have been established.
The Company capitalizes all eligible software costs incurred once technological feasibility is established. The Company amortizes these
costs using the straight-line method over a period of three years, which is the remaining estimated economic life of the costs. At the
end of each reporting period, the Company writes down any excess of the unamortized balance over the net realizable value.
D epreciation, Amortization, and Capitalization
The Company records depreciation and amortization
when appropriate using straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets. We estimate that the useful life of equipment
is 5 years and website development is 1 year. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions,
major renewals and replacements that increase the property's useful life are capitalized. Property sold or retired, together with the
related accumulated depreciation is removed from the appropriate accounts and the resultant gain or loss is included in net income.

The Company had $ 18,812
of cash as of December 31, 2022.
P repaid Expenses
Prepaid expenses are amounts paid to secure the use
of assets or the receipt of services at a future date or continuously over one or more future periods. When the prepaid expenses are eventually
consumed, they are charged to expense. Prepaid Expenses are recorded at fair market value.
The Company had $ 1,505
in prepaid expenses as of December
31, 2022 (March 31, 2022 – $ 126,162 ). Prepaid expenses consist of prepaid services.

Lease
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease
at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and
operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities,
and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying
asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease
ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most
of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, The Company generally use the incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of
interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also
includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the lease term.
Website Development Costs
The Company amortizes these costs using the straight-line
method over a period of one years, which is the remaining estimated economic life of the costs. At the end of each reporting period, the
Company writes down any excess of the unamortized balance over the net realizable value.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company considers the U.S. dollar to be its functional
currency as it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates. All assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date.
All exchange gains and losses are included in operations.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, foreign
currency transaction gain was $(2,965).
Income Taxes
Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability
method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation
allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
Revenue Recognition
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 606. ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, establishes principles for reporting information about the nature,
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts to provide goods or services to customers.
The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance
obligations are satisfied.
The Company has assessed the impact of the guidance
by performing the following five steps analysis:
Step 1: Identify the contract
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations
Step 3: Determine the transaction price
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price
Step 5: Recognize revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue.
Revenue from supplies of consulting services is recognized
when title and risk of loss are transferred and there are no continuing obligations to the customer. Title and the risks and rewards of
ownership transfer to and accepted by the customer when the services are collected by the customer at the Company’s office. Revenue
is recorded net of sales discounts, returns, allowances, and other adjustments that are based upon management’s best estimates and
historical experience and are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded. Based on limited operating history,
management estimates that there was no sales return for the period reported.
The Company derives its revenue from direct sales
to individuals and business companies. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue when services are sold and accepted by the customers
and there are no continuing obligations to the customer.

Basic Income (Loss) Per Share
The Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance
with FASB ASC 260 “Earnings per Share”. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect
to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if
their effect is anti-dilutive. For the period from November 6, 2017 (inception) through December 31, 2022, there were no potentially dilutive
debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income is defined as all changes in
stockholders’ equity (deficit), exclusive of transactions with owners, such as capital investments. Comprehensive income includes
net income or loss, changes in certain assets and liabilities that are reported directly in equity such as translation adjustments on
investments in foreign subsidiaries and unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities. For the nine months period ended December
31, 2022, our net income (loss) was ($ 223,995 ) and comprehensive loss was ($ 226,960 ).
COVID-19 Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties
Our company may be subject to the risks arising from
COVID-19's impacts on the IT industry. Our management believes that these impacts, which include but are not limited to the following,
may have a negative effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows: (i) prohibitions or limitations on in-person
activities associated with meetings; (ii) lack of consumer desire for incurring additional expenses during these times; and (iii) deteriorating
economic conditions, such as increased unemployment rates. In addition, we have considered the impacts and uncertainties of COVID-19 in
our use of estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These estimates include, but are not limited to, likelihood
of achieving performance conditions under performance-based equity awards, net realizable value of inventory, and the fair value of reporting
units and goodwill for impairment.
In Spring of 2020, a lot of governments around the
world issued lockdown orders prohibiting their respective citizens from working in the offices and arranging face-to-face meetings. There
also were instances of reducing number of hours available to each employee. These actions were taken in response to the economic impact
of COVID-19 on business areas resulted in a reduction of productivity for the year 2020. Due to the online nature of the company’s
operations, our regular course of business did not incur significant changes. However, the company’s clients and third parties had
to adjust their operations which resulted in a decreased number of agreements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We have reviewed all the recently issued, but not
yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company.

There is no assurance that
our company will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued working capital requirements.
There is substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon
public
offering
and achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant
dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will
increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.
Due to the uncertainty of
our ability to meet our current operating and capital expenses, in their report on our audited consolidated financial statements, our
independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our
assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
The Company does not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
There is no historical financial
information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in a start-up stage of operations and have generated
limited revenues since inception. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to
risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to
price and cost increases in services and products.

Our management is responsible for establishing and

and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
