RBC Bearings Incorporated
Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial
Statements
(dollars in thousands, except per share data)
1. Basis of Presentation
The interim consolidated financial statements included herein have
been prepared by RBC Bearings Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company”), without
audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The interim financial statements
included with this report have been prepared on a consistent basis with the Company’s audited financial statements and notes thereto
included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2022 (our “Annual Report”).
We condensed or omitted certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in our annual audited financial statements, which
we prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). As used in this report, the terms “we,”
“us,” “our,” “RBC” and the “Company” mean RBC Bearings Incorporated and its subsidiaries,
unless the context indicates another meaning.
These statements reflect all adjustments, accruals, and estimates,
consisting only of items of a normal recurring nature, that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of
the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented. These financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report.
The results of operations
for the three- and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the entire fiscal
year ending April 1, 2023. The three- and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 each included 13 weeks and 39
weeks, respectively. The amounts shown are in thousands, unless otherwise indicated.
2. Significant Accounting Policies
The Company’s significant accounting policies are
detailed in “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of our Annual Report.
Significant changes to our
accounting policies as a result of adopting new accounting standards are discussed below.
Recent Accounting Standards Adopted
In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting
Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04,
Reference Rate Reform
(Topic 848) -
Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate
Reform on Financial Reporting . The objective of the standard is to address operational challenges likely to arise in accounting for
contract modifications and hedge accounting due to reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU provide optional expedients and exceptions
for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to
be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The standard update is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December
31, 2022. This guidance is available immediately and may be implemented in any period prior to the guidance expiration on December 31,
2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848):
Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 ,
which deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company adopted this ASU during the third
quarter of our fiscal year and elected to apply the practical expedient which allows us to account for the modification of the New Credit
Agreement discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements as if the modification was not substantial. The impact of the adoption of this
standard update did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Standards Yet to Be Adopted
In November 2021, the FASB
issued ASU 2021-10,
Government Assistance
(Topic 832). ASU 2021-10 is intended to increase transparency of government assistance
by requiring entities to disclose the types of government assistance, the entity’s accounting for government assistance, and the effect
of the government assistance on an entity’s financial statements. This new guidance is effective for all entities for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance.
Other new pronouncements issued
but not effective until after April 1, 2023 are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations
or liquidity.

Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining performance
obligations represent the transaction price of orders meeting the definition of a contract for which work has not been performed or
has been partially performed and excludes unexercised contract options. The duration of the majority of our contracts, as defined by
ASC Topic 606, is less than one year. The Company has elected to apply the practical expedient, which allows the Company to exclude
remaining performance obligations with an original expected duration of one year or less. The aggregate amount of the transaction
price allocated to remaining performance obligations for such contracts with a duration of more than one year was approximately
$ 342,081
at December 31, 2022.
The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately 62% and 86% of the remaining performance
obligations over the next 12 and 24 months, respectively, with the remainder recognized thereafter.

Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition,
invoicing and cash collections affect accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets) and customer advances and deposits (contract
liabilities) on the consolidated balance sheets. These assets and liabilities are reported on the consolidated balance sheets on an individual
contract basis at the end of each reporting period.
Contract Assets (Unbilled
Receivables)
- Pursuant to the over-time revenue recognition model, revenue may be recognized prior to the customer being invoiced.
An unbilled receivable is recorded to reflect revenue that is recognized when (1) the cost-to-cost method is applied and (2) such revenue
exceeds the amount invoiced to the customer.
As of December 31, 2022 and
April 2, 2022, current contract assets were $ 5,011
and $ 3,882 , respectively, and included within prepaid expenses and other current assets
on the consolidated balance sheets. The increase in contract assets was primarily due to the recognition of revenue related to the satisfaction
or partial satisfaction of performance obligations prior to billing, partially offset by amounts billed to customers during the period.
As of December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, the Company did not have any contract assets classified as noncurrent on the consolidated balance
sheets.
Contract Liabilities (Deferred
Revenue)
- The Company may receive a customer advance or deposit, or have an unconditional right to receive a customer advance, prior
to revenue being recognized. Since the performance obligations related to such advances may not have been satisfied, a contract liability
is established. Advance payments are not considered a significant financing component as the timing of the transfer of the related goods
or services is at the discretion of the customer.
As of December 31, 2022 and
April 2, 2022, current contract liabilities were $ 17,474
and $ 19,556 , respectively, and included within accrued expenses and other current
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in current contract liabilities was primarily due to revenue recognized on
customer contracts, partially offset by advance payments received and the reclassification of a portion of advance payments received from
the noncurrent portion of contract liabilities. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized revenues
of $ 2,589
and $ 10,063 , respectively, that were included in the contract liability balance as of April 2, 2022. For the three and nine
months ended January 1, 2022, the Company recognized revenues of $ 3,783
and $ 10,562 , respectively, that were included in the contract
liability balance at April 3, 2021.
As of December 31, 2022 and
April 2, 2022, noncurrent contract liabilities were $ 17,819
and $ 10,401 , respectively, and included within other noncurrent liabilities
on the consolidated balance sheets. The increase in noncurrent contract liabilities was primarily due to advance payments received, partially
offset by the reclassification of a portion of advance payments received to the current portion of contract liabilities.
Variable Consideration
The amount of consideration
to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for goods and services is not generally subject to significant variations.
However, the Company does offer certain customers rebates, prompt payment discounts, end-user discounts, the right to return eligible
products, and/or other forms of variable consideration. The Company estimates this variable consideration using the expected value amount,
which is based on historical experience. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable
that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration
is resolved. The Company adjusts the estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive
changes or when the consideration becomes fixed. Accrued customer rebates were $ 38,284
and $ 35,234
at December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022,
respectively, and are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

5. Net Income/(Loss) Per Share Attributable
to Common Stockholders
Basic net income/(loss) per
share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted net income/(loss)
per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders by the sum
of the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents then outstanding using the treasury stock method.
Common share equivalents consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and the conversion of the
outstanding
5.00 % Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“MCPS”) to common shares.
We exclude outstanding stock
options, stock awards and the MCPS from the calculations if the effect would be anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of the MCPS is calculated
using the if-converted method. The if-converted method assumes that these securities were converted to shares of common stock at the later
of the September 24, 2021 issuance date or the beginning of the reporting period to the extent that the effect is dilutive. If the effect
is anti-dilutive, we calculate net income/(loss) per share attributable to common stockholders by adjusting net income/(loss) in the numerator
for the effect of the cumulative MCPS dividends for the respective period.
For the three- and nine-month
periods ended December 31, 2022, the effect of assuming the conversion of the
4,600,000
shares of MCPS into shares of common stock was
anti-dilutive, and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders. Accordingly,
net income/(loss) was reduced by cumulative MCPS dividends, as presented in our consolidated statement of operations, for purposes of
calculating net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders.
For the three months ended
December 31, 2022,
91,816
employee stock options and
1,085
restricted shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per
share attributable to common stockholders. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022,
111,446
employee stock options and
1,085
restricted
shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders. The inclusion of these employee
stock options and restricted shares would have been anti-dilutive.
For the three months ended
January 1, 2022, all employee stock options and restricted shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share attributable
to common stockholders as the Company generated a loss for the period. For the nine months ended January 1, 2022,
164,265
employee stock
options and 200 restricted shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders.
The inclusion of these employee stock options and restricted shares would have been anti-dilutive.

6. Fair Value
Fair value is defined as the
price that would be expected to be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date (exit price). The FASB provides accounting rules that classify the inputs used to measure fair value
into the following hierarchy:
Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for similar assets or liabilities, or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that
are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset
or liability.
Financial assets and liabilities
are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
As a result of the occurrence
of triggering events such as purchase accounting for acquisitions, the Company measures certain assets and liabilities based on Level
3 inputs.
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The Company’s financial
instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, short-term borrowings, long-term
debt, and a derivative in the form of an interest rate swap. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term borrowings are a reasonable estimate of their fair value.
Long-term assets held on our balance sheets related to benefit plan obligations are measured at fair value. The fair value of the Company’s
long-term fixed-rate debt, based on quoted market prices, was $ 436,175
and $ 463,750
at December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, respectively.
The carrying value of this debt was $ 493,040
at December 31, 2022 and $ 492,396
at April 2, 2022. The fair value of long-term fixed-rate
debt was measured using Level 1 inputs. Due to the nature of fair value calculations for variable-rate debt, the carrying value of the
Company’s long-term variable-rate debt is a reasonable estimate of its fair value. The fair value of the interest rate swap was $ 1,116
at December 31, 2022, measured using Level 2 inputs. This amount is included in other noncurrent liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive
income on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, and in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
The Company does not believe
it has significant concentrations of risk associated with the counterparties to its financial instruments.

10. Debt
Domestic Credit Facility
On November 1, 2021 RBC Bearings Incorporated, our top holding company,
and our Roller Bearing Company of America, Inc. subsidiary (“RBCA”) entered into a Credit Agreement (the “New Credit
Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”), as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent,
Swingline Lender and Letter of Credit Issuer and the other lenders party thereto, and terminated the Company’s prior credit agreement,
which was entered into with Wells Fargo in 2015. The New Credit Agreement provides the Company with (a) a $ 1,300,000
term loan facility
(the “Term Loan Facility”), which was used to fund a portion of the cash purchase price for the acquisition of our Dodge business
unit and to pay related fees and expenses, and (b) a $ 500,000
revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and
together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Facilities”). Debt issuance costs associated with the New Credit Agreement totaled
$ 14,947
and are being amortized over the life of the New Credit Agreement.
Prior to December 2022,
amounts outstanding under the Facilities generally bore interest at either, at the Company’s
option, (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (i) Wells Fargo’s prime lending rate, (ii) the federal funds effective
rate plus 0.50% and (iii) the one-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) rate plus 1.00% or (b) the LIBOR rate plus a specified margin,
depending on the type of borrowing being made. The applicable margin was based on the Company’s consolidated ratio of total net
debt to consolidated EBITDA from time to time. In December 2022 the New Credit Agreement was amended to replace LIBOR with the secured
overnight financing rate administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“SOFR”) so that borrowings under the Facilities
denominated in U.S. dollars bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Term SOFR (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) plus a credit
spread adjustment of 0.10% plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 2.00% depending on the Company’s consolidated ratio of total net
debt to consolidated EBITDA. The Facilities are subject to a SOFR floor of 0.00%. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s margin
was 0.50% for base rate loans and 1.50% for SOFR loans.
The Company’s commitment fee rate was
0.20 % and the letter of credit fee
rate was
1.50 %.
The Term Loan Facility will mature on
November 2, 2026
and amortizes
in quarterly installments with the balance payable on the maturity date. The Company can elect to prepay some or all of the outstanding
balance from time to time without penalty, which will offset future quarterly amortization installments. The required future principal
payments on the Term Loan Facility are $ 0
for the remainder of fiscal 2023, $ 0
for fiscal 2024, and $ 0
for fiscal 2025, due to prepayments
previously made, and approximately $ 27,500
for fiscal 2026, and $ 942,500
for fiscal 2027. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on
November 2, 2026, at which time all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility will be payable.
14
The New Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with various
covenants, including the following financial covenants: (a) a maximum total net leverage ratio of 5.50:1.00, which maximum ratio will
decrease during certain subsequent test periods as set forth in the New Credit Agreement (provided that, no more than once during the
term of the Facilities, such maximum ratio applicable at such time may be increased by the Company by 0.50:1.00 for a period of 12 months
after the consummation of a material acquisition), and (b) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.00:1.00.
As of December 31, 2022, the
Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.
The New Credit Agreement allows
the Company to, among other things, make distributions to stockholders, repurchase its stock, incur other debt or liens, or acquire or
dispose of assets provided that the Company complies with certain requirements and limitations of the New Credit Agreement.
The Company’s domestic
subsidiaries have guaranteed the Company’s obligations under the New Credit Agreement, and the Company’s obligations and the
domestic subsidiaries’ guaranty are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the domestic assets of the Company and its domestic
subsidiaries.
As of December 31, 2022, $ 970,000
was outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and approximately $ 3,675
of the Revolving Credit Facility was being utilized to provide letters
of credit to secure the Company’s obligations relating to certain insurance programs, and the Company had the ability to borrow
up to an additional $ 496,325
under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Senior Notes
On October 7, 2021, RBCA issued
$ 500,000
aggregate principal amount of
4.375 % Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Senior Notes”). The net proceeds from the issuance
of the Senior Notes were approximately $ 491,992
after deducting initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
On November 1, 2021, the Company used the proceeds to fund a portion of the cash purchase price for the acquisition of Dodge.
The Senior Notes were issued
pursuant to an indenture with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Indenture”). The Indenture contains
covenants limiting the ability of the Company to (i) incur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness, (ii) declare or pay dividends,
redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders, (iii) make investments, (iv) create liens or use assets as security in other
transactions, (v) merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of its assets, (vi) enter into transactions
with affiliates, and (vii) sell or transfer certain assets. These covenants contain various exceptions, limitations and qualifications.
At any time that the Senior Notes are rated investment grade, certain of these covenants will be suspended.
The Senior Notes are guaranteed
jointly and severally on a senior unsecured basis by RBC Bearings and certain of RBCA’s existing and future wholly owned domestic
subsidiaries that also guarantee the New Credit Agreement.
15
Interest on the Senior Notes
accrues at a rate of
4.375 % and is payable semi–annually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year.
The Senior Notes will mature
on October 15, 2029. The Company may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time on or after October 15, 2024 at the redemption
prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The Company may also
redeem up to 40% of the Senior Notes using the proceeds of certain equity offerings completed before October 15, 2024, at a redemption
price equal to 104.375% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
In addition, at any time prior to October 15, 2024, the Company may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of
the principal amount, plus a “make–whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date. If the Company sells certain of its assets or experiences specific kinds of changes in control, the Company must offer
to purchase the Senior Notes.
Foreign Borrowing Arrangements
One of our foreign subsidiaries, Schaublin SA (“Schaublin”), entered into two separate credit agreements
in 2019 with Credit Suisse (Switzerland) Ltd. (the “Foreign Credit Agreements”) to (i) finance the acquisition of our Swiss
Tool business unit, and (ii) provide future working capital. The Foreign Credit Agreements provided Schaublin with a CHF
15,000
(approximately
$ 15,383 ) term loan, which was extinguished in February 2022, and a CHF
15,000
(approximately $ 15,383 ) revolving credit facility, which
was terminated in October 2022. Schaublin now has a separate CHF
5,000
(approximately $ 5,407
USD) revolving credit facility (the “New
Foreign Revolver”) with Credit Suisse to provide future working capital, if necessary. As of December 31, 2022, $ 0
had been borrowed
from the New Foreign Revolver. Fees associated with the New Foreign Revolver are nominal if the facility is not utilized.

11. Income Taxes
The Company files income tax
returns in numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, with returns subject to examination for varying periods, but generally back to and
including the year ending March 30, 2019, although certain tax credits generated in earlier years are open under statute from March 29,
2008. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examination by the Internal Revenue Service for years ending before March 30,
2019.
The effective income tax rates for the three-month periods ended December
31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, were
24.4 % and
79.2 %, respectively. In addition to discrete items, the effective income tax rates for both
these periods were different from the U.S. statutory rates due to the foreign-derived intangible income provision and U.S. credit for
increasing research activities, which decreased the rate, and state income taxes, foreign income taxes, and nondeductible stock-based
compensation, which increased the rate. In the quarter ended, January 1, 2022, the Company’s tax rate was also increased by non-deductible
transaction costs incurred in the Dodge acquisition.
The effective income tax rate for the three-month period ended December
31, 2022 of
24.4 % included $ 253
of tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation, partially offset by $ 218
of other items. The
effective income tax rate without discrete items for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 would have been
24.5 %. The effective
income tax rate for the three-month period ended January 1, 2022 of
79.2 % included $ 473
of tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation,
partially offset by $ 146
of other items. The effective income tax rate without discrete items for the three-month period ended January
1, 2022 would have been
91.6 %. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that some of its unrecognized tax positions may be effectively
settled within the next 12 months due to the closing of audits and the statute of limitations expiring in various jurisdictions. The decrease
in the Company’s unrecognized tax positions, pertaining primarily to federal and state credits and state tax, is estimated to be
approximately $ 3,086 .
16
Income tax expense for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022
was $ 31,853
compared to $ 9,944
for the nine-month period ended January 1, 2022. Our effective income tax rate for the nine-month period
ended December 31, 2022 was
21.3 % compared to
30.0 % for the nine-month period ended January 1, 2022. In addition to discrete items, the
effective income tax rates for both these periods are different from the U.S. statutory rates due to the foreign-derived intangible income
provision and U.S. credit for increasing research activities, which decrease the rate, and state income taxes, foreign income taxes, and
nondeductible stock-based compensation, that increase the rate. In the quarter ended, January 1, 2022, the Company’s tax rate was
also increased by non-deductible transaction costs incurred in the Dodge acquisition.
The effective income tax
rate for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2022 of
21.3 % included $ 3,228
of tax benefits associated with stock-based
compensation partially offset by $ 30
of other items. The effective income tax rate without these benefits and other items for the
nine-month period ended December 31, 2022 would have been
23.5 %. The effective income tax rate for the nine-month period ended
January 1, 2022 of
30.0 % included $ 2,703
of tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation offset by the establishment of a
$ 1,853
valuation allowance for capital loss carryforwards we don’t expect to recognize and $ 86
of other items. The effective
income tax rate without these benefits, valuation allowance and other items for the nine-month period ended January 1, 2022 would
have been
32.3 %.

13. Dodge Acquisition
On November 1, 2021, the Company
completed the acquisition of Dodge for approximately $ 2,908,241 , net of cash acquired and subject to certain adjustments. The purchase
price was paid with (i) $ 1,285,761
of borrowing under the Term Loan Facility, net of issuance costs, (ii) $ 1,050,811
of net proceeds from
common stock and MCPS offerings, (iii) $ 494,200
of net proceeds from the Senior Notes offering, and (iv) approximately $ 77,469
of cash
on hand. Since the close of the transaction, purchase price adjustments totaling $ 28,710
have been recorded.
In the acquisition, the Company
purchased
100 % of the capital stock of certain entities, including Dodge Mechanical Power Transmission Company Inc. (now known as Dodge
Industrial, Inc.), and certain other assets relating to ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd.’s mechanical power transmission business.
With offices in Greenville,
South Carolina, Dodge is a leading manufacturer of mounted bearings, gearings and mechanical products with market-leading brand recognition.
Dodge manufactures a complete line of mounted bearings, enclosed gearing and power transmission components across a diverse set of industrial
end markets. Dodge primarily operates across the construction and mining aftermarket, and the food & beverage, warehousing and general
machinery verticals, with sales predominately in the Americas.
Acquisition costs incurred
for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2022 totaled $ 22,598
and were recorded as period expenses and included within other, net within the
consolidated statements of operations. Remaining acquisition-related costs incurred for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022
were immaterial. This acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction. The purchase price allocation was completed during the
third quarter of fiscal 2023. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded based on their fair values at the date of acquisition
as follows:

The goodwill associated with
this acquisition is the result of expected synergies from combining the operations of the acquired business with the Company’s operations,
and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. $ 44,941
of the acquired goodwill is
deductible for tax purposes.
The fair value of the identifiable
intangible assets of $ 1,385,082 , consisting primarily of customer relationships and trade names, was determined using the income approach.
Specifically, a multi-period, excess earnings method was utilized for the customer relationships and the relief-from-royalty method was
utilized for the trade name. The fair value of the customer relationships, $ 1,185,000 , is being amortized based on the economic pattern
of benefit over a period of
24
years; the fair value of the trade names, $ 200,000 , is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a
26 -year term. These amortization periods represent the estimated useful lives of the assets.
18
The results of operations for Dodge have been included in the Company’s
financial statements for the period subsequent to the completion of the acquisition on November 1, 2021. Dodge contributed $ 174,765
of
revenue and $ 37,532
of operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Dodge contributed $ 544,505
of revenue and $ 106,178
of operating income for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. Dodge contributed $ 109,976
of revenue and $ 5,348
of operating income
for both the three and nine months ended January 1, 2022.
The following table reflects the unaudited pro forma operating results
of the Company for the three- and nine-month fiscal periods ended January 1, 2022, which gives effect to the acquisition of Dodge as if
it had been acquired on March 29, 2020. The pro forma results are based on assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under
the circumstances. The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred had the acquisition
been effective March 29, 2020, nor are they intended to be indicative of results that may occur in the future. The underlying pro forma
information includes the historical financial results of the Company and the acquired business adjusted for certain items such as amortization
of acquired intangible assets and acquisition costs incurred. The pro forma information does not include the effects of any synergies,
cost reduction initiatives or anticipated integration costs related to the acquisitions.

Upon closing, the Company entered into a transition services agreement (the “Dodge
TSA”) with ABB, pursuant to which ABB agreed to support the information technology, human resources and benefits, finance, tax and
treasury functions of the Dodge business for six to 12 months. Substantially all services under the Dodge TSA terminated on November 1,
2022. Costs associated with the Dodge TSA were $ 1,241
and $ 8,945
for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively,
and are included in other, net on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Since the purchase of the Dodge business on
November 1, 2021, costs associated with the Dodge TSA were $ 16,948
through December 31, 2022.
14. Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business
operations, including market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates. Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the
consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Changes in the fair values of derivatives
are recorded each period in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is effective as part
of a hedged transaction. Gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are subsequently
included in earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged item. The Company does not use derivative instruments
for speculative purposes.
On October 28, 2022, the Company entered into a three-year USD-denominated
interest rate swap (the “Swap”) with a third-party financial counterparty under the New Credit Agreement (see Note 10). The
Swap was executed to protect the Company from interest rate volatility on our variable-rate Term Loan Facility. The Swap has an effective
date of December 30, 2022 and is comprised of a $ 600,000
notional with a maturity of
three years . RBC will receive a variable rate based
on one-month Term SOFR and will pay a fixed rate of
4.455 %. The notional on the Swap will amortize as follows:
Year 1: $ 600,000
Year 2: $ 400,000
Year 3: $ 100,000
The Swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge of the variability
of the first unhedged interest payments (the hedged transactions) paid over the hedging relationship’s specified time period of
three years
attributable to the borrowing’s contractually specified interest index on the hedged principal of its general borrowing
program or replacement or refinancing thereof. The fair value of the Swap has been disclosed in Note 6. The accumulated other comprehensive
income derivative component balance was a $ 1,116
loss at December 31, 2022. The gain/loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
income into earnings will be recorded as interest income/expense on the Swap and will be included in the operating section of the Company’s
consolidated statements of cash flows.

impact on our results of operations; (r) we are subject to changes in legislative, regulatory and legal developments involving income
and other taxes; (s) we may be required to make significant future contributions to our pension plan; (t) we may incur material losses
for product liability and recall-related claims; (u) environmental and health and safety laws and regulations impose substantial costs
and limitations on our operations, and environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect; (v) our intellectual property and proprietary
information are valuable, and any inability to protect them could adversely affect our business and results of operations; in addition,
we may be subject to infringement claims by third parties; (w) cancellation of orders in our backlog could negatively impact our revenues,
cash flows and profitability; (x) if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report
our financial results or prevent fraud; (y) litigation could adversely affect our financial condition; (z) changes in accounting standards
or changes in the interpretations of existing standards could affect our financial results; (aa) risks associated with utilizing information
technology systems could adversely affect our operations; (bb) our quarterly performance can be affected by the timing of government product
inspections and approvals; (cc) we may not be able to efficiently integrate Dodge into our operations; (dd) we may fail to realize some
or all of the anticipated benefits of the Dodge acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected; (ee) we incurred
substantial debt in order to complete the Dodge acquisition, which could constrain our business and exposes us to the risk of defaults
under our debt instruments; and (ff) increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing the Term Loan Facility and could
reduce our profitability. Additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in our periodic filings
with the SEC, including, without limitation, the risks identified under the heading “Risk Factors” set forth in our Annual
Report. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures
or investments we may make. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update or alter any forward-looking statement. The following
section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, that

Overview
We are a well-known international
manufacturer and maker of highly engineered bearings and precision components. Our precision solutions are integral to the manufacture
and operation of most machines and mechanical systems, reduce wear to moving parts, facilitate proper power transmission, and reduce damage
and energy loss caused by friction. While we manufacture products in all major bearings categories, we focus primarily on the higher end
of the bearing and engineered component markets where we believe our value-added manufacturing and engineering capabilities enable us
to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and enhance profitability. We believe our expertise has enabled us to garner leading positions
in many of the product markets in which we primarily compete. With 56 facilities in 10 countries, of which 37 are manufacturing facilities,
we have been able to significantly broaden our end markets, products, customer base and geographic reach.
Previously we operated under
four reportable business segments – Plain Bearings, Roller Bearings, Ball Bearings, and Engineered Products – but the Dodge
acquisition has resulted
in a change in the internal organization of the Company and how our chief
operating decision maker makes operating decisions, assesses the performance of the business, and allocates resources so that
we
now operate under two reportable business segments – Aerospace/Defense and Industrial:
● Aerospace/Defense.
This segment represents
the end markets for the Company’s highly engineered bearings and precision components used in commercial aerospace, defense aerospace,
and marine and ground defense applications.
● Industrial.
This segment represents the end
markets for the Company’s highly engineered bearings, gearings and precision components used in various industrial applications
including: power transmission; construction, mining, energy and specialized equipment manufacturing; semiconductor production equipment
manufacturing; agricultural machinery, commercial truck and automotive manufacturing; and tool holding.
Financial
information for fiscal 2022 has been recast to conform to the new segment presentation.
The markets for our products
are cyclical, and we have endeavored to mitigate this cyclicality by entering into single and sole-source relationships and long-term
purchase agreements, through diversification across multiple market segments within the Aerospace/Defense and Industrial segments, by
increasing sales to the aftermarket, and by focusing on developing highly customized solutions.
Currently, our strategy is
built around maintaining our role as a leading manufacturer of highly engineered bearings and precision components through the following
efforts:
● Developing innovative solutions .
By leveraging our design and manufacturing expertise and
our extensive customer relationships, we continue to develop new products for markets in which there are substantial growth opportunities.
● Expanding customer base and penetrating end markets .
We continually seek opportunities to
access new customers, geographic locations and bearing platforms with existing products or profitable new product opportunities.
● Increasing aftermarket sales.
We believe that increasing our aftermarket sales of replacement parts will further
enhance the continuity and predictability of our revenues and enhance our profitability.
Such sales include sales to third party distributors and sales to OEMs for replacement products
and aftermarket services. The acquisition of Dodge has had a profound impact on our sales
volumes to distributors and other aftermarket customers. We expect to further increase the
percentage of our revenues derived from the replacement market by continuing to implement
several initiatives.
21
● Pursuing selective acquisitions.
The acquisition of businesses that complement or expand
our operations has been and continues to be an important element of our business strategy. We believe that there will continue to be consolidation
within the industry that may present us with acquisition opportunities.
Outlook
Our net sales for the three-month
period ended December 31, 2022 increased 31.7% compared to the same period last fiscal year, which included only two months of sales attributable
to the Dodge division. The increase in net sales was a result of a 41.6% increase in our Industrial segment and 13.2% increase in our
Aerospace/Defense segment. Excluding sales from Dodge, our Industrial segment increased 11.8% year over year. Our backlog, as of December
31, 2022, was $613.6 million compared to $603.1 million as of April 2, 2022.
We are continuing to see the recovery of the commercial aerospace business,
which increased by 24.2% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 versus the same period last fiscal year. We anticipate this
growth to continue throughout the rest of the fiscal year and beyond. Orders have continued to grow as evidenced by our backlog. Defense
sales, which represented approximately 31.7% of segment sales during the quarter, were down 4.8% year over year. This was in part due
to the timing of delivery on parts that require government approval prior to revenue being recognized.
The increase in our Industrial sales reflected a pattern of sustained growth
over the last fiscal year, with strong results in several areas. Our energy business during the quarter continued a pattern of growth
which is expected to continue into future periods.
The Company expects net sales
to be approximately $375.0 million to $385.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.
We experienced strong cash flow generation during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 as discussed
in the section “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. We expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter of the fiscal
year as customer demand continues to be significant. We believe that operating cash flows and available credit under the Revolving Credit
Facility will provide adequate resources to fund internal growth initiatives for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12
months. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $82.0 million, of which approximately $30.8 million was cash held
by our foreign operations.

Our net sales for the
three-month period ended December 31, 2022 increased 31.7% compared to the same period last fiscal year; on an organic basis (excluding Dodge sales for both periods), net
sales were up 12.7% year over year. Net sales in our Industrial segment increased 41.6% year over year; excluding Dodge, Industrial
segment sales increased 11.8% year over year. This reflected a pattern of sustained growth, with strong results in areas including
the energy and general industrial markets. Net sales in our Aerospace/Defense segment increased 13.2% year
over year, led by commercial OEM, which was up 22.8% compared to the same period in the prior year while sales to the defense sector
were down 4.8%. The increase in commercial aerospace reflected recovery in orders from large OEMs as build rates escalate and our
expansion in the aftermarket. Defense sales were negatively impacted by the timing of delivery on parts that require government
approval and/or completion of certain milestone achievements prior to revenue being recognized.

(see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below). Interest expense, net, was $20.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023
compared to $11.9 million for the same period last fiscal year. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company incurred approximately
$1.1 million in costs associated with the amortization of fees for a bridge financing commitment established in connection with the Dodge
acquisition during the third quarter of fiscal 2022, which was replaced with the Term Loan Facility, Revolving Credit Facility and Senior
Notes in the same quarter. The increase in interest expense from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 was primarily due to an additional month of
interest expense associated with the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility and the increase in LIBOR from fiscal 2022 to fiscal
2023.

Our effective income tax rate for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 was 24.4% compared to 79.2% for the three-month period
ended January 1, 2022. The effective income tax rate for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 of 24.4% included $0.3 million
of tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation offset by $0.2 million of other items. The effective income tax rate without
discrete items would have been 24.5%. The effective income tax rate for the three-month period ended January 1, 2022 of 79.2% included
$0.5 million of tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation offset by $0.1 million of other items. The effective income tax
rate without discrete items for the three-month period ended January 1, 2022 would have been 91.6%. The effective income tax rate differed
from the statutory rate primarily due to nondeductible stock-based compensation expense recognized in the period, and state and foreign
taxes that increased the rate while R&D credits and the foreign-derived intangible income provision decreased the rate. In the quarter
ended, January 1, 2022, the Company’s tax rate was also increased by non-deductible transaction costs incurred in the Dodge acquisition.

Segment Information
We previously reported our
financial results under four operating segments (Plain Bearings; Roller Bearings; Ball Bearings; and Engineered Products), but the Dodge
acquisition has resulted in a change in the internal organization of the Company and how our chief operating decision maker makes operating
decisions, assesses the performance of the business, and allocates resources. Accordingly, we now report our financial results under two
operating segments: Aerospace/Defense; and Industrial. Financial information for fiscal 2022 has been recast to conform to the new segment
presentation. We use segment net sales and gross margin as the primary measurements to assess the financial performance of each reportable
segment.

orders escalate in the OEM markets. Our defense markets, which represented approximately 31.7% of segment sales, decreased by approximately
4.8% during the period. These markets were impacted by the timing of deliveries to certain government customers that require sign-off
or achievement of certain milestones prior to shipment. Overall distribution and aftermarket sales, which represented 17.3% of segment
sales, increased 16.8% year over year.
Gross margin as a percentage

year due to the timing of shipments related to our marine business. During the year, we saw improvement in the sales and orders to our
commercial aerospace customers as build rates continued to grow. Our backlog and recent results reflect the early stages of this process

Net sales increased $72.3
million, or 41.6%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period last fiscal year. The increase was primarily
due to the inclusion of a full quarter of Dodge sales in fiscal 2023 and continued strong performance across the majority of our industrial
markets. Excluding Dodge sales from both periods, organic net sales increased 11.8% period over period. This increase was driven by performance
in energy and the general industrial markets. Sales to distribution and the aftermarket represented 67.7% of our
quarterly industrial sales. These distribution and aftermarket sales increased 54.7% compared to the same quarter in the prior year and
7.8% organically.
Gross margin for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 was 42.4% of net sales, compared to 32.2% in the comparable period in fiscal 2022. The improved gross margin
was due to price and volume increases and also the unfavorable impact of $7.0 million of inventory purchase accounting adjustments associated
with the Dodge acquisition during the third quarter of fiscal 2022.

Net sales increased $458.8

due to nine months of Dodge sales in fiscal 2023 compared to two months in fiscal 2022 and strong performance across our industrial markets.
Excluding Dodge sales, net sales increased $24.3 million, or 12.3%, period over period. Sales to distribution and the aftermarket increased
224.1% over last fiscal year, and 6.6% on an organic basis. The overall segment increase, excluding the addition of Dodge, was driven
by performance in semiconductor, energy, mining, and the general industrial markets.
Gross margin for the nine
months ended December 31, 2022 was 41.4% of net sales, compared to 34.8% in the same period in fiscal 2022. The increase in gross margin
is driven by price and volume increases and the fact that gross margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2022 included the unfavorable
impact of $7.0 million of inventory purchase accounting adjustments associated with the Dodge acquisition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
(dollars in millions in tables)
Our business is capital-intensive. Our capital requirements include manufacturing equipment
and materials. In addition, we have historically fueled our growth, in part, through acquisitions, including the Dodge acquisition completed
on November 1, 2021. We have historically met our working capital, capital expenditure and acquisition funding needs through our net cash
flows provided by operations, various debt arrangements and sales of equity to investors. We believe that operating cash flows and available
credit under the Revolving Credit Facility will provide adequate resources to fund internal growth initiatives for the foreseeable future.
For further discussion regarding the funding of the Dodge acquisition, refer to Part I, Item 1 – Note 13.
Our ability to meet future
working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected
by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, particularly interest rates, cyclical changes in our end markets and prices
for steel and our ability to pass through price increases on a timely basis, many of which are outside of our control. In addition, future
acquisitions could have a significant impact on our liquidity position and our need for additional funds.
From time to time, we evaluate our existing facilities and operations and their strategic
importance to us. If we determine that a given facility or operation does not have future strategic importance, we may sell, relocate,
consolidate or otherwise dispose of that facility or operations. Although we believe our operations would not be materially impaired by
such dispositions, relocations or consolidations, we could incur significant cash or non-cash charges in connection with them.
Liquidity
As of December 31, 2022, we
had cash and cash equivalents of $82.0 million, of which approximately $30.8 was cash held by our foreign operations. We expect that our
undistributed foreign earnings will be re-invested indefinitely for working capital, internal growth and acquisitions for and by our foreign
subsidiaries.
Domestic Credit Facility
On November 1, 2021 RBC Bearings Incorporated, our top holding company, and RBCA, our top operating subsidiary,
entered into the New Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Swingline Lender and Letter of Credit
Issuer and the other lenders party thereto, and terminated the Company’s prior credit agreement, which was entered into with Wells
Fargo in 2015. The New Credit Agreement provides the Company with (a) a $1,300.0 million term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”),
which was used to fund a portion of the cash purchase price for the acquisition of Dodge and to pay related fees and expenses, and (b)
a $500.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and together with the Term Loan Facility, the
“Facilities”). Debt issuance costs associated with the New Credit Agreement totaled $14.9 million and are being amortized
over the life of the New Credit Agreement.
29
Prior to December 2022, amounts outstanding
under the Facilities generally bore interest at either, at the Company’s option, (a) a base rate determined by reference to the
higher of (i) Wells Fargo’s prime lending rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (iii) the one-month London
interbank offered rate (LIBOR) rate plus 1.00% or (b) the LIBOR rate plus a specified margin, depending on the type of borrowing being
made. The applicable margin was based on the Company’s consolidated ratio of total net debt to consolidated EBITDA from time to
time. In December 2022 the New Credit Agreement was amended to replace LIBOR with the secured overnight financing rate administered by
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“SOFR”) so that borrowings under the Facilities denominated in U.S. dollars bear interest
at a rate per annum equal to Term SOFR (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% plus a margin
ranging from 0.75% to 2.00% depending on the Company’s consolidated ratio of total net debt to consolidated EBITDA. The Facilities
are subject to a SOFR floor of 0.00%. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s margin was 0.50% for base rate loans and 1.50% for
SOFR loans. The Company’s commitment fee rate was 0.20% and the letter of credit fee rate was 1.50%.
The Term Loan Facility will mature on November 2, 2026 and amortizes in quarterly installments
with the balance payable on the maturity date. The Company can elect to prepay some or all of the outstanding balance from time to time
without penalty, which will offset future quarterly amortization installments. The required future principal payments on the Term Loan
Facility are $0 for the remainder of fiscal 2023, $0 for fiscal 2024, and $0 for fiscal 2025, due to prepayments previously made, and
approximately $27.5 million for fiscal 2026, and $942.5 million for fiscal 2027. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on November
2, 2026, at which time all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility will be payable.
The New Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with various covenants, including
the following financial covenants: (a) a maximum total net leverage ratio of 5.50:1.00, which maximum ratio will decrease during certain
subsequent test periods as set forth in the New Credit Agreement (provided that, no more than once during the term of the Facilities,
such maximum ratio applicable at such time may be increased by the Company by 0.50:1.00 for a period of 12 months after the consummation
of a material acquisition), and (b) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.00:1.00. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance
with all debt covenants.
The New Credit Agreement allows
the Company to, among other things, make distributions to stockholders, repurchase its stock, incur other debt or liens, or acquire or
dispose of assets provided that the Company complies with certain requirements and limitations of the New Credit Agreement.
The Company’s domestic
subsidiaries have guaranteed the Company’s obligations under the New Credit Agreement, and the Company’s obligations and the
domestic subsidiaries’ guaranty are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the domestic assets of the Company and its domestic
subsidiaries.
As of December 31, 2022, $970.0
million was outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and approximately $3.7 million of the Revolving Credit Facility was being utilized
to provide letters of credit to secure the Company’s obligations relating to certain insurance programs, and the Company had the
ability to borrow up to an additional $496.3 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.
30
Senior Notes
On October 7, 2021, RBCA issued $500.0 million
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes were approximately $492.0 million
after deducting initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and offering expenses. On November 1, 2021, the Company used the proceeds
to fund a portion of the cash purchase price for the acquisition of Dodge.
The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, which contains covenants limiting
the ability of the Company to (i) incur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness, (ii) declare or pay dividends, redeem stock
or make other distributions to stockholders, (iii) make investments, (iv) create liens or use assets as security in other transactions,
(v) merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of its assets, (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates,
and (vii) sell or transfer certain assets. These covenants contain various exceptions, limitations and qualifications. At any time that
the Senior Notes are rated investment grade, certain of these covenants will be suspended.
The Senior Notes are guaranteed
jointly and severally on a senior unsecured basis by RBC Bearings and certain of RBCA’s existing and future wholly owned domestic
subsidiaries that also guarantee the New Credit Agreement.
Interest on the Senior Notes
accrues at a rate of 4.375% and is payable semi–annually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year.
The Senior Notes will mature
on October 15, 2029. The Company may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time on or after October 15, 2024 at the redemption
prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The Company may also
redeem up to 40% of the Senior Notes using the proceeds of certain equity offerings completed before October 15, 2024, at a redemption
price equal to 104.375% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
In addition, at any time prior to October 15, 2024, the Company may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of
the principal amount, plus a “make–whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date. If the Company sells certain of its assets or experiences specific kinds of changes in control, the Company must offer
to purchase the Senior Notes.
Foreign Revolving Credit Facility
The New Foreign Revolver is a CHF 5.0 million (approximately $5.4 million USD) revolving
credit facility with Credit Suisse (Switzerland) Ltd. to provide future working capital, if necessary. As of December 31, 2022, $0 had
been borrowed from the New Foreign Revolver. Fees associated with the New Foreign Revolver are nominal if the facility is not utilized.
Interest Rate Swap
The Company is exposed to
certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations, including market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates.
On October 28, 2022, the Company entered into a three-year USD-denominated
interest rate swap (“the Swap”) from a third-party financial counterparty under the New Credit Agreement. The Swap was executed
to protect the Company from interest rate volatility on our variable-rate Term Loan Facility. The Swap has an effective date of December
30, 2022 and is comprised of a $600.0 million notional with a maturity of three years. RBC will receive a variable rate based on one-month
Term SOFR and will pay a fixed rate of 4.455%. The notional on the Swap will amortize as follows:
Year 1: $600.0 million
Year 2: $400.0 million
Year 3: $100.0 million
The Swap has been designated
as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the first unhedged interest payments (the hedged transactions) paid over the hedging relationship’s
specified time period of three years attributable to the borrowing’s contractually specified interest index on the hedged principal
of its general borrowing program or replacement or refinancing thereof.

During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we generated cash of $149.3 million from operating
activities compared to $133.4 million of cash generated during the same period of fiscal 2022. The increase of $15.9 million was mainly
a result of an increase in net income of $94.3 million and a favorable change in non-cash activity of $6.2 million partially offset by
the unfavorable impact of the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $84.6 million. The unfavorable change in operating assets
and liabilities is detailed in the table below, while the increase in non-cash charges resulted from a $48.5 million increase in depreciation
and amortization and a $0.1 million increase in the loss on disposal of assets, partially offset by unfavorable changes of $17.5 million
of stock-based compensation charges, $11.4 million of amortization of deferred financing costs, $10.5 million in deferred taxes, $0.9
million related to the extinguishment of debt in the prior year and $2.1 million of consolidation, restructuring, and other noncash charges.
The following chart summarizes
the unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities of $84.6 million for fiscal 2023 versus fiscal 2022 and the favorable change

During the first nine months
of fiscal 2023, we used $1.6 million for investing activities as compared to using $2,839.5 million during the first nine months of fiscal
2022. This decrease in cash used compared to the prior year was attributable to $2,935.7 million less cash used for acquisitions, $30.0
million less purchases of marketable securities and $0.5 million more proceeds from the sale of assets partially offset by a $7.8 million
increase in capital expenditures and $120.5 million less in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we used $247.0 million in financing activities
compared to $2,810.3 million generated during the first nine months of fiscal 2022. This decrease from cash generated to cash used was
primarily attributable to proceeds received during the first nine months of fiscal 2022 related to $605.5 million from the issuance of
common stock, $445.3 million from the issuance of preferred stock, $1,286.2 million from the Term Loan Facility, and $494.2 million from
the Senior Notes. During fiscal 2023 there were $220.0 million more payments made on outstanding debt, $17.3 million cash dividends paid
on preferred stock, $7.3 million fewer exercises of stock-based awards, and $2.5 million more in principal payments made on finance lease
obligations, partially offset by $19.9 million less in finance fees paid in connection with credit facilities and term loans and $1.1
million fewer repurchases of common stock.
Capital Expenditures
Our capital expenditures were
$6.5 million and $29.6 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022, respectively. We expect to make additional
capital expenditures of $5.0 million to $10.0 million during the remainder of fiscal 2023 in connection with our existing business. We
expect to fund these capital expenditures principally through existing cash and internally generated funds. We may also make substantial
additional capital expenditures in connection with acquisitions.
32
Obligations and Commitments
The Company’s fixed contractual obligations and commitments are primarily comprised
of our debt obligations disclosed in Part I, Item 1- Note 10 of this report. We also have lease obligations which are materially consistent
with what we disclosed in our Annual Report.
Other Matters
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Preparation of our financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We believe
the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from
the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report describe the significant
accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Actual results in these areas could differ
from management’s estimates. There were no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates during the first nine months
of fiscal 2023.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has $3.7 million of outstanding standby letters of credit,
all of which are under the Revolving Credit Facility. We also have a contractual obligation for licenses related to the implementation
and upgrade of an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system for Dodge. These license costs of $10.5 million will be incurred
over a five-year period.
Other than the items noted
above, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks,
which arise during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
Interest Rates.
We currently have variable rate debt outstanding under the Term Loan
Facility. We regularly evaluate the impact of interest rate changes on our net income and cash flow and take action to limit our exposure
when appropriate. As discussed in Note 14 in Part I, Item I of this report, we entered into the Swap on October 28, 2022, which became
effective on December 30, 2022.
Foreign Currency Exchange
Rates.
Our operations in the following countries utilize the following currencies as their functional currency:
●
Australia – Australian dollar
●
India – rupee
●
Canada – Canadian dollar
●
Mexico – peso
●
China – Chinese yuan
●
Poland – zloty
●
France
– euro
●
Switzerland – Swiss franc
●
Germany – euro
As a result, we are exposed to risk associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates between
the U.S. dollar and these currencies. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in earnings. Approximately 11% and 12%
of our net sales were impacted by foreign currency fluctuations for both the three- and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2022, respectively,
compared to 12% and 11% for the three- and nine-month periods ended January 1, 2022, respectively. Foreign currency transaction exposure
arises primarily from the transfer of foreign currency from one subsidiary to another within the group, and to foreign currency denominated
trade receivables. Unrealized currency translation gains and losses are recognized upon translation of the foreign operations’ balance
sheets to U.S. dollars. Because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the
U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our earnings. We periodically enter into derivative
financial instruments in the form of forward exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates on certain third-party
sales transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no forward exchange contracts.
33
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2022. This evaluation excluded the Dodge business acquired on
November 1, 2021 as we are currently in the process of integrating the internal controls and procedures of Dodge into our internal controls
over financial reporting. As provided under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, we will
include the internal controls and procedures of Dodge in our annual assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting for our 2023 fiscal year.
Remediation of Material Weakness
To address the previously
reported material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described in Part I, Item 4 of the Company’s Form 10-Q for
the quarterly period ended July 2, 2022, the Company enhanced and revised the design of existing controls and procedures to properly review
employment agreements involving equity awards to ensure they are accounted for in accordance with the latest accounting pronouncements.
The Company’s internal audit department will test the operating effectiveness of management’s controls during the fiscal year.
Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting
Except for the changes related to the Company’s remediation efforts
described above, no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the third quarter of fiscal
2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).
As discussed in Note 13 included
in Part I, Item 1 of this report, we acquired Dodge on November 1, 2021. We are currently in the process of integrating the internal controls
and procedures of Dodge into our internal controls over financial reporting. As provided under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, we will include the internal controls and procedures of Dodge in our annual assessment of
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our 2023 fiscal year.
34
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we are
involved in litigation and administrative proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe that any
litigation or proceeding in which we are currently involved, either individually or in the aggregate, is likely to have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow or prospects.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
