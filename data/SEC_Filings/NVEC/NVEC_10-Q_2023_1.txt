NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
We develop and sell devices that use spintronics, a nanotechnology that relies on electron spin rather than electron charge to acquire, store, and transmit information.
NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited financial statements of NVE Corporation are prepared consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements. Although we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, certain disclosures have been omitted as allowed, and it is suggested that these unaudited financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes included in our latest annual financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. The results of operations for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year ending March 31, 2023.
Significant accounting policies
A description of our significant accounting policies is provided in Note 2 to the Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there were no changes to our significant accounting policies.
NOTE 3. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Recently Adopted Accounting Standard
In May 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2021-04,
Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options . ASU 2021-04 addresses issuers’ accounting for certain modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options. We adopted ASU 2021-04 beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The adoption had no material impact on our financial statements.
New Accounting Standard Not Yet Adopted
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Statements . ASU 2016-13 requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. In November 2018 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19,
Codification Improvements to Topic   326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses , which clarifies codification and corrects unintended application of the guidance, and in November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-11,
Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses , which clarifies or addresses specific issues about certain aspects of ASU 2016-13. In November 2019 the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10,
Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates , and in February 2020 the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-02,
Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic   326) and Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.   119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date Related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , both of which delay the effective date of ASU 2016-13 by three years for certain Smaller Reporting Companies such as us. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-03,
Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments ; which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. In accordance with ASU 2019-10 and ASU 2020-02, ASU 2016-13 is effective for certain Smaller Reporting Companies for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those fiscal years, which will be fiscal 2024 for us if we continue to be classified as a Smaller Reporting Company, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on our financial statements.

NOTE 5. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Our corporate bonds and money market funds are classified as available-for-sale securities and carried at estimated fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the statement of shareholders’ equity. Corporate bonds with remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short-term, and those with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long-term. We consider all highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including money market funds, to be cash equivalents. Gains and losses on marketable security transactions are reported on the specific-identification method.
Contractual maturities of available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2022 are as follows:
Total
<1 Year
1–3 Years
3–7 Years
$
52,020,382
$
10,853,140
$
25,270,655
$
15,896,587
Total available-for-sale securities represented approximately 79% of our total assets as of December 31, 2022. Marketable securities as of December 31, 2022 had remaining maturities between six days and 76 months.
Generally accepted accounting principles establish a framework for measuring fair value, provide a definition of fair value, and prescribe required disclosures about fair-value measurements. Generally accepted accounting principles define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Generally accepted accounting principles utilize a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The categories within the valuation hierarchy are described as follows:
Level 1 – Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities. Level 2 fair value measurements are determined using either prices for similar instruments or inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as interest rates.
Level 3 – Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable inputs or valuation techniques.
Money market funds are included on the balance sheets in “Cash and cash equivalents.” Corporate bonds are included on the balance sheets in “Marketable securities, short term” and “Marketable securities, long term.”

None of the securities were impaired at acquisition, and subsequent declines in fair value are not attributed to declines in credit quality. When evaluating for impairment we assess indicators that include, but are not limited to, earnings performance, changes in underlying credit ratings, market conditions, bona fide offers to purchase or sell, and ability to hold until maturity. Because we believe it is more likely than not we will recover the cost basis of our investments, we did not consider any of our marketable securities to be impaired as of December 31, 2022.

NOTE 7. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Stock-based compensation expense was $ 7,133
for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, $ 8,799
for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, $ 54,218
for the first nine months of fiscal 2023, and $ 73,036
for the first nine months of fiscal 2022. We calculate the share-based compensation expense using the Black-Scholes standard option-pricing model.
NOTE 8. INCOME TAXES
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2022, federal and state estimated tax overpayments of $ 291,000
were included in prepaid assets.
We had
no
unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022, and we do
no t expect any significant unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of the reporting date. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2022 we had
no
accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions. The tax years
2018
through
2022
remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
NOTE 9. LEASES
We conduct our operations in a leased facility under a non-cancellable lease expiring March 31, 2026. Our lease does not provide an implicit rate, so we used our incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of lease payments. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease costs consist primarily of common area maintenance and real estate taxes which are paid based on actual costs incurred by the lessor. Details of our operating lease are as follows:

NOTE 10. STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On January 21, 2009 we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 2,500,000
of our Common Stock from time to time in open market, block, or privately negotiated transactions. The timing and extent of any repurchases depends on market conditions, the trading price of the company’s stock, and other factors, and subject to the restrictions relating to volume, price, and timing under applicable law. On August 27, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized up to $5,000,000 of additional repurchases. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate us to purchase any shares. The Program may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice. We intend to finance any stock repurchases with cash provided by operating activities or maturating marketable securities. The remaining authorization was $ 3,598,519
as of December 31, 2022. We did
no t repurchase any of our Common Stock during the first nine months of fiscal 2023.

Forward-looking statements
Some of the statements made in this Report or in the documents incorporated by reference in this Report and in other materials filed or to be filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as well as information included in verbal or written statements made by us constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the reform act. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of the terminology such as may, will, expect, anticipate, intend, believe, estimate, should, or continue, or the negatives of these terms or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. To the extent that this Report contains forward-looking statements regarding the financial condition, operating results, business prospects or any other aspect of NVE, you should be aware that our actual financial condition, operating results and business performance may differ materially from that projected or estimated by us in the forward-looking statements. We have attempted to identify, in context, some of the factors that we currently believe may cause actual future experience and results to differ from their current expectations.

Total revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 (the third quarter of fiscal 2023) increased 18% compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2021 (the third quarter of fiscal 2022). The increase was due to a 22% increase in product sales, partially offset by a 46% decrease in contract research and development revenue. The increase in product sales was primarily due to increased purchases by existing customers and new customers. Sales increased in most of our markets and product lines. The decrease in contract research and development revenue was due to the completion of certain contracts.
Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 80% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 from 78% for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased prices and economies of scale due to increased revenue, partially offset by increased costs.
Total expenses increased 27% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022 due to an 18% increase in research and development expense and a 48% increase in selling, general, and administrative expense. The increases in expenses were primarily due to increased employee compensation expenses and increased staffing.
Interest income for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 43% due to an increase in our available-for-sale securities and an increase in their average interest rate.
The 22% increase in net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior-year quarter was primarily due to increased revenue and increased interest income, partially offset by increased expenses.

Total revenue for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 (the first nine months of fiscal 2023) increased 26% compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021 (the first nine months of fiscal 2022). The increase was due to a 27% increase in product sales, partially offset by a 13% decrease in contract research and development revenue. The increase in product sales was primarily due to increased purchases by existing customers and new customers. Sales increased in most of our markets and product lines. The decrease in contract research and development revenue was due to the completion of certain contracts.
Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 78% for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 from 77% for the first nine months of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased prices and economies of scale due to increased revenue, partially offset by increased costs.
Total expenses decreased 5% for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2022 due to an 7% decrease in research and development expense and a 1% decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense. The decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to the reallocation of resources to revenue-generating activities.
Interest income for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 increased 20% due to an increase in our available-for-sale securities and an increase in their average interest rate.
The 35% increase in net income in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior-year period was primarily due to increased revenue and increased interest income.
Supply Chain Disruptions
Supply chain disruptions may have favorably affected product sales in the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2022 since we believe the disruptions may have been less severe for us than for our competitors. We may be less susceptible to supply chain disruptions because we have our own wafer fabrication and product test operations. We believe supply chain disruptions had an unfavorable impact on our costs of sales.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Cash and cash equivalents were $2,029,714 as of December 31, 2022 compared to $10,449,510 as of March 31, 2022. The $8,419,796 decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 was due to $14,492,478 of cash used in financing activities for dividend payments and $8,676,229 of cash used by investing activities, partially offset by $14,748,911 in net cash provided by operating activities.
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities related to product sales and research and development contract revenue as our primary source of working capital for the current and prior-year quarters. Net cash provided by operating activities was $14,748,911 for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared to $9,098,330 for the first nine months of fiscal 2022.
Accounts receivable decreased $2,607,555 during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 primarily due to the timing of customer payments.
Inventories increased $1,370,592 due primarily to our decision to increase inventories to support increased product sales and to mitigate longer supplier lead-times and supply-chain risks.
Investing Activities
Cash used by investing activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 consisted of $26,618,617 of marketable securities purchases and $907,612 of fixed asset purchases, partially offset by $18,750,000 in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and the receipt of a $100,000 tenant improvement allowance. Purchases of fixed assets were primarily capital expenditures for additional production equipment to increase our manufacturing capacity.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 consisted of $14,492,478 of cash dividends paid to shareholders.
In addition to cash dividends to shareholders paid in third quarter of fiscal 2023, on January 25, 2023 we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a cash dividend of $1.00 per share of Common Stock, or $4,830,826 based on shares outstanding as of January 20, 2023, to be paid February 28, 2023.
We plan to fund dividends through cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from maturities of marketable securities. All future dividends will be subject to Board approval and subject to the company’s results of operations, cash and marketable security balances, estimates of future cash requirements, and other factors the Board may deem relevant. Furthermore, dividends may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has performed an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures that are defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. This evaluation included consideration of the controls, processes, and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Although there have been changes in personnel involved in our controls, processes, and procedures, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Changes in Internal Controls
During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
In the ordinary course of business, we may become involved in litigation. At this time, we are not aware of any material pending or threatened legal proceedings or other proceedings contemplated by governmental authorities that we expect would have a material adverse impact on our future results of operation and financial condition.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, except the following risk factor is replaced in its entirety by the following to reflect an amendment to an agreement with Abbott Laboratories, which extends the Agreement term through December 31, 2023:
We may lose revenue if we are unable to renew customer agreements.
We have agreements with certain customers, including a Supplier Partnering Agreement, as amended, with Abbott Laboratories, which expires December 31, 2023. We cannot predict if these agreements will be renewed, or if renewed, under what terms. Although it is possible we could continue to sell products to these customers without formal agreements, an inability to agree on mutually acceptable terms could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue or profitability.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.
None.
