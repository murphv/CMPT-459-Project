7 Table of Contents   FIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION   NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE A - BUSINESS DESCRIPTION   First America Resources Corporation (the “Company”) formerly known as Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc., was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on May 10, 2010 with registered address at 1955 Baring Blvd., Sparks, NV 89434. First America Resources Corporation has its mailing address at 1000 E. Armstrong Street, Morris IL 60450.   The Company was previously engaged in selling the lithium-ion batteries and related power supplies that mainly are used in mobile and consumer electronics products, such as readers, DVD players, digital cameras and digital video recorders, communications products, electric-power bikes and mopeds, miner’s lamps, electric-power tools, electric-power sources for instruments and meters and other similar electrical equipment that can run on batteries.   On February 6, 2013, pursuant to an Agreement between Mr. Keming Li, former CEO/President and Director of Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Issuer”), Ms. Guoling Jin, former Treasury and Director of Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc., and Ms. Madison Li (the stockholder), of Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc., and Mr. Jian Li (the “Purchaser”), Mr. Jian Li became the principal stockholder and Chief Executive Officer and Tzongshyan George Sheu the former Vice President, Secretary, and Director of the Company.   Going Concern and Plan of Operation   The Company’s financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not earned any profit from operations to date. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of accounting   The financial statements reflect the assets, revenues and expenditures of the Company on the accrual basis of accounting.   The Company’s fiscal year end is June 30.   The accompanying unaudited condensed interim financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information, and with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission set forth in Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited condensed interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. These unaudited condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended June 30, 2022 and notes thereto contained in our 10-K Annual Report.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts reported in the financial statements and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.
8 Table of Contents   FIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION   NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)   The extent to which the COVID- 19  pandemic will impact our business going forward depends on numerous dynamic factors which we cannot reliably predict. As a result, some of our estimates and assumptions required increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As the events continue to evolve with respect to the pandemic, our estimates  may  materially change in future periods.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, there was $
4,601
and $
15,847
in cash, respectively. The Company has no Cash Equivalents as of December 31,2022.   Stock-Based Compensation   The Company accounts for stock issued for services using the fair value method in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation”. The measurement date of shares issued for services is the date at which the counterparty’s performance is complete.   Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share   The Company computes per share amounts in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share”. ASC 260 requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS.   Basic EPS is computed by dividing the income (loss) available to Common Shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the periods.   As of December 31, 2022, the Company only issued one type of shares, i.e., common shares only. There is no other type of securities issued. Accordingly, the diluted and basic net loss per common share is the same.   Revenue Recognition   Revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 606. The Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company applies the five-step model to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Topic 606, including when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, the Company evaluates the goods or services promised within each contract related performance obligation and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company recognizes as revenue, the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.   Cost of Goods Sold   Cost of Goods Sold included the purchase cost of the product sold, freight and shipping expense, custom fees, and merchant account fees.   For the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was no Cost of Goods Sold recorded.     9 Table of Contents   FIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION   NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)   Operating Expenses   Operating expenses consist of selling, general and administrative expenses, mainly accounting and auditing fees, legal fees, SEC filing fees, and other professional fees.   For the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred $ 3,373
and $ 2,623
in operating expenses, respectively.
Operating Leases   After February 6, 2013, the Company moved to the new address located at 1000 E. Armstrong St., Morris, IL 60450. There was no lease signed between the Company and the property owner, Jian Li, who is also the majority shareholder of the Company.   Income Tax   Income taxes are provided for tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes. Deferred taxes are recognized for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. The differences in asset and liability basis relate primarily to organization and start-up costs (use of different methods and periods to calculate deduction). Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses and tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes. The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. The components of the deferred tax asset and liability are classified as current and noncurrent based on their characteristics. Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets based on management’s projection of the sufficiency of future taxable income to realize the assets. The Company policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” (“ASU 2016-02”). This guidance requires an entity to recognize lease liabilities and a right-of-use asset for all leases on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity’s leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after the date of initial adoption, with an option to elect to use certain transition relief. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with earlier adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU effective July 1, 2019. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.     10 Table of Contents    FIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION   NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

7,964,090
shares issued and outstanding.     11 Table of Contents    FIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION   NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE E - GOING CONCERN   The Company’s activities consist solely of corporate formation, raising capital and attempting to sell products to generate revenues.   There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise enough capital or generate revenues to sustain its operations and carry out its business plan. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issue date of these financial statements.   The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the carrying amounts of recorded assets or the carrying amounts and classification of recorded liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no revenues, a working capital deficiency of $ 224,432
and an accumulated deficit of $ 423,256 . And as of June 30, 2022, a working capital deficiency of $ 213,186 , and an accumulated deficit of $ 412,010   The Company’s lack of operating history and financial resources raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans are to acquire FAMCe (formerly known as First America Metal Corporation), a company owned primarily by Mr. Jian Li, or another operating company. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if the Company is unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing, then the Company may be required to cease or curtail its operations.   NOTE F – INCOME TAXES   The Company has a net operating loss carried forward of $ 423,224
available to offset taxable income in future years which commence expiring in fiscal 2032.   The income tax benefit has been computed by applying the weighted average income tax rates of the United States (federal and state rates) of
21 % to the net loss before income taxes calculated for each jurisdiction. The tax effect of the significant temporary differences, which comprise future tax assets and liabilities, are as follows:       Three Months Ended       December,       2022     2021   Income tax recovery at statutory rate   $ 708     $ 551                     Valuation allowance change   $ ( 708 )   $ ( 551 )                   Provision for income taxes   $ -     $ -     The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are as follows:   Net operating loss carried forward   $ 88,877     $ 85,249                     Valuation allowance   $ ( 88,877

Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation.   The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes, and other financial information included in this Form 10-Q.   Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Although the forward-looking statements in this Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.   Overview   First America Resources Corporation is a Nevada corporation formed on May 10, 2010, with registered address at 1955 Baring Blvd, Sparks, Nevada 89434. First America Resources Corporation has offices at 1000 East Armstrong Street, Morris, IL 60450, and contact telephone number 815-941-9888.   The Corporation was originally known as Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc. when formed. The Corporation amended its Articles of Incorporation as follows: The Corporation changed its name from Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc. to First America Resources Corporation. The effective date of the amendment was when final approval from FINRA was received, which was August 26, 2014.   We were previously engaged in selling the lithium-ion batteries and related power supplies that mainly are used in mobile and consumer electronics products, such as readers, DVD players, digital cameras and digital video recorders, communications products, electric-power bikes and mopeds, miner’s lamps, electric-power tools, electric-power sources for instruments and meters and other similar electrical equipment that can run on batteries.   On February 6, 2013, pursuant to an Agreement between Mr. Keming Li, former CEO/President and Director of Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Issuer”), Ms. Guoling Jin, former Treasury and Director of Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc., and Ms. Madison Li (the stockholder) of Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc., and Mr. Jian Li (the “Purchaser”), Mr. Jian Li became the principal stockholder and Chief Executive Officer and Tzongshyan George Sheu the former Vice-President, Secretary of the Company and a Director on the Board of Directors of the Company as well.   In connection with this change of control, we discontinued our current business. It is anticipated we will acquire FAMCe (formerly known as First America Metal Corporation), a business owned primarily by Mr. Jian Li, or another operating company, depending upon completion of audit and preparation of required filing on Form 8-K, which we currently hope to complete in the next 12 months but may take longer than such currently anticipated dates.   FAMCe  in Morris, IL is an international scrap metal company specializing in recycling of non-ferrous and electronic material and has become one large exporter of scrap metal in the Midwest. FAMCe is operating a business branch in Fort Worth, Texas since November 2014 and operating the Georgia branch since January 2016. Management anticipates that after acquisition we will be competitive in pricing of some or all of the following, depending upon market conditions which can change, even rapidly, from time-to-time: Copper, Brass, Stainless, Aluminum, High Temp Alloys, Zinc, Tin, Cobalt, Tungsten Alloys, and electronic material.     13 Table of Contents    Recent Developments   In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and the world. The spread of COVID-19 has initially caused significant volatility in U.S. and international markets and has resulted in large scale business disruption. There is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the U.S. and global economies.   The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused many governments to implement stay-at-home orders and quarantines and place significant restrictions on travel. Many of these governments have also implemented work restrictions that prohibit or limit non-essential businesses from conducting normal operations, which has required employees to work remotely if possible or be terminated or furloughed. Some restrictions were relaxed during the summer months but have begun to be re-implemented as a result of increasing infection rates throughout the world. The Company is supported by the employees of FAMCe (formerly known as First America Metal Corporation), a business owned primarily by Mr. Jian Li.  The health and safety of the employees of FAMCe will continue to be its highest priority throughout the pandemic. FAMCe has implemented protective measures relating to its workforce including, but not limited to, health monitoring, personal protective equipment, and enhanced cleaning and sanitizing procedures among other measures recommended by various federal, state and local governments.   Results of Operations   For the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:   Revenue   The Company had zero sales revenue for the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   Cost of Revenue   The Company had zero cost of goods sold for the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   Expenses   Our expenses consist of selling, general and administrative expenses as follows:   For the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were total of $3,373 and $2,623 operating expenses, respectively.   Detail is shown in the below table:       Quarter Ended     Quarter Ended       December  31 ,     December  31 ,       2022     2021   Expense             Bank Service Charges   $  -

We expect selling, general, and administrative expenses to increase in future periods if and when we close our planned acquisition as described above.     14 Table of Contents    Income & Operation Taxes   We are subject to income taxes in the U.S.   We paid no income taxes in USA for the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to the net operation loss in USA.   Net Loss   We incurred net losses of $3,373 and $2,623 for the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.   Liquidity and Capital Resources       At December 31, 2022     At June 30,  2022                 Current Ratio     0.02       0.07   Cash   $ 4,601     $ 15,847   Working Capital   $ (224,432 )   $ (213,186 ) Total Assets   $ 4,601     $ 15,847   Total Liabilities   $ 229,033     $ 229,033                     Total Equity   $ (224,432 )   $ (213,186 )                   Total Debt/Equity     -1.02       -1.07                     Current Ratio = Current Asset / Current Liabilities Working Capital = Current asset - Current Liabilities

15 Table of Contents    The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $4,601 at December 31, 2022 and negative working capital of $224,432. There were total liabilities of $229,033 at December 31, 2022. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $15,847 at June 30, 2022 and negative working capital of $213,186. There were total liabilities of $229,033 at June 30, 2022.   Until we generate operating revenues or receive other financing, all our costs, which we will incur irrespective of our business development activities, including bank service fees and those costs associated with SEC requirements associated with staying public, will be funded by Jian Li, our President and Director. Mr. Li is not obligated to pay these costs and any costs advanced will be treated as a demand loan with to be agreed interest. These costs are estimated to be less than $50,000 annually until we close our potential acquisition. If we fail to meet these requirements, we will be unable to secure a qualification for quotation of our securities on the over the counter bulletin board, or if we have secured a qualification, may lose the qualification and our securities would no longer trade on the over the counter bulletin board. Further, if we fail to meet these obligations and as a consequence we fail to satisfy our SEC reporting obligations, investors will now own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC and investors may have increased difficulty in selling their stock as we will be non-reporting.   At December 31, 2022, we owe Mr. Li an aggregate of $228,933 on these loans, which are oral and bear no interest, due upon demand.   After our potential acquisition, we may still need to secure additional debt or equity funding. We do not have any plans or specific agreements for new sources of funding, except for the anticipated loans from management as described above.   Our lack of revenues and cash raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations.   The Company’s lack of operating history and financial resources raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.     16 Table of Contents    Item 3.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   The Company has established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q was properly recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. The Company’s controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) at December 31, 2022 based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer concluded that, at December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective.   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.     17 Table of Contents    PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1.
