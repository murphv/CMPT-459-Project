31 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Quarterly Report”) includes statements of our expectations, intentions, plans, projections, guidance and beliefs that constitute “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements are principally, but not solely, contained in the section captioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our strategies, plans, objectives, expectations, projections, guidance, intentions, expenditures and assumptions and other statements contained herein that are not historical facts. Our forward-looking statements are generally, but not always, accompanied by words such as, but not limited to, “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend” “may,” “might,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “possible,” “project,” “predict,” “potential,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions or phrases, or the negative of those expressions or phrases, or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes, which are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, guidance and projections and related assumptions, about future events and financial trends. While our management considers these expectations, guidance, projections and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that actual developments will be as we anticipate. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements as a result of significant risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: • our ability to qualify for and obtain broadband licenses from the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) in accordance with the requirements of the Report and Order approved by the FCC on May 13, 2020 (the “Report and Order”); • our ability to successfully commercialize our spectrum assets to our targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers on a timely basis and on commercially favorable terms, including our ability to lease our spectrum on financial terms consistent with our business plan and assumptions; • our ability to fulfill the platform initiatives of our Integrated Platform to drive industrywide 900 MHz private broadband innovations and solutions; • our ability to correctly estimate our revenues and operating expenses and our future financial needs; • our ability to achieve our operating and financial projections and guidance; • our ability to support our future operations and business plans and return capital to our stockholders through our share repurchase program with our existing cash resources and the proceeds we generate from our commercial operations without the need to raise additional capital through the issuance of stock or debt securities; • the extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and negative macroeconomic pressures, including inflation, on our business and on our potential customers’ businesses, may continue to adversely affect our commercialization efforts and our results of operations; • our ability to retune or relocate incumbent narrowband licensees in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; • our ability to satisfy our obligations, including the delivery of cleared spectrum and broadband licenses, and the other contingencies required by our commercial agreements with Ameren Corporation (“Ameren”), San Diego Gas & Electric Company, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy (“SDG&E”), Evergy, Inc. (“Evergy”), and Xcel Energy Services Inc. (“Xcel Energy”) on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms; • whether federal and state agencies and commissions will support the deployment of broadband networks and services by our targeted customers; • our ability to maintain any narrowband and broadband licenses that we own, acquire and/or obtain from the FCC; • government regulations or actions taken by governmental bodies could adversely affect our business prospects, liquidity and results of operations, including any changes by the FCC to the Report and Order or to the FCC rules and regulations governing the 900 MHz band; • our ability to successfully compete against the third parties who offer spectrum and communication technologies, products and solutions to our targeted customers; • our ability to successfully manage our planned growth; • the ability to develop and sustain a robust market for our common stock; 3 Table of Contents • factors that may cause our common stock price to be volatile or cause the value of our common stock to decline; • the expected timing and amount of purchases and the related impact to our common stock relating to our share repurchase program; and • how the concentrated ownership of our common stock may limit stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Many of these risks, uncertainties and other factors are beyond our ability to control, influence, or predict. The most significant of these risks, uncertainties and other factors are described in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in Part II of this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on May 26, 2022. As a result, investors are urged not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect our views and assumptions only as of the date such forward-looking statements were made. Except to the limited extent required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

1.     Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation Anterix Inc. (the “Company”) is a wireless communications company focused on commercializing its spectrum assets to enable its targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers to deploy private broadband networks and on offering innovative broadband technologies and solutions to the same target customers. The Company is the largest holder of licensed spectrum in the 900 MHz band (896 - 901 / 935 - 940 MHz) with nationwide coverage throughout the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico. On May 13, 2020, the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) approved the Report and Order (the “Report and Order”) to modernize and realign the 900 MHz band to increase its usability and capacity by allowing it to be utilized for the deployment of broadband networks, technologies and solutions. The Report and Order was published in the Federal Register on July 16, 2020 and became effective on August 17, 2020. The Company is now engaged in qualifying for and securing broadband licenses from the FCC. At the same time, the Company is pursuing opportunities to lease the broadband spectrum it secures to its targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers. The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1997 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2014. In November 2015, the Company changed its name from Pacific DataVision, Inc. to pdvWireless, Inc. In August 2019, the Company changed its name from pdvWireless, Inc. to Anterix Inc. The Company maintains offices in Woodland Park, New Jersey, McLean, Virginia and Abilene, Texas. Business Developments On October 28, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Xcel Energy Services Inc. (“Xcel Energy”) providing Xcel Energy dedicated long-term usage of the Company’s 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum for a term of
20
years throughout Xcel Energy’s service territory in eight states (the “Xcel Energy Agreement”). The Xcel Energy Agreement also provides Xcel Energy an option to extend the agreement for
two
10-year
terms for additional payments. The Xcel Energy Agreement allows Xcel Energy to deploy a private LTE network to support its grid modernization initiatives for the benefit of its approximately
3.7  million electricity customers and
2.1  million natural gas customers. The scheduled prepayments for the
20-year
initial term of the Xcel Energy Agreement total $ 80.0  million, of which $ 8.0  million was received by the Company in December 2022. See Note 2
Revenue
for further discussion on the Xcel Energy Agreement. In September 2021, the Company entered into a long-term lease agreement of 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum with Evergy, Inc. (“Evergy”) (the “Evergy Agreement”). The Evergy service territories covered by the Evergy Agreement are in Kansas and Missouri with a population of approximately
3.9  million people. The Evergy Agreement is for a term of up to
40
years, comprised of an initial term of
20
years and
two
10-year
renewal options for additional payments. The Company received full prepayment of $ 30.2  million for the initial
20-year
term in October 2021. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company leased to Evergy the first deliverable of 1.4 x 1.4 cleared Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses for
70
counties. The revenue recognized for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $ 0.2  million and $ 0.3  million, respectively. In February 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with San Diego Gas & Electric Company, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy (“SDG&E”), to provide 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum throughout SDG&E’s California service territory, including San Diego and Imperial Counties and portions of Orange County for a total payment of $ 50.0  million. The total payment of $ 50.0  million is comprised of an initial payment of $ 20.0  million received in February 2021 and the remaining $ 30.0  million payment, which is due through fiscal year 2024 as the Company delivers the associated broadband licenses to SDG&E and the relevant cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum. During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company delivered to SDG&E 1.4 x 1.4 cleared Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband license related to Imperial County and received a milestone payment of $ 0.2  million. See Note 9
Contingencies
for further discussion. In May 2022, the Company issued Motorola
500,000
shares of its common stock (the “Shares”). Motorola received the Shares by electing to convert
500,000
Class B Units (the “Units”) it held in the Company’s subsidiary, PDV Spectrum Holding Company, LLC (the “Subsidiary”). Motorola acquired the Units in September 2014 in connection with a Spectrum Lease Agreement between Motorola and the Subsidiary (the “2014 Motorola Spectrum
10 Table of Contents Agreement”). Under the 2014 Motorola Spectrum Agreement, Motorola leased a portion of the Company’s narrowband spectrum, which was held by the Subsidiary, in consideration for an upfront, fully-paid leasing fee of $ 7.5  million and a $ 10.0  million investment in the Units. Motorola had the right at any time to convert its Units into the Shares, representing a conversion price of $ 20.00
per share. Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates The unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information. Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. Because certain information and footnote disclosures have been condensed or omitted, these unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on May 26, 2022 (the “2022 Annual Report”). In the Company’s opinion all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented have been included. The Company believes that the disclosures made in the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements are adequate to make the information not misleading. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year. The Company is also required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the report amounts. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the applicable period. Accordingly, actual results could materially differ from those estimates. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13,
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
(“ASU 2016-13”), and has subsequently modified several areas of the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326,
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses , in order to provide additional clarity and improvements. The new standard requires entities to use a Current Expected Credit Loss impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under this model, an entity would recognize an impairment allowance equal to its current estimate of all contractual cash flows that the entity does not expect to collect from financial assets measured at amortized cost within the scope of the standard. The entity’s estimate would consider relevant information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, which will result in recognition of lifetime expected credit losses. As the Company was previously a smaller reporting company, the standard updates would have been effective beginning April 2023, however, due to the transition to a large accelerated filer during the 2022 fiscal year, the updates were effective for the Company as of the fiscal year end 2022. The Company adopted the new standard effective March 31, 2022, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
While there have been accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date, these updates are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 11 Table of Contents 2.     Revenue The following table provides information regarding the Company’s revenue for each of the services it provides pursuant to its spectrum revenue agreements for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):   Three months ended December 31, Nine months ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Spectrum revenues 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum Revenue Ameren $ 152 $ 202 $ 457 $ 202 Evergy (1) 244 — 308 — Narrowband Spectrum Revenue Motorola 182 183 546 547 Total spectrum revenue (2) $ 578 $ 385 $ 1,311 $ 749 1. The Company commenced revenue recognition in connection with the delivery of cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses to Evergy for
70
counties.
2. Revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the respective periods.
Spectrum Revenue Agreements Refer to the Company’s 2022 Annual Report for a description of the Company’s spectrum revenue agreements entered into prior to March 31, 2022. The following reflects agreements entered into during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. On October 28, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Xcel Energy providing Xcel Energy dedicated long-term usage of the Company’s 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum for a term of
20
years throughout Xcel Energy’s service territory in eight states including Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. The Xcel Energy Agreement also provides Xcel Energy an option to extend the agreement for
two
10-year
terms for additional payments. The Xcel Energy Agreement allows Xcel Energy to deploy a private LTE network to support its grid modernization initiatives for the benefit of its approximately
3.7  million electricity customers and
2.1  million natural gas customers. The scheduled prepayments for the
20-year
initial terms of the Xcel Energy Agreement total $ 80.0  million, of which $ 8.0  million was received by the Company in December 2022. The remaining prepayments for the
20-year
initial term are due by mid-2028, per the terms of the Xcel Energy Agreement and as the Company delivers the relevant cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses. The Company is working with incumbents to clear the 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum allocation in Xcel Energy service territories. In accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the payments of prepaid fees under the Xcel Energy Agreement will be accounted for as deferred revenue on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenue will be recognized over time as the performance obligations of clearing the 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses are delivered by respective county, over the contractual term of approximately
20
years. Contract Assets The Company recognizes a contract asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs include sales commissions and stock compensation. These costs are amortized ratably using the portfolio approach over the estimated customer contract period. The Company will review the contract asset on a periodic basis to determine if an impairment exists, and subsequent to the Company’s adoption of ASU 2016-13, will review the contract assets for potential credit loss exposure. If it is determined that there is an impairment, or a potential credit loss, the Company will expense the contract asset. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred and capitalized commission costs and stock compensation related to activities to obtain its long-term 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum lease agreements amounting to approximately $ 109,000
and $ 129,000 , respectively. These capitalized costs will be amortized over the contractual term upon the commencement of the associated agreements. 12 Table of Contents The following table presents the activity for the Company’s contract assets (in thousands):
Contract Assets Balance at March 31, 2022 $ 638 Additions 109 Amortization ( 11 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 736 Less amount classified as current assets - prepaid expenses and other current assets ( 347 ) Noncurrent assets - included in other assets $ 389 Contract liabilities Contract liabilities primarily relate to advance consideration received from customers for spectrum services, for which revenue is recognized over time, as the services are performed. These contract liabilities are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, deferred revenue increased by $ 8.0  million as a result of prepayments received in connection with the Xcel Energy Agreement. For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, deferred revenue increased by $ 52.8  million as a result of prepayments received in connection with the Ameren Corporation (“Ameren”) and Evergy lease agreements. The following table presents the activity for the Company’s contract liabilities (in thousands):   Contract Liabilities Balance at March 31, 2022 $ 54,678 Additions 8,000 Revenue recognized ( 1,311 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 61,367 Less amount classified as current liabilities ( 2,656 ) Noncurrent liabilities $ 58,711 3.     Intangible Assets Wireless licenses are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but instead are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event indicates that the asset might be impaired. There were
no
triggering events indicating impairment during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired wireless licenses for cash consideration of $ 9.2
million, after receiving FCC approval, of which $ 7.0
million was spent on licenses acquired, including costs associated with license swaps, by entering into agreements with several third parties in multiple U.S. markets and $ 2.2
million was paid to the U.S. Treasury for Anti-Windfall payments, i.e. payments to cover any shortfall of channels needed in a given county to reach the requisite
240
channels required to be surrendered to secure a broadband license for such county. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company recorded initial deposits to incumbents amounting to approximately $ 13.3
million and $ 8.0
million, respectively, that are refundable if the FCC does not approve the sale, swap or retuning of the spectrum. Of the $ 13.3
million initial refundable deposit balance as of December 31, 2022, $ 12.7
million was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the remaining $ 0.6
million in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Of the $ 8.0
million initial refundable deposit balance as of March 31, 2022, $ 7.6
million was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the remaining $ 0.4
million in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company recorded deferred charges of $ 8.0
million and $ 3.4
million, respectively, related to closed retuning deals, of which $ 0.6
million and $ 0.2
million, respectively, was recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $ 7.4
million and $ 3.1
million, respectively, was recorded in other assets.
13 Table of Contents During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company applied for, and was granted by the FCC, broadband licenses for
70
counties in connection with the long-term lease agreement with Evergy. The Company recorded the new broadband licenses collectively at their estimated accounting cost basis of approximately $ 13.1
million. In connection with receiving the broadband licenses, the Company disposed of $ 3.8
million of the value ascribed to the narrowband licenses it relinquished to the FCC for the same
70
counties. The total carrying value of narrowband licenses included the cost to acquire the original narrowband licenses, Anti-Windfall payments paid to cover the shortfall in each county and the clearing costs. As a result of the exchanges of narrowband licenses for broadband licenses, the Company recorded a non-monetary gain on the disposal of intangible assets of $ 5.8
million and $ 9.3
million, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Intangible assets consist of the following activity for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands):   Wireless Licenses Balance at March 31, 2022 $ 151,169 Acquisitions 9,159 Exchanges – broadband licenses received 13,107 Exchanges – narrowband licenses surrendered ( 3,778 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 169,657 4.     Related Party Transactions Refer to the Company’s 2022 Annual Report for a more complete description of the nature of its related party transactions prior to March 31, 2022. The following reflects the related party activity during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. In connection with the Service Revenue Transfer, the Company was obligated to pay a monthly service fee for a
24 -month period that ended on January 7, 2021, for its assumption of support obligations under the transfer agreements. The Company is also obligated to pay a certain portion of the billed revenue received by the Company from pdvConnect customers for a
48 -month period. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred payments of $ 15,000
and $ 45,000 , respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company did
not
have outstanding liabilities to the related parties associated with the service transfer. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased equipment from Motorola in the amount of $ 910,000 . In addition, the Company entered into a Frequency Relocation Agreement with Motorola for a total amount of $ 967,000 , of which the Company paid $ 97,000
during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company owed $ 120,000
to Motorola, unrelated to the Frequency Relocation Agreement. During 2020, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Rachelle B. Chong under which Ms. Chong serves as a Senior Advisor to the Company’s management team, subsequent to her resignation from the Company’s Board and as a member of the Board’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. In July 2022, the Company extended the agreement by an additional
12
months with a new termination date of May 14, 2023. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred $ 36,000
and $ 108,000
in consulting fees to Ms. Chong, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company did
not
have any outstanding liabilities to Ms. Chong. During 2020, the Company entered into an annual consulting agreement with Brian D. McAuley under which Mr. McAuley serves as a Senior Advisor to the Company’s management team and provide strategic, corporate governance and Board advisory services, subsequent to his resignation as Executive Chairman of the Board. In July 2022, the Company extended the agreement by an additional
12
months with a new termination date of September 1, 2023. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred $ 10,000
and $ 30,000
in consulting fees to Mr. McAuley, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company did
not
have any outstanding liabilities to Mr. McAuley. 14 Table of Contents 5.     Leases All leases in which the Company is the lessee are comprised of corporate office space and tower space. The Company is obligated under certain lease agreements for office space with lease terms expiring on various dates from October 31, 2023 through June 30, 2027, which includes lease extensions for its corporate headquarters ranging from
three
to
ten years . The Company entered into multiple lease agreements for tower space with lease expiration dates ranging from January 15, 2023 to August 31, 2029. All of the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases, and as such, were previously not recognized on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. With the adoption of ASC 842 Leases, operating lease agreements are required to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as right of use (“ROU”) assets and corresponding lease liabilities. ROU assets include any prepaid lease payments and exclude any lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Weighted-average remaining lease term and incremental borrowing rate for the Company’s operating leases are as follows:   Nine months ended December 31,   2022 2021 Weighted average term - operating lease liabilities 3.01
years 3.78
years Weighted average incremental borrowing rate - operating lease liabilities 12 % 13 % Rent expense amounted to approximately $ 0.5
million and $ 1.4
million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, which is included in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Rent expense amounted to approximately $ 0.5
million and $ 1.5
million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, which is included in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The following table presents net lease cost for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):   Three months ended December 31, Nine months ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Lease cost Operating lease cost (cost resulting from lease payments) $ 461 $ 485 $ 1,355 $ 1,493 Short term lease cost — 3 7 13 Net lease cost $ 461 $ 488 $ 1,362 $ 1,506 The following table presents supplemental cash flow and non-cash activity information for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):   Nine months ended December 31,   2022 2021 Cash paid activity: Operating lease - operating cash flows (fixed payments) $ 1,634 $ 1,719 Operating lease - operating cash flows (liability reduction) $ 747 $ 1,087 Non-cash activity: Right of use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities
$ 165 $ 78 15 Table of Contents The following table presents supplemental balance sheet information as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 (in thousands):   December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Non-current assets - right of use assets, net $ 3,567 $ 4,047 Current liabilities - operating lease liabilities $ 1,749 $ 1,512 Non-current liabilities - operating lease liabilities $ 3,193 $ 4,177 Future minimum payments under non-cancelable leases for office and tower spaces (exclusive of real estate tax, utilities, maintenance and other costs borne by the Company) for the remaining terms of the leases following the nine months ended December 31, 2022, are as follows (in thousands):
Fiscal Year Operating Leases 2023 (excluding the nine months ended December 31, 2022) $ 567 2024 2,128 2025 1,661 2026 902 2027 497 After 2027 174 Total future minimum lease payments 5,929 Amount representing interest ( 987 ) Present value of net future minimum lease payments $ 4,942 6.     Income Taxes The Company used a discrete effective tax rate method to calculate taxes for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022. The Company determined that applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate would not provide a reasonable estimate as small changes in estimated “ordinary” loss could result in significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate. Accordingly, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a total deferred tax expense of $ 0.2
million and $ 0.6
million, respectively, due to the inability to use some portion of its federal and state NOL carryforwards against the deferred tax liability created by the amortization of indefinite-lived intangibles. The Company’s net operating losses (“NOLs”) generated after March 31, 2018 may be used as an indefinite-lived asset to offset its deferred tax liability but are limited to 80% of future taxable income. The deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2022 are approximately $ 2.6
million for federal and $ 2.2
million for state. 7.     Stockholders’ Equity
The Company established the 2014 Stock Plan (the “2014 Stock Plan”) to attract, retain and reward individuals who contribute to the achievement of the Company’s goals and objectives. This 2014 Stock Plan superseded previous stock plans. The Board has reserved
5,027,201
shares of common stock for issuance under the 2014 Stock Plan as of December 31, 2022, of which
490,704
shares are available for future issuance. Historically, the number of shares reserved under the 2014 Stock Plan were increased, based on Board approval, each January 1 by an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
5 % of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 or (ii) a lesser amount determined by the Board (the “evergreen provision”). Effective January 1, 2021, the Board elected to increase the shares authorized under the 2014 Stock Plan by
879,216
shares, which represented
5 % of the of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020. On June 14, 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board approved Amendment No. 1 to 2014 Stock Plan to eliminate the evergreen provision for all future years (i.e., January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2024). 16 Table of Contents During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended March 31, 2022, a total of
207,231
and
979,320
shares, respectively, were issued in connection with the vesting, conversion and or exercise of grants under the Company’s 2014 Stock Plan. Share retirement In May 2021, the Company reacquired
20,132
shares when a participant surrendered already-owned shares of the Company’s common stock to cover the exercise price of an outstanding stock option exercised by the participant. The
20,132
shares surrendered were constructively retired by the Company as of June 30, 2021, which resulted in the non-cash reduction of approximately $ 1.0
million in accumulated deficit in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’ Equity. As discussed in Note 1
Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation , the Company has reclassified the reduction to additional paid in capital to accumulated deficit and presented this as a correction of an error.
Share repurchase program In September 2021, the Board authorized a share repurchase program (the “share repurchase program”) pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to $ 50.0
million of the Company’s common stock on or before September 29, 2023. The manner, timing and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by the Company based on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions and alternative investment opportunities. The share repurchase program authorization does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The following table presents the share repurchase activity for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except per share data):   Three months ended December 31, Nine months ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Number of shares repurchased and retired 106 200 216 200 Average price paid per share* $ 33.11 $ 60.02 $ 47.05 $ 60.02 Total cost to repurchase $ 3,498 $ 11,993 $ 8,223 $ 11,993 * Average price paid per share includes costs associated with the repurchase.
As of December 31, 2022, $ 26.8  million is remaining under the share repurchase program. Motorola Shares In September 2014, Motorola invested $ 10.0  million to purchase
500,000
Class B Units of the Company’s Subsidiary (at a price equal to $ 20.00
per unit). The Company owns
100 % of the Class A Units in the Subsidiary. Motorola had the right at any time to convert its
500,000
Class B Units into
500,000
shares of the Company’s common stock and in May 2022, Motorola exercised such right to convert its
500,000
Class B Units into
500,000
shares of the Company’s common stock. In June 2022, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 to register the
500,000
shares of the Company’s Common Stock held by Motorola for the resale or other disposition of such shares by Motorola (the “Resale Registration Statement”). The Resale Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on July 15, 2022. 8.     Net Loss Per Share of Common Stock Basic net loss per common share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for potentially dilutive securities. For purposes of the diluted net loss per share calculation, preferred stock, stock options, restricted stock and warrants are considered to be potentially dilutive securities. Because the Company has reported a net loss for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share for those periods. 17 Table of Contents Common stock equivalents resulting from potentially dilutive securities approximated
381,000
and
1,410,000
at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and have not been included in the dilutive weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, as their effects are anti-dilutive. 9.     Contingencies and Guaranty Contingent Liability
In February 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with SDG&E to sell 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum throughout SDG&E’s California service territory, including San Diego and Imperial Counties and portions of Orange County (the “SDG&E Agreement”), for a total payment of $ 50.0
million. The SDG&E Agreement will support SDG&E’s deployment of a private LTE network for its California service territory, with a population of approximately
3.6
million people. Delivery of the relevant 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses by county to SDG&E commenced in fiscal year 2023 and is scheduled for completion before the end of fiscal year 2024. The total payment of $ 50.0
million is comprised of an initial payment of $ 20.0
million received in February 2021 and the remaining $ 30.0
million payment, which is due through fiscal year 2024 as the Company delivers the relevant cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses to SDG&E. During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company delivered to SDG&E 1.4 x 1.4 cleared Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband license related to Imperial County and received a milestone payment of $ 0.2  million. The SDG&E Agreement is subject to customary provisions regarding remedies, including reduced payment amounts and/or refund of amounts paid, and termination rights, if a party fails to perform its contractual obligations. A gain or loss on the sale of spectrum will be recognized for each county once the Company delivers the cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses to SDG&E in full. As the Company is required to refund payments it has received in the event of termination or non-delivery of the specific county’s 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum, it recorded the $ 20.2
million received from SDG&E as contingent liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded the $ 20.2
million payments from SDG&E as a short-term liability due to the expected timing of delivery.
Xcel Energy Guaranty In connection with Xcel Energy Agreement, the Company entered into a guaranty agreement, under which the Company guaranteed the delivery of the relevant 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses in Xcel Energy’s service territory in eight states along with other commercial obligations. In the event of default or non-delivery of the specific territory’s 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum, the Company is required to refund payments it has received. In addition, to the extent it has performed its obligations, the Company’s liability and obligations under the Xcel Energy Agreement will extend only to the remaining unperformed obligations. The Company has not recorded a liability for these guarantees as delivery of the relevant cleared 900 MHz Broadband licenses or counties is expected to commence in the first quarter of Fiscal 2024 through 2028. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum potential liability of future undiscounted payments under this agreement is approximately $ 8.0
million.
Litigation
From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation that arises from the ordinary operations of the business, such as contractual or employment disputes or other general actions. The Company is not involved in any material legal proceedings at this time.
COVID-19 Pandemic and Macroeconomic Conditions In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic and COVID-19 continues to cause significant disruptions throughout the world. The ultimate extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the future financial performance of the Company will depend on ongoing developments, all of which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted. The Company continues to closely monitor the risks posed by COVID-19 and adjusts its practices accordingly. Additionally, although difficult to quantify, the Company believes that the current macroeconomic environment, including inflation, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s target customers’ businesses, which may harm the Company’s commercialization efforts and negatively impact the Company’s revenues. If the Company is not able to control its higher operating costs or if the Company’s
18 Table of Contents commercialization efforts are slowed or negatively impacted, continued periods of high inflation could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition. In December 2020, the Company deferred payroll taxes under the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The deferral amounted to approximately $ 0.3
million, which has assisted the Company in managing the financial impact caused by the pandemic. Of the total deferred, approximately $ 0.2
million was remitted to the IRS during Fiscal 2022, with the remaining amount remitted during the three months ended December 31, 2022. 10.     Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The cash balance at times may exceed federally insured limits, however, the Company places its cash and temporary cash investments with financial institutions for which credit loss is not anticipated. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s operating revenue was entirely from upfront, fully paid fees received from Motorola, Ameren and Evergy, as discussed in Note 2
Revenue .
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company does
not
have an outstanding accounts receivable balance.

Overview We are a wireless communications company focused on commercializing our spectrum assets to enable our targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers to deploy private broadband networks and on offering innovative broadband technologies and solutions to the same target customers. We are the largest holder of licensed spectrum in the 900 MHz band (896 - 901 / 935 - 940 MHz) with nationwide coverage throughout the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico. On May 13, 2020, the FCC approved the Report and Order to modernize and realign the 900 MHz band to increase its usability and capacity by allowing it to be utilized for the deployment of broadband networks, technologies and solutions. The Report and Order was published in the Federal Register on July 16, 2020 and became effective on August 17, 2020. We are now engaged in qualifying for and securing broadband licenses from the FCC. At the same time, we are pursuing opportunities to lease the broadband spectrum we secure to our targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers.
We were originally incorporated in California in 1997 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2014. In November 2015, we changed our name from Pacific DataVision, Inc. to pdvWireless, Inc. In August 2019, we changed our name from pdvWireless, Inc. to Anterix Inc. We maintain offices in Woodland Park, New Jersey, McLean, Virginia and Abilene, Texas. Refer to our 2022 Annual Report for a more complete description of the nature of our business, including details regarding the process and costs to secure our broadband licenses. Business Developments On October 28, 2022, we entered into an agreement with Xcel Energy providing Xcel Energy dedicated long-term usage of our 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum for a term of 20 years throughout Xcel Energy’s service territory in eight states (the “Xcel Energy Agreement”). The Xcel Energy Agreement also provides Xcel Energy an option to extend the agreement for two 10-year terms for additional payments. The Xcel Energy Agreement allows Xcel Energy to deploy a private LTE network to support its grid modernization initiatives for the benefit of its approximately 3.7 million electricity customers and 2.1 million natural gas customers. The scheduled prepayments for the 20-year initial term of the Xcel Energy Agreement total $80.0 million, of which $8.0 million was received in December 2022. In September 2021, we entered into a long-term lease agreement of 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum with Evergy (the “Evergy Agreement”). The Evergy service territories covered by the Evergy Agreement are in Kansas and Missouri with a population of approximately 3.9 million people. The Evergy Agreement is for a term of up to 40 years, comprised of an initial term of 20 years and two 10-year renewal options for additional payments. We received full prepayment of $30.2 million for the initial 20-year term in October 2021. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we leased to Evergy the first deliverable of 1.4 x 1.4 cleared Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses for 70 counties. The revenue recognized for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. In February 2021, we entered into an agreement with SDG&E, to provide 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum throughout SDG&E’s California service territory, including San Diego and Imperial Counties and portions of Orange County for a total payment of $50.0 million. The total payment of $50.0 million is comprised of an initial payment of $20.0 million received in February 2021 and the remaining $30.0 million payment, which is due through fiscal year 2024 as we deliver the associated broadband licenses to SDG&E and the relevant cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum. During the quarter
20 Table of Contents ended September 30, 2022, we delivered to SDG&E 1.4 x 1.4 cleared Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband license related to Imperial County and received a milestone payment of $0.2 million. In May 2022, we issued Motorola 500,000 shares of our common stock (the “Shares”). Motorola received the Shares by electing to convert 500,000 Class B Units (the “Units”) it held in our subsidiary, PDV Spectrum Holding Company, LLC (the “Subsidiary”). Motorola acquired the Units in September 2014 in connection with a Spectrum Lease Agreement between Motorola and the Subsidiary (the “2014 Motorola Spectrum Agreement”). Under the 2014 Motorola Spectrum Agreement, Motorola leased a portion of our narrowband spectrum, which was held by the Subsidiary, in consideration for an upfront, fully-paid leasing fee of $7.5 million and a $10.0 million investment in the Units. Motorola had the right at any time to convert its Units into the Shares, representing a conversion price of $20.00 per share. In June 2022, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 to register the 500,000 shares of our common stock held by Motorola for resale or other disposition by Motorola (the “Resale Registration Statement”). The Resale Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on July 15, 2022. Results of Operations

Direct cost of revenue decreased a modest amount for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses increased by $1.9 million, or 18%, to $12.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $10.2 million for three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase for the three months ended December 31, 2022 of $1.9 million, primarily resulted from $0.9 million higher stock compensation expense due to additional grants awarded during Fiscal 2023, $0.5 million higher headcount and related costs, $0.2 million higher regulatory fees, $0.1 million higher professional service costs, $0.1 million in higher recruiting costs, and $0.1 million higher travel and meeting costs. General and administrative expenses increased by $5.1 million, or 17%, to $34.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 from $29.8 million for nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increase for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 of $5.1 million, primarily resulted from $3.4 million higher stock compensation expense due to additional grants awarded during Fiscal 2023, $1.2 million higher headcount and related costs, $0.3 million higher travel and meeting costs, $0.2 million higher regulatory fees, $0.1 million higher recruiting cost and $0.1 million higher IT related costs, partially offset by $0.2 million lower site related costs.
Sales and support expenses Sales and support expenses increased by $0.1 million, or 10%, to $1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $1.3 million for three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase for the three months ended December 31, 2022 of $0.1 million, primarily resulted from higher headcount and related costs. Sales and support expenses increased by $0.5 million, or 14%, to $3.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 from $3.3 million for nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increase for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 of $0.5 million, primarily resulted from a $0.3 million higher headcount and related costs, $0.2 million higher travel and meeting costs and $0.1 million higher marketing costs, partially offset by $0.1 million lower contract consulting costs. Product development expenses Product development expenses increased by $43 thousand, or 5%, to $0.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $0.9 million for three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the three months ended December 31, 2022 of $43 thousand, primarily resulted from higher professional service costs and stock compensation expense. Product development expenses increased by $0.2 million, or 7%, to $3.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 from $2.8 million for nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 of $0.2 million, primarily resulted from $0.4 million higher IT related cost and $0.2 million higher consulting costs offset by $0.5 million lower headcount and related costs. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization increased by $50 thousand, or 15%, to $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $0.3 million for three months ended December 31, 2021. Depreciation and amortization increased by $0.1 million, or 11%, to $1.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 from $1.0 million for nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increase for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 of $50 thousand and $0.1 million, respectively, was primarily as a result of assets placed in service during the periods.

As a result, we recorded a $5.8 million non-monetary gain from disposal of the intangible assets in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we exchanged our narrowband licenses for broadband licenses in 70 counties. In connection with the exchange, we recorded an estimated accounting cost basis of $13.1 million for the new broadband licenses and disposed of $3.8 million related to the value ascribed to the narrowband licenses we relinquished to the FCC for those same 70 counties. As a result, we recorded a $9.3 million non-monetary gain from disposal of the intangible assets in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2022.

For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a total deferred tax expense of $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively, due to the inability to use some portion of our federal and state NOL carryforwards against the deferred tax liability created by amortization of indefinite-lived intangibles. Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents generated from customer contract proceeds. At December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $57.5 million.
We believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, along with contracted proceeds from customers will be sufficient to meet our financial obligations through at least 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report. As noted above, our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the costs and timing of our spectrum retuning activities, spectrum acquisitions and the Anti-Windfall Payments to the U.S. Treasury, our operating activities, any cash proceeds we generate through our commercialization activities and our ability to timely deliver broadband licenses to our customers in accordance with our contractual obligations. We will deploy capital at our determined pace based on several key ongoing factors, including customer demand, market opportunity, and offsetting income from spectrum leases. As we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic or the current negative macroeconomic environment, including the adverse effect of inflation, or their respective impacts on our Company or our targeted customers, we cannot reasonably estimate their respective potential negative financial impact to our results of operations, commercialization efforts and financial condition. We are actively managing our business to maintain our cash flow and believe that we currently have adequate liquidity. To implement our business plans and initiatives, however, we may need to raise additional capital. We cannot predict with certainty the exact amount or timing for any future capital raises. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report for a reference to the risks and uncertainties that could cause our costs to be more than we currently anticipate and/or our revenue and operating results to be lower than we currently anticipate. If required, we intend to raise additional capital through debt or equity financings, including pursuant to our Shelf Registration Statement (as defined below) or through some other financing arrangement. However, we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available if and when needed, or that, if available, we can obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders and to us. Any failure to obtain financing when required will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity. In April 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf Registration Statement”) on Form S-3 with the SEC that was declared effective by the SEC on April 20, 2020, which permits us to offer up to $150.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, warrants or units in one or more offerings and in any combination, including in units from time to time. Our Shelf Registration Statement is intended to provide us with additional flexibility to access capital markets for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of debt, other corporate expenses and acquisitions of complementary products, technologies, or businesses. We entered into an Amended and Restated Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement and an Amended and Restated Sales Agreement (collectively, the “Sales Agreements”) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and B. Riley FBR, Inc., respectively (collectively, the “Agents”). On April 3, 2020, we registered the sale of up to an aggregate of $50.0 million, in shares of our common stock in at the market sales transactions pursuant to the Sales Agreements under the Shelf Registration Statement. Through the date of this filing, we have not sold any shares of our common stock in at the market transactions or any securities under the Shelf Registration Statement. 24 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities Nine months ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (18,676) $ 27,037  Net cash used in investing activities $ (20,612) $ (16,282) Net cash used in financing activities $ (8,825) $ (529) Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities.
Net cash used in operating activities was $18.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $27.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The majority of net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, resulted from a net loss of $31.9 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $6.7 million and non-cash adjustments to net loss of $5.8 million (primarily attributable to stock compensation expense of $13.4 million, partially offset by the gain on disposals of intangible assets of $9.3 million). The majority of net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2021, resulted from an increase in deferred revenue of $52.0 million and non-cash adjustments to net loss of $1.6 million (primarily attributable to stock compensation expense of $10.0 million, partially offset by the gain on disposal of intangible assets of $10.2 million), partially offset by a net loss of $26.5 million. The increase in deferred revenue is mainly due to cash receipts of $8.0 million and $52.8 million in proceeds from our 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum customer prepayments during Fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities . Net cash used in investing activities was $20.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $16.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily to acquire, swap or retune wireless licenses in markets across the United States. Net cash used in financing activities . Net cash used in financing activities was $8.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $0.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in financing activities was primarily from the repurchase of common stock of $8.2 million and payments of withholding tax on net issuance of restricted stock of $1.5 million, partially offset by the proceeds from stock option exercises of $0.9 million. For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in financing activities was primarily from the repurchase of common stock of $12.0 million and payments of withholding tax on net issuance of restricted stock of $1.5 million, partially offset by the proceeds from stock option exercises of $12.9 million. Material Cash Requirements Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the timeline and costs to acquire broadband licenses pursuant to the Report and Order, including the costs to acquire additional spectrum, the costs related to retuning, or swapping spectrum held by 900 MHz site-based licensees in the broadband segment that is required under section 90.621(b) to be protected by a broadband licensee with a base station at any location within the county, or any 900 MHz geographic-based SMR licensee in the broadband segment whose license area completely or partially overlaps the county, and the costs of paying Anti-Windfall Payments to the U.S. Treasury; costs related to the commercializing of our spectrum assets; and our ability to sign customer contracts and generate revenues from the license or transfer of any broadband licenses we secure; and our ability to timely deliver broadband licenses to our customers in accordance with our contractual obligation. Xcel Energy Guaranty In connection with Xcel Energy Agreement, we entered into a guaranty agreement, under which we guaranteed the delivery of the relevant 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses in Xcel Energy’s service territory in eight states along with other commercial obligations. In the event of default or non-delivery of the specific territory’s 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum, we are required to refund payments we have received. In addition, to the extent it has performed its obligations, our liability and obligations under the Xcel Energy Agreement will extend only to the remaining unperformed obligations. We have not recorded a liability for these guarantees as delivery of the relevant cleared 900 MHz Broadband licenses or counties is expected to commence in the first quarter of Fiscal 2024 through 2028. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum potential liability of future undiscounted payments under this agreement is approximately $8.0 million.
25 Table of Contents Share Repurchase Program In September 2021, our Board authorized a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock on or before September 29, 2023. The manner, timing and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us based on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions and alternative investment opportunities. The share repurchase program authorization does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We currently anticipate the cash used for the share repurchase program will come primarily from our prepaid customer agreements. The following table presents the share repurchase activity for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except per share data):
Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Number of shares repurchased and retired 106  200  216  200  Average price paid per share* $ 33.11  $ 60.02  $ 47.05  $ 60.02  Total cost to repurchase $ 3,498  $ 11,993  $ 8,223  $ 11,993  * Average price paid per share includes costs associated with the repurchases. As of December 31, 2022, $26.8 million is remaining under the share repurchase program. Off-balance sheet arrangements
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, we did not have and do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk Our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and accounts payable. We consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. However, because of the short-term nature of the highly liquid instruments in our portfolio, a 10% change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and/or results of operations.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations Our operations are based in the United States and, accordingly, all of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. We are currently not exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency.
Inflation Risk Inflationary factors may adversely affect our operating results. As a result of recent increases in inflation, certain of our operating expenses have increased. Additionally, although difficult to quantify, we believe that the current macroeconomic environment, including inflation, may have an adverse effect on our target customers’ businesses, which may harm our commercialization efforts and negatively impact our revenues. If we are not able to control our higher operating costs or if our commercialization efforts are slowed or negatively impacted, continued periods of high inflation could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We continue to monitor our market risk exposure, including any adverse impacts related to COVID-19 pandemic or the current macroeconomic environment, which has resulted in significant market volatility.
26 Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of such period. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d), our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that no changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
