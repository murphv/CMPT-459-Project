AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) (1) NATURE OF OPERATIONS Steel Connect, Inc. (the "Company" or the "Parent"), is a holding company which operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary ModusLink Corporation ("ModusLink" or "Supply Chain"). ModusLink is a supply chain business process management company serving clients in markets such as consumer electronics, communications, computing, medical devices, software and retail. ModusLink designs and executes elements in its clients' global supply chains to improve speed to market, product customization, flexibility, cost, quality and service. ModusLink also produces and licenses an entitlement management solution for activation, provisioning, entitlement subscription and data collection from physical goods (connected products) and digital products. Disposition of IWCO Direct
On February 25, 2022 (the "Disposal Date"), the Company entered into a transaction agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) with (a) IWCO Direct Holding Inc. (''IWCO Direct" or "Direct Marketing") and its indirect subsidiaries, (b) Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, in its capacities as collateral agent and administrative agent under a financing agreement (in such capacities, the “Agent”), dated as of December 15, 2017, between IWCO Direct, IWCO Direct’s direct and indirect subsidiaries, the Agent and the lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”) (the “Financing Agreement”), (c) the Lenders, (d) the Lenders or their respective designees listed on the signature pages to the Transaction Agreement under the caption “Participating Lender Purchasers” (the “Participating Lender Purchasers”), (e) SPH Group Holdings LLC (the “Sponsor”) and (f) Instant Web Holdings, LLC (the “Buyer”), an entity owned by the Participating Lender Purchasers. On the Effective Date (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) and pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Company transferred all of its interests in IWCO Direct to the Buyer as part of a negotiated restructuring of the capital structure and certain financial obligations of IWCO Direct under the Financing Agreement as contemplated by the Transaction Agreement. The results of operations of the IWCO Direct business are reported as discontinued operations for the prior year period presented. See Note 4 - "Discontinued Operations" for additional information. All references made to financial data in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are to the Company's continuing operations, unless otherwise specifically noted. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, the Parent financed its operations and met its capital requirements primarily through funds generated from operations, the sale of its securities, borrowings from lending institutions and sales of facilities that were not fully utilized. The Parent believes it has access to adequate resources to meet its needs for normal operating costs, capital expenditures, debt obligations and working capital for at least the next twelve months. Upon a redemption request by the holder of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (as discussed in Note 16 - "Related Party Transactions" and in the Company's Fiscal Year 2022 Form 10-K filed), the Parent believes it is probable that it has access to adequate resources, including cash on hand and potential dividends from ModusLink, to pay the redemption price and continue its operations. As of January 31, 2023, these resources include cash and cash equivalents and ModusLink's credit agreement with Umpqua Bank (the “Umpqua Revolver”), as lender and as agent. The Umpqua Revolver provides for a maximum credit commitment of $ 12.5  million and a sublimit of $ 5.0  million for letters of credit and expires on March 16, 2024. There was no balance outstanding on the Umpqua Revolver as of January 31, 2023. See Note 9 - "Debt" for further details regarding the Umpqua Revolver. ModusLink believes that if dividends to the Parent are required, it would have access to adequate resources to meet its operating needs while remaining in compliance with the Umpqua Revolver's covenants over the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurances that ModusLink will continue to have access to its line of credit under the Umpqua Revolver if its financial performance does not satisfy the financial covenants set forth in its financing agreement, which could also result in the acceleration of its debt obligations by its lender, adversely affecting liquidity. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $ 62.4
million and $ 53.1
million, respectively. As of January 31, 2023, the Company had excess working capital of $ 32.6
million. COVID-19 Update 11 Table of Contents The COVID-19 pandemic (in particular, the emergence of new variants of the virus across the globe) has caused, and may continue to cause, significant disruptions in the U.S. and global economies. Measures taken by national and local governments in the United States and around the world restricted, and in certain jurisdictions continue to restrict, individuals’ daily activities and curtail or cease many businesses’ normal operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may further adversely impact, nearly all aspects of our business and markets, including our workforce and the operations of our clients, suppliers, and business partners. We experienced disruptions to our business continuity as a result of temporary closures of certain of ModusLink’s facilities in 2020 and 2021; however, these temporary closures did not have a significant impact on ModusLink’s operations. Outbreaks in Mainland China throughout 2022 (March to May, July and September to October) led to temporary lockdown orders impacting several ModusLink facilities in China; however, ModusLink was able to resume operations at all facilities and the lockdowns have not had a significant impact to ModusLink’s operations through the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If the situation continues at this level or worsens, however, it could result in a potential adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks on all aspects of our business and geographies, including its impact on our clients, employees, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. We believe that such impacts could include the continued disruption to the demand for our businesses' products and services; disruptions in or closures of our business operations or those of our customers or suppliers; the impact of the global business and economic environment on liquidity and the availability of capital; increased costs and delays in payments of outstanding receivables beyond normal payment terms; supply chain disruptions; uncertain demand; and the effect of any initiatives or programs that we may undertake to address financial and operational challenges faced by our customers. Despite indications of economic recovery, the severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business in the future is difficult to predict and will depend on a number of uncertain factors and trends. Such factors and trends include, but are not limited to: the emergence of new variant strains; the widespread use of vaccines; the impact of the global business and economic environment on liquidity and the availability of capital; the extent and severity of the impact on our customers and suppliers; and U.S. and foreign government actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, to mitigate adverse economic or other impacts or to mitigate the spread of the virus and its variants. The Company continues to monitor for any developments or updates to COVID-19 guidelines from public health and governmental authorities, as well as the protection of the health and safety of its personnel, and is continuously working to ensure that its health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols are in place to help mitigate any negative impacts of COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks on the Company’s employees, business or operations. Terminated Merger with Steel Holdings On June 12, 2022, the Company, Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (“Steel Holdings”) and SP Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Steel Holdings (“Merger Sub”), entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub would merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Steel Holdings. The Merger Agreement provided that each share of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than dissenting shares and shares owned by the Company, Steel Holdings or any of their respective subsidiaries) would, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, be converted into the right to receive (i) $ 1.35
in cash, without interest and (ii) one contingent value right to receive a pro rata share of the proceeds received by the Company, Steel Holdings or any of their affiliates with respect to the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of the assets currently owned by ModusLink within
two years
of the Merger’s closing date, to the extent such proceeds exceed $ 80.0  million plus certain related costs and expenses.
Steel Holdings and certain of its affiliates also entered into a Voting and Support Agreement, dated as of June 12, 2022 (the “Voting and Support Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, they agreed to vote all shares of common stock and Series C Convertible Preferred Stock beneficially owned by them in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Merger and any alternative acquisition agreement approved by the Company's Board of Directors (acting on the recommendation of the special committee (the “Special Committee”) of independent and disinterested directors formed to consider and negotiate the terms and conditions of the Merger and to make a recommendation to our Board of Directors). Our Board of Directors, acting on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, and the Board of Directors of Steel Partner Holdings GP Inc., the general partner of Steel Holdings, approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (such transactions, collectively, the “Transactions”) and resolved to recommend the stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Transactions. The Special Committee, which is comprised solely of independent and disinterested directors of the Company who are unaffiliated with Steel Holdings, exclusively negotiated the terms of the Merger Agreement with Steel Holdings, with the assistance of its independent financial and legal advisors. 12 Table of Contents On November 15, 2022, Steel Holdings terminated the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement was terminated following the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement was (a) approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of (i) a majority of the outstanding shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.01
per share, of the Company and (ii) a majority in voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock and Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (voting on an as converted to shares of common stock basis), voting together as a single class, but (b) not approved by a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock not owned, directly or indirectly, by Steel Holdings, and Merger Sub, any other officer or director of the Company or any other person having any equity interest in, or any right to acquire any equity interest in, Merger Sub or any person of which Merger Sub is a direct or indirect subsidiary as required under the Merger Agreement. As a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Voting and Support Agreement, dated as of June 12, 2022, by and among the Company, Steel Holdings and certain of its affiliates, automatically terminated pursuant to its terms. (2) BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of a normal recurring nature) considered necessary for fair presentation have been included. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended July 31, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2022), which are contained in the Company's Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year 2022. The results for the six months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of financial statements to provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. For the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through the date these financial statements were filed. Please refer to Note 18 - "Subsequent Events" for further details. Reclassification On the statement of cash flows for the six months ended January 31, 2022, the Company reclassified bad debt recovery as a non-cash adjustment to net loss which totaled $ 3.0
thousand from Accounts receivable, net to Bad debt recovery. This reclassification was made to prior year balances to conform with current reporting and had no impact on net loss or stockholder's deficit. (3) RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13,
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Loses on Financial Instruments , an ASU that requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial instruments, including trade receivables, based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The ASU will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2024 on a modified retrospective basis, which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06,
Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) . The amendment in this update simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models available for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. This update also amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions and requires the application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share. The update also requires entities to provide expanded disclosures about the terms and features of convertible instruments, how the instruments have been reported in the entity's financial statements and information about events, conditions and circumstances that can affect the assessment of the amount or timing of an entity's future
13 Table of Contents cash flows related to those instruments. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning in our fiscal year ending July 31, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements. In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10,
Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance.
The ASU requires annual disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. This guidance is effective for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements. Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after January 31, 2023 are not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity . 14 Table of Contents (4) DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS As discussed in Note 1 - "Nature of Operations", on February 25, 2022, the Company completed the disposition of IWCO Direct. The Company received
no
cash consideration for the disposition (the entire transaction being referred to as the “IWCO Direct Disposal”). As of the Disposal Date and subject to the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement, the parties entered into certain mutual releases as fully set forth in the Transaction Agreement. In addition, as part of the overall transaction, the Buyer issued a note in the principal amount of $ 6.9  million payable to the Company as consideration for intercompany obligations owed by IWCO Direct to the Company (the “Subordinated Note”). The Subordinated Note is subordinated to the obligations under the Financing Agreement (including any amendments or other modifications thereto) and matures on the date that is the earlier of (a) the later of (i) August 25, 2027 and (ii) the date that is six months after the maturity of the Financing Agreement, or (b) the date that is six months after repayment in full of the obligations under the Financing Agreement. Due to the subordinated nature of the Subordinated Note and the assessment of collectability, the Company determined the fair value of the Subordinated Note was
zero . The Company deconsolidated IWCO Direct as of the Disposal Date as the Company no longer held a controlling financial interest in IWCO Direct as of that date. The Company did not have any amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with IWCO Direct at the time of deconsolidation. The disposal of IWCO Direct represents a strategic shift to exit the direct marketing business and its results are reported as discontinued operations for the prior year periods presented. A summary of the results of the discontinued operations is as follows: Three months ended January 31, Six months ended January 31, 2022 2022 Net revenue $ 66,316   $ 147,375   Cost of revenue 63,617 138,802 Gross profit 2,699 8,573 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 12,523 25,355 Amortization of intangible assets 3,903 8,085 Restructuring 535 873 Total operating expenses 16,961 34,313 Operating loss ( 14,262 ) ( 25,740 ) Other expense: Interest expense ( 7,229 ) ( 14,262 ) Total other expense, net ( 7,229 ) ( 14,262 ) Loss from discontinued operations before income taxes ( 21,491 ) ( 40,002 ) Income tax expense — — Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ ( 21,491 ) $ ( 40,002 ) 15 Table of Contents (5) INVENTORIES, NET The table below presents the components of Inventories, net:

million. As previously reported by the Company, several principal adjustments were made to its historic financial statements for periods ended on or before January 31, 2012, the most significant of which related to the treatment of vendor rebates in its pricing policies. Where the retention of a rebate or a mark-up was determined to have been inconsistent with a client contract, the Company concluded that these amounts were not properly recorded as revenue. Accordingly, revenue was reduced by an equivalent amount for the period that the rebate was estimated to have been affected. A corresponding liability for the same amount was recorded in that period (referred to as accrued pricing liabilities). The Company believes that it may not ultimately be required to pay all or any of the accrued pricing liabilities based upon the expiration of statutes of limitations, and due in part to the nature of the interactions with its clients. The remaining accrued pricing liabilities as of January 31, 2023 will be derecognized when there is sufficient information for the Company to conclude that such liabilities are not subject to escheatment and have been extinguished, which may occur through payment, legal release, or other legal or factual determination. The Company has not provided for any provision for interest and or penalties related to escheatment as it has concluded that such is not probable to occur, and any potential interest and penalties cannot be reasonably estimated. 16 Table of Contents (7)
RESTRUCTURING ModusLink Restructuring Activities During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, ModusLink implemented a strategic plan to reorganize its sales function and the e-Business operations. The restructuring charges associated with this plan were primarily composed of employee termination costs. In November 2021, ModusLink amended its strategic plan to include reorganizing its supply chain operations and recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $ 0.9  million during the three months ended January 31, 2022. In July 2022, ModusLink reorganized its supply chain operations in Ireland and recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $ 0.6  million during the three months ended July 31, 2022, which reduced the restructuring liability at January 31, 2023. The restructuring charges recorded in fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 were primarily composed of employee termination costs.

thousand and $ 79  thousand as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively, which are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets. 7.50 % Convertible Senior Note On February 28, 2019, the Company entered into a
7.50 % Convertible Senior Note Due 2024 Purchase Agreement (the "SPHG Note Purchase Agreement") with SPH Group Holdings LLC ("SPHG Holdings"), whereby SPHG Holdings agreed to loan the Company $ 14.9
million in exchange for a
7.50 % Convertible Senior Note due 2024 (the "SPHG Note"). SPHG Holdings has the right, at its option, prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2024, the maturity date of the SPHG Note, to convert the SPHG Note or a portion thereof that is $ 1,000
or an integral multiple thereof, into shares of common stock (if the Company has not received a required stockholder approval) or cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, as applicable (if the Company has received a required stockholder approval), at an initial conversion rate of 421.2655 shares of common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 2.37
per share (subject to adjustment as provided in the SPHG Note) per $ 1,000
principal amount of the SPHG Note, subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the SPHG Note. As of January 31, 2023, the if-converted value of the SPHG Note did not exceed the principal value of the SPHG Note. As of January 31, 2023, the remaining period over which the unamortized discount will be amortized is
13
months. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the net carrying value of the SPHG Note was $ 12.1
million and $ 11.0
million, respectively. The effective interest rate on the SPHG Note, including accretion of the discount, is
27.8 %.

Umpqua Revolver On March 16, 2022, ModusLink, as borrower, entered into a new credit agreement with Umpqua Bank as lender and as agent. The Umpqua Revolver provides for a maximum credit commitment of $ 12.5  million and a sublimit of $ 5.0  million for letters of credit and expires on March 16, 2024. Concurrent with signing the Umpqua Revolver ModusLink submitted a notice of termination to MidCap Financial Trust for its $ 12.5  million revolving credit facility (the “MidCap Credit Facility”), which was set to expire on December 31, 2022.
There was no balance outstanding on the Midcap Credit Facility at the time of its termination. As of January 31, 2023, ModusLink was in compliance with the Umpqua Revolver's covenants, and believes it will remain in compliance with the Umpqua Revolver’s covenants for the next twelve months. As of January 31, 2023, ModusLink had available borrowing capacity of $ 11.9
million and there was $ 0.6
million available for letters of credit. See Note 18 – “Subsequent Events” for additional information regarding the Umpqua Revolver. (10) CONTINGENCIES Legal Proceedings On April 13, 2018, a purported shareholder, Donald Reith, filed a verified complaint, Reith v. Lichtenstein, et al., 2018-277 (Del. Ch.) in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaint alleges class and derivative claims for breach of fiduciary duty and/or aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment against the Board of Directors, Warren G. Lichtenstein, Glen M. Kassan, William T. Fejes, Jack L. Howard, Jeffrey J. Fenton, Philip E. Lengyel and Jeffrey S. Wald; and stockholders Steel Holdings, Steel Partners, Ltd., SPHG Holdings, Handy & Harman Ltd. and WHX CS Corp. (collectively, the "Steel Parties") in connection with the acquisition of $ 35.0
million of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock by SPHG Holdings and equity grants made to Messrs. Lichtenstein, Howard and Fejes on December 15, 2017 (collectively, the "Challenged Transactions"). The Company is named as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges that although the Challenged Transactions were approved by a Special Committee consisting of the independent members of the Board of Directors (Messrs. Fenton, Lengyel and Wald), the Steel Parties dominated and controlled the Special Committee, who approved the Challenged Transactions in breach of their fiduciary duty. Plaintiff alleges that the Challenged Transactions unfairly diluted stockholders and therefore unjustly enriched Steel Holdings, SPHG Holdings and Messrs. Lichtenstein, Howard and Fejes. The complaint also alleges that the Board of Directors made misleading disclosures in the Company's proxy statement for the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in connection with seeking approval to amend the 2010 Incentive Award Plan to authorize the issuance of additional shares to accommodate certain shares underlying the equity grants. Remedies requested include rescission of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and equity grants, disgorgement of any unjustly obtained property or compensation and monetary damages. On June 8, 2018, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to plead demand futility and failure to state a claim. On June 28, 2019, the Court denied most of the motion to dismiss allowing the matter to proceed. The defendants answered the complaint on September 6, 2019, denying all liability.
On August 13, 2021, the Company, together with certain of its current and former directors of the Board, Warren Lichtenstein, Glen Kassan, William Fejes, Jr., Jack Howard, Jeffrey Fenton and Jeffrey Wald, as well as other named defendants (collectively, the “Defendants”), entered into a memorandum of understanding (the “MOU”) with Donald Reith (the “Plaintiff”) in connection with the settlement of the Reith v. Lichtenstein, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0277-MTZ (Del. Ch. 2018) class and derivative action. A definitive Stipulation of Settlement (the “Stipulation”) incorporating the terms of the MOU was filed with the Court on February 18, 2022. Pursuant to the MOU and Stipulation, and contingent on approval of the terms by the court, the Defendants agreed to cause their directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carriers to pay to the Company $ 2.75  million in cash.
Additionally, under the MOU and separate letter agreements between the Company and such individuals (the “Surrender Agreements”), Messrs. Lichtenstein, Howard and Fejes agreed to surrender to the Company an aggregate
3.3  million shares that they had initially received in December 2017 in consideration for services to the Company. The surrenders and cancellations are in the following amounts: for Mr. Lichtenstein,
1,833,333
vested shares and
300,000
unvested shares; for Mr. Howard,
916,667
19 Table of Contents vested shares and
150,000
unvested shares; and for Mr. Fejes,
100,000
vested shares. On August 17, 2021, Mr. Lichtenstein and Mr. Howard surrendered the shares required under the MOU, the Stipulation and their respective Surrender Agreements, and in December 2021 Mr. Fejes did the same. All such shares were subsequently cancelled. Pursuant to the MOU and Stipulation, the Company also agreed to pay the Plaintiff’s counsel legal fees for this matter in an amount up to $ 2.05  million, if approved by the court. After the parties filed papers in support of court approval of the settlement, and an objector filed papers in opposition to approval of the settlement, and after hearings held on August 12 and August 18, 2022, the parties submitted an amendment to the Stipulation: (i) increasing the proposed total contribution of the insurers to $ 3.0  million, (ii) reducing Plaintiff’s counsel’s fee request to $ 1.6  million, and (iii) providing that if the then pending proposed Merger was consummated, the $ 3  million, minus fees awarded to Plaintiff’s counsel and costs of distribution of up to $ 125,000 , would be distributed to the holders of eligible shares of Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement governing the Merger), other than the Defendants; provided, however, that no distribution would be required to be made to any holder whose proportionate share of the distribution would be less than $ 1.00 . On September 23, 2022, the court ruled that it was denying approval of the settlement.
At the court’s instruction, the parties provided a status report on October 24, 2022, reporting that the vote on the proposed Merger had been postponed to October 28, 2022, and proposing to file a revised status report on November 23, 2022. The parties filed the status report on November 23, 2022, reporting that due to the termination of the proposed Merger on November 15, 2022, the parties were conferring on the next steps, and therefore proposed providing another status report within 30 days, or on other such date as the court may order. On November 28, 2022, the court issued a minute order advising that no further status updates were required to be filed in the matter and noting that the court would remain available to hear requests for relief as needed. No trial date or pretrial deadlines are currently scheduled. The possible recovery, if any, with respect to this dispute cannot be determined as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. (11) REVENUE RECOGNITION Disaggregation of Revenue The following table presents the Company's revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated by major good or service line and timing of revenue recognition. The table also includes a reconciliation of the disaggregated revenue with the reportable segments. Three months ended January 31, Six months ended January 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (In thousands) Major Goods/Service Lines Supply chain management services $ 50,427   $ 53,719   101,358   97,661   Other 354   603   782   1,015   $ 50,781   $ 54,322   $ 102,140   $ 98,676   Timing of Revenue Recognition Services transferred over time $ 50,781   $ 54,322   102,140   98,676   $ 50,781   $ 54,322   $ 102,140   $ 98,676   Supply Chain Management Services ModusLink's revenue primarily comes from the sale of supply chain management services to its clients. Amounts billed to customers under these arrangements include revenue attributable to the services performed as well as for materials procured on the customer's behalf as part of its service to them. The majority of these arrangements consist of two distinct performance obligations (i.e., warehousing/inventory management service and a separate kitting/packaging/assembly service), revenue related to each of which is recognized over time as services are performed using an input method based on the level of efforts expended. Other Other revenue consists of cloud-based software subscriptions, software maintenance and support service contracts, and fees for professional services. Revenue related to these arrangements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement or over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs incurred in satisfying the obligations under the contract. 20 Table of Contents Contract Balances Timing of revenue recognition may differ from timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records contract assets and liabilities related to its contracts with customers as follows: • Accounts receivable when revenue is recognized prior to receipt of cash payments and if the right to such amounts is unconditional and solely based on the passage of time. • Contract asset when the Company recognizes revenue based on efforts expended but the right to such amount is conditional upon satisfaction of another performance obligation. The Company's contract assets are all short-term in nature and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. • Deferred revenue when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance. Deferred revenue is primarily comprised of fees related to supply chain management services, cloud-based software subscriptions and software maintenance and support service contracts, which are generally billed in advance. Deferred revenue also includes other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. The deferred revenue balance is classified as a component of other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. The table below presents information for the Company's contract balances: January 31, 2023 July 31, 2022 (In thousands) Accounts receivable, trade, net $ 37,180   $ 40,083   Contract assets 508   369   Deferred revenue - current $ 3,489   $ 2,705   Deferred revenue - long-term 88   134   Total deferred revenue $ 3,577   $ 2,839   Remaining Performance Obligations Remaining performance obligations are comprised of deferred revenue. Changes in deferred revenue during the six months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, were as follows: Six Months Ended January 31, 2023 2022 (In thousands) Balance at beginning of period $ 2,839   $ 2,320   Deferral of revenue 1,483   1,656   Recognition of deferred amounts upon satisfaction of performance obligation ( 745 ) ( 588 ) Balance at end of period $ 3,577   $ 3,388   The Company expects to recognize approximately $ 3.5
million of the deferred revenue over the next
twelve months
and the remaining $ 0.1
million beyond that time period. The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. (12) INCOME TAXES The Company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within and outside of the United States. For the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company was profitable in certain jurisdictions, resulting in an income tax expense using enacted rates in those jurisdictions. As of both January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the total amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to federal, state and foreign taxes was approximately $ 0.8
million. 21 Table of Contents On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was signed into law in the United States. Among other provisions, the IRA includes a 15.0% corporate minimum tax rate on the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations and a 1.0% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022 by U.S. publicly traded corporations and certain U.S. subsidiaries of non-U.S. publicly traded corporations, as well as significant enhancements of U.S. tax incentives relating to climate and energy investments. Although we do not expect the IRA to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, the full effect on us is uncertain. On March 27, 2020, the President of the United States signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act into law, which is intended to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy, public health, state and local governments, individuals and businesses. We do not expect the CARES Act to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Uncertain Tax Positions In accordance with the Company's accounting policy, interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is included in the income tax expense line of the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the liabilities for interest expense related to uncertain tax positions were $ 0.01
million and $ 0.1
million, respectively. The Company expects $ 0.2
million of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest to reverse in the next twelve months. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax and various state, local and international income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. The federal and state tax returns are generally subject to tax examinations for the tax years ended July 31, 2019 through July 31, 2022. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax year in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. In addition, a number of tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate government agencies for certain countries in the Europe and Asia regions. In Europe, the Company's 2014 through 2021 tax years remain subject to examination in most locations, while the Company's 2010 through 2021 tax years remain subject to examination in most Asia locations. 22 Table of Contents (13) EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE The following table reconciles net earnings (loss) per share for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022: Three Months Ended January 31, Six Months Ended January 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (In thousands, except per share data) Reconciliation of net (loss) income to net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders after assumed conversions: Net (loss) income from continuing operations $ ( 526 ) $ ( 1,486 ) $ 4,431   $ ( 2,469 ) Loss from discontinued operations —   ( 21,491 ) —   ( 40,002 ) Net (loss) income ( 526 ) ( 22,977 ) 4,431   ( 42,471 ) Less: Preferred dividends on redeemable preferred stock ( 537 ) ( 537 ) ( 1,074 ) ( 1,074 ) Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders $ ( 1,063 ) $ ( 23,514 ) $ 3,357   $ ( 43,545 ) Net (loss) income per common share - basic Net (loss) income from continuing operations $ ( 0.02 ) $ ( 0.03 ) $ 0.06   $ ( 0.06 ) Net loss from discontinued operations —   ( 0.36 ) —   ( 0.67 ) Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders $ ( 0.02 ) $ ( 0.39 ) $ 0.06   $ ( 0.73 ) Net (loss) income per common share - diluted Net (loss) income from continuing operations $ ( 0.02 ) $ ( 0.03 ) $ 0.06   $ ( 0.06 ) Net loss from discontinued operations —   ( 0.36 ) —   ( 0.67 ) Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders $ ( 0.02 ) $ ( 0.39 ) $ 0.06   $ ( 0.73 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic 60,178   59,748   60,129   60,027   Effect of dilutive securities: Common stock equivalents - Restricted stock and restricted stock shares —   —   508   —   Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 60,178   59,748   60,637   60,027   Basic net (loss) income per common share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net (loss) income per common share considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities except in periods in which there is a net loss because the inclusion of the potential common shares would have an anti-dilutive effect. Diluted net (loss) income per common share, if any, gives effect to diluted stock options (calculated based on the treasury stock method), non-vested restricted stock shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan and shares issuable upon debt or preferred stock conversion (calculated using an as-if converted method). For the three months ended January 31, 2023, $ 0.8
million of interest expense, net of tax related to convertible debt and $ 0.5
million of preferred dividends were excluded from the numerator in the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their inclusion would have been antidilutive. For the three months ended January 31, 2022, $ 0.7
million of interest expense, net of tax impact related to convertible debt and $ 0.5
million of preferred dividends were excluded from the numerator in the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their inclusion would have been antidilutive. For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022,
24.7
million common stock equivalent shares (including those related to convertible debt and preferred stock) were excluded from the denominator in the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their inclusion would have been antidilutive. For the six months ended January 31, 2023, $ 1.6
million of interest expense, net of tax related to convertible debt and $ 1.1
million of preferred dividends were excluded from the numerator in the calculation of diluted net income per share as their inclusion would have been antidilutive. For the six months ended January 31, 2022, $ 1.4

(14) COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) Comprehensive income (loss) combines net income (loss) and other comprehensive items. Other comprehensive items represent certain amounts that are reported as components of stockholders' equity in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Accumulated other comprehensive items consist of the following: Foreign Currency Items Pension Items Total (In thousands) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of July 31, 2022 $ 6,063   $ ( 1,923 ) $ 4,140   Foreign currency translation adjustment 1,818   —   1,818   Pension liability adjustments —   ( 1,078 ) ( 1,078 ) Net current-period other comprehensive income 1,818   ( 1,078 ) 740   Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of January 31, 2023 $ 7,881   $ ( 3,001 ) $ 4,880   Foreign Currency Items Pension Items Total (In thousands) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of July 31, 2021 $ 9,762   $ ( 2,600 ) $ 7,162   Foreign currency translation adjustment 185   —   185   Net current-period other comprehensive income 185   —   185   Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of January 31, 2022 $ 9,947   $ ( 2,600 ) $ 7,347   During the year ended July 31, 2020, a Netherlands defined benefit pension plan was amended such that active participants no longer accrued benefits as of January 1, 2020, which resulted in a pre-tax curtailment gain of $ 2.4  million recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At that time, the active plan participants were moved into a new defined benefit contribution pension plan. During the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Company recorded an increase of approximately $ 1.1  million to accrued pension liabilities for the defined benefit pension plan as it was determined that plan participants are entitled to unconditional indexation of benefits for as long as they remain in active service with the Company. (15) SEGMENT INFORMATION Subsequent to the Company’s disposition of the Direct Marketing reportable segment in the IWCO Direct Disposal, the Company has
one
reportable segment: Supply Chain. The Company also has Corporate-level activity, which consists primarily of costs associated with certain corporate administrative functions such as legal, finance and share-based compensation, which are not allocated to the Company's reportable segment. The Corporate-level balance sheet information includes cash and cash equivalents, debt and other assets and liabilities which are not allocated to the operations of the Company's operating segment. All significant intra-segment amounts have been eliminated. Management evaluates segment performance based on segment net revenue and operating income (loss). Management evaluates segment performance based on segment net revenue, operating income (loss) and "adjusted operating income (loss)," which is defined as the operating income (loss) excluding net charges related to depreciation, amortization of long-lived asset impairment, share-based compensation and restructuring. These items are excluded because they may be considered to be of a non-operational or non-cash nature. Historically, the Company has recorded significant impairment and restructuring charges, and therefore management uses adjusted operating income (loss) to assist in evaluating the performance of the Company's core operations. Summarized financial information of the Company's continuing operations by operating segment is as follows: 24 Table of Contents Three Months Ended January 31, Six Months Ended January 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (In thousands) Net revenue: Supply Chain $ 50,781   $ 54,322   102,140   98,676   Total segment net revenue 50,781   54,322   $ 102,140   $ 98,676   Operating income: Supply Chain 5,388   2,374   11,238   4,347   Total segment operating income 5,388   2,374   11,238   4,347   Corporate-level activity ( 2,785 ) ( 2,323 ) ( 4,756 ) ( 3,725 ) Total operating income 2,603   51   6,482   622   Total other expense, net ( 3,475 ) ( 814 ) ( 1,272 ) ( 2,053 ) (Loss) income before income taxes $ ( 872 ) $ ( 763 ) $ 5,210   $ ( 1,431 ) January 31, 2023 July 31, 2022 (In thousands) Total assets: Supply Chain $ 126,913   $ 101,637   Corporate 29,199   36,112   Total assets $ 156,112   $ 137,749   Summarized financial information of the Company's capital expenditures and depreciation expense for the Supply Chain reportable segment is as follows: Three Months Ended January 31, Six Months Ended January 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (In thousands) Capital expenditures $ 318   $ 463   $ 866   $ 826   Depreciation expense 465   545   924   1,175   Summarized financial information of the Company's net revenue by geographic location is as follows: Three Months Ended January 31, Six Months Ended January 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (In thousands) Mainland China $ 16,231   $ 19,424   $ 34,196   $ 35,390   United States 13,173   13,707   25,345   $ 24,153   Czech 7,535   3,990   13,295   6,757   Singapore 5,102 4,752 10,234 9,916 Netherlands 4,926   6,227   10,277   11,876   Other 3,814 6,222 8,793 10,584 $ 50,781   $ 54,322   $ 102,140   $ 98,676   (16) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS As of January 31, 2023, SPHG Holdings and its affiliates, including Steel Holdings, Handy & Harman Ltd. and Steel Partners Ltd., beneficially owned approximately

Fair Value Measurement , provides that fair value is an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. ASC 820 requires the Company to use valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized as follows: Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 26 Table of Contents Level 2: Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or market-corroborated inputs Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which require the Company to develop its own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets or liabilities The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable, current liabilities and the revolving line of credit under the Umpqua Revolver approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. We believe that the carrying value of our long-term debt approximates fair value because the stated interest rates of this debt is consistent with current market rates. The carrying value of capital lease obligations approximates fair value, as estimated by using discounted future cash flows based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following tables present the Company's financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, classified by fair value hierarchy: Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using (In thousands) January 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Money market funds $ 25,435   $ 25,435   $ —   $ —   Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using (In thousands) July 31, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Money market funds $ 31,756   $ 31,756   $ —   $ —   There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during any of the periods presented. When available, quoted prices are used to determine fair value. When quoted prices in active markets are available, investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair values are determined using pricing models, and the inputs to those pricing models are based on observable market inputs. The inputs to the pricing models are typically benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads and benchmark securities, among others. Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The Company reviews the carrying amounts of these assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset group or reporting unit is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The Company estimates the fair values of assets subject to impairment based on the Company's own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets and on observable market data, when available. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company's financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, customer deposits, accounts payable, restricted cash and debt, and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at carrying value. With the exception of the SPHG Note and long-term debt, carrying value approximates fair value for these items due to their short-term nature. The Company believes that the carrying value of the liability component of the SPHG Note and our long-term debt approximates fair value because the stated interest rates of this debt is consistent with current market rates. Included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets are money market funds. These are valued at quoted market prices in active markets. 27 Table of Contents (18)
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS SPHG Convertible Note Amendment On March 9, 2023, the Company and SPHG Holdings entered into an amendment to the SPHG Note (the “SPHG Note Amendment”). Pursuant to the SPHG Note Amendment, the maturity date of the SPHG Note was extended
six months
to September 1, 2024. In addition, the Company repaid $ 1.0  million in principal amount of the SPHG Note and will be required to repay an additional $ 1.0  million principal amount of the note on the
three
month anniversary of the SPHG Note Amendment. In connection with the SPHG Note Amendment, the Company paid SPHG Holdings a cash amendment fee of $ 0.1
million. Investment Sale The Company owns
9.8 % of a privately-held software company (the "Investee"), which was acquired in the early 2000s and whose book value was written down to zero in prior years. The Company was not required to account for this Investee as an equity method investment. On November 11, 2022, the Investee entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of its assets for $ 40.8  million (the "Purchase Price"). The sale was approved by shareholders on December 15, 2022 and closed in February 2023. The Company received the first distribution of approximately $ 1.9  million on March 10, 2023, which was communicated as
66.8 % of the total distribution to the Company. The Investee also communicated that the total distribution to the Company would be approximately $ 2.8  million, with the remaining amounts to be distributed in the Summer of 2023, Spring of 2024 and the Fall of 2024. When received, the Company will recognize the cash proceeds as other income on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Umpqua Credit Facility Amendment On March 13, 2023, ModusLink and Umpqua Bank entered into an amendment to the Umpqua Revolver (the "Umpqua Revolver Amendment") to extend the expiration date of the facility to March 31, 2025. There were no fees associated with the extension. 28 Table of Contents Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The matters discussed in this report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, that involve risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical information provided herein may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those risks discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on November 9, 2022, and other subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management's analysis, judgment, belief or expectation only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof, except as required by law. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Overview Steel Connect, Inc. (the "Company") is a holding company operating through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ModusLink Corporation ("ModusLink" or "Supply Chain"), which serves the supply chain management market. ModusLink provides digital and physical supply chain solutions to many of the world's leading brands across a diverse range of industries, including consumer electronics, telecommunications, computing and storage, software and content, consumer packaged goods, medical devices, retail and luxury and connected devices. These solutions are delivered through a combination of industry expertise, innovative service solutions, and integrated operations, proven business processes, an expansive global footprint and world-class technology. With a global footprint spanning North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region, the Company's solutions and services are designed to improve end-to-end supply chains in order to drive growth, lower costs, and improve profitability. Disposition of IWCO Direct Holdings, Inc. ("IWCO Direct" or "Direct Marketing") Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, with the shutdown of the U.S. economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, IWCO Direct’s business was significantly and adversely affected by a material reduction in customer mailing activities. Against this backdrop, the Company held, on behalf of IWCO Direct, extensive discussions with Cerberus about amending and extending IWCO Direct’s credit facility with Cerberus under which there was approximately $361 million outstanding as of January 31, 2022 that was to mature in December 2022. In addition, the Company’s Board of Directors considered a range of strategic options to address the impending maturity. In mid-January 2022, it became apparent that it would not be possible to extend or refinance the credit facility prior to its maturity. In addition, short-term funding under the revolving credit facility became unavailable. IWCO Direct was in the process of implementing the competitive improvement plan (“CIP”) intended to address the changing requirements of its customers and markets. Despite initial favorable outcomes and improving prospects from the CIP, the Company was unable to amend IWCO Direct's credit facility or identify alternatives to refinance IWCO Direct’s indebtedness given the magnitude of that indebtedness relative to the performance of IWCO Direct’s business. In light of these developments, the Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders to pursue an orderly and consensual disposition of IWCO Direct to the Cerberus-led investor group. Although the Board of Directors considered other alternatives for IWCO Direct, the Board of Directors concluded that such alternatives would not be viable and on February 25, 2022, the Company completed the disposition of IWCO Direct to the Cerberus-led investor group (the entire transaction being referred to as the “IWCO Direct Disposal”). The Company did not receive any cash consideration from the Cerberus-led investor group in exchange for the disposition of IWCO Direct. The Company deconsolidated IWCO Direct as of February 25, 2022 as it no longer held a controlling financial interest as of that date. The results of IWCO Direct are presented as a discontinued operation in all periods reported. Refer to Note 1 - "Nature of Operations" and Note 4 - "Discontinued Operations" to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on the IWCO Direct Disposal. Customers
29 Table of Contents Historically, a limited number of key clients have accounted for a significant percentage of the Company's revenue. For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's ten largest clients accounted for approximately 85.9% and 81.5% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. Two clients accounted for 47.9% and 10.4% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2023, and two clients accounted for 26.3% and 16.2% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2022. No other clients accounted for more than 10.0% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2023 or 2022.
For the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's ten largest clients accounted for approximately 83.8% and 80.0% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. Two clients accounted for 42.1% and 12.7% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for six months ended January 31, 2023, and two clients accounted for 26.0% and 13.0% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for six months ended January 31, 2022. No other clients accounted for more than 10.0% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the six months ended January 31, 2023 or 2022. In general, the Company does not have any agreements which obligate any client to buy a minimum amount of services from it or designate it as an exclusive service provider. Consequently, the Company's net revenue is subject to demand variability by our clients. The level and timing of orders placed by the Company's clients vary for a variety of reasons, including seasonal buying by end-users, the introduction of new technologies and general economic conditions. By diversifying into new markets and improving the operational support structure for its clients, the Company expects to offset the adverse financial impact such factors may bring about. COVID-19 Update The COVID-19 pandemic (in particular, the emergence of new variants of the virus across the globe) has caused, and may continue to cause, significant disruptions in the U.S. and global economies. Measures taken by national and local governments in the United States and around the world restricted, and in certain jurisdictions continue to restrict, individuals’ daily activities and curtail or cease many businesses’ normal operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may further adversely impact, nearly all aspects of our business and markets, including our workforce and the operations of our clients, suppliers, and business partners. We experienced disruptions to our business continuity as a result of temporary closures of certain of ModusLink’s facilities in 2020 and 2021; however, these temporary closures did not have a significant impact on ModusLink’s operations. Outbreaks in Mainland China throughout 2022 (March to May, July and September to October) led to temporary lockdown orders impacting several ModusLink facilities in China; however, ModusLink was able to resume operations at all facilities and the lockdowns have not had a significant impact to ModusLink’s operations through the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If the situation continues at this level or worsens, however, it could result in a potential adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks on all aspects of our business and geographies, including its impact on our clients, employees, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. We believe that such impacts could include the continued disruption to the demand for our businesses' products and services; disruptions in or closures of our business operations or those of our customers or suppliers; the impact of the global business and economic environment on liquidity and the availability of capital; increased costs and delays in payments of outstanding receivables beyond normal payment terms; supply chain disruptions; uncertain demand; and the effect of any initiatives or programs that we may undertake to address financial and operational challenges faced by our customers. Despite indications of economic recovery, the severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business in the future is difficult to predict and will depend on a number of uncertain factors and trends. Such factors and trends include, but are not limited to: the emergence of new variant strains; the widespread use of vaccines; the impact of the global business and economic environment on liquidity and the availability of capital; the extent and severity of the impact on our customers and suppliers; and U.S. and foreign government actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, to mitigate adverse economic or other impacts or to mitigate the spread of the virus and its variants. The Company continues to monitor for any developments or updates to COVID-19 guidelines from public health and governmental authorities, as well as the protection of the health and safety of its personnel, and is continuously working to ensure that its health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols are in place to help mitigate any negative impacts of COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks on the Company’s employees, business or operations. Terminated Merger with Steel Holdings On June 12, 2022, the Company, Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (“Steel Holdings”) and SP Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Steel Holdings (“Merger Sub”), entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly

Favorable (unfavorable) change Three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2022 Net Revenue: During the three months ended January 31, 2023, net revenue for the Supply Chain segment decreased by approximately $3.5 million. The decrease in net revenue was driven by lower volumes associated with clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets during the three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on the Supply Chain segment's net revenues for the three months ended January 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Cost of Revenue: Cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses related to the cost of materials purchased in connection with the provision of supply chain management services, as well as costs for salaries and benefits, depreciation expense, severance, contract labor, consulting, fulfillment and shipping, and applicable facilities costs. Total cost of revenue decreased by $5.7 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by a decrease in cost of materials as a result of the decrease in net revenue discussed above. Cost of revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2023 included materials procured on behalf of our Supply Chain clients of $21.1 million, as compared to $25.7 million for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of $4.6 million, driven by lower volumes for clients in the computing and consumer electronics market. The remaining $1.1 million decrease is driven by lower labor costs, such as a decrease in salaries and wages and production costs, and due to severance charges in the three months ended January 31, 2022 that did not recur. Gross Profit: Gross profit percentage for the current quarter increased 560 basis points, to 25.7% as compared to 20.1% in the prior year quarter, driven by higher value added revenue for a major client in the computing and consumer electronics market and to a lesser extent the impact of severance charges in the three months ended January 31, 2022 that did not recur. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on Supply Chain's gross margin for the three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year.

Selling, general and administrative expenses during the three months ended January 31, 2023 increased by approximately $0.5 million as compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in legal fees for Corporate-level activity. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the three months ended January 31, 2023 for the Supply Chain segment did not change significantly as compared to the same period in the prior year. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Restructuring: During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, ModusLink implemented a strategic plan to reorganize its sales function and the e-Business operations.

In November 2021, ModusLink amended its strategic plan to include reorganizing its supply chain operations and recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $0.9 million during the three months ended January 31, 2022. There were no restructuring costs recorded during the three months ended January 31, 2023 which is driving the decrease in costs period over period. Interest Expense: Total interest expense increased by $0.1 million during the three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense related to accretion of the discount on the 7.50% Convertible Senior Note due 2024 (the "SPHG Note"). Other Losses, Net: 32 Table of Contents Other losses, net are primarily composed of foreign exchange losses, interest income, and sublease income. The $2.6 million increase in other losses, net is primarily driven by a $3.0 million increase in foreign exchange losses between the current year quarter and the prior year quarter. The Company recorded $3.3 million of foreign exchange losses compared to $0.3 million of foreign exchange losses during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in foreign exchange losses is primarily driven by unrealized losses incurred, particularly for changes in the China Renminbi and the Singapore Dollar. Income Tax Benefit (Expense): During the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $0.3 million as compared to $0.7 million in income tax expense for the same period in the prior fiscal year.

The Company provides for income tax expense related to federal, state and foreign income taxes. The Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain of its foreign subsidiaries due to the uncertainty of realizing such benefits. Loss from Continuing Operations: Net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended January 31, 2023 decreased $1.0 million as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, driven by the $1.1 million favorable change in income taxes. Refer to discussion above for further details. Loss from Discontinued Operations: Net loss from discontinued operations for the three months ended January 31, 2022 was $21.5 million, and reflects the net loss for IWCO Direct. IWCO Direct was deconsolidated in February 2022, and as such, there was no activity from discontinued operations for the three months ended January 31, 2023.

Cost of revenue for the six months ended January 31, 2023 included materials procured on behalf of our Supply Chain clients of $40.4 million, as compared to $44.7 million for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of $4.3 million, driven by lower costs on programs launched in the prior year period along with lower material costs related to programs that ended during the current year period. Total cost of revenue decreased by $3.6 million for the six months ended January 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in material costs discussed above, offset partially by higher labor costs as a result of overall higher revenue volume. Gross Profit: Gross profit percentage for the six months ended January 31, 2023 increased 620 basis points, to 26.8% as compared to 20.6% for the six months ended January 31, 2022, driven by an increase in value added revenue for a major client in the computing and consumer electronics market.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Supply Chain segment increased $1.0 million primarily due to bad debt expense recorded for a client in the consumer products industry in first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Corporate-level activity increased $1.0 million primarily due to an increase in legal and other professional fees. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended January 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Restructuring: During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, ModusLink implemented a strategic plan to reorganize its sales function and the e-Business operations.

Foreign exchange gains (losses) did not change significantly as compared to the same period in the prior year.

Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations: Net income from continuing operations for the
six months ended January 31, 2023 increased $6.9 million, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in net income from continuing operations is primarily due to the increase in gross profit, a decrease in restructuring and income tax expense, and an increase in other gains, net, partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses. Refer to explanations above for further details regarding specific increases or decreases. Loss from Discontinued Operations: Net loss from discontinued operations for the six months ended January 31, 2022 was $40.0 million, and reflects the net loss for IWCO Direct. IWCO Direct was deconsolidated in February 2022, and as such, there was no activity from discontinued operations for the six months ended January 31, 2023. See Note 4 - "Discontinued Operations" to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 included of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Liquidity and Capital Resources Anticipated Sources and Uses of Cash Flow Historically, the Company has financed its operations and met its capital requirements primarily through funds generated from operations, the sale of it securities, borrowings from lending institutions and sale of facilities that were not fully utilized. The following table summarizes our liquidity: January 31, 2023 (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 62,427  Readily available borrowing capacity under Umpqua Revolver 11,890  $ 74,317  Due to the changes reflected in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 ("U.S. Tax Reform"), there is no U.S. tax payable upon repatriating the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered not subject to permanent investment. Foreign withholding taxes would range from 0% to 10% on any repatriated funds. For the Company, earnings and profits have been calculated at each subsidiary. The Company's foreign subsidiaries are in an overall net deficit for earnings and profits purposes. As such, no adjustment was made to U.S. taxable income in the six months ended January 31, 2023 relating to this aspect of the U.S. Tax Reform. In future years, the Company will be able to repatriate its foreign earnings without incurring additional U.S. tax as a result of a 100% dividends received deduction. The Company believes that any future withholding taxes or state taxes associated with such a repatriation would not be material. Consolidated excess working capital was $32.6 million as of January 31, 2023, as compared to $26.0 million at July 31, 2022. Included in excess working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $62.4 million as of January 31, 2023 and $53.1 million at July 31, 2022. The increase in excess working capital was primarily driven by higher cash and cash equivalents as a result of increased collections on accounts receivable. Sources and uses of cash for the six months ended January 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in the prior year, are as follows: Six months ended January 31, 2023 2022 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 9,588  $ (2,722) Net cash used in investing activities $ (850) $ (826) Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,112) $ (1,110) Operating Activities:
We generated cash of $9.6 million from operating activities during the six months ended January 31, 2023, an improvement of $12.3 million compared with $2.7 million used in operating activities during the six months ended January 31, 2022. The Company's future cash flows related to operating activities are dependent on several factors, including
35 Table of Contents profitability, accounts receivable collections, effective inventory management practices and optimization of the credit terms of certain vendors of the Company, and overall performance of the technology sector impacting the Supply Chain segment. The change in cash provided by operating activities as compared to cash used in operating activities the prior fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in net income of $6.9 million and an increase in accounts receivable collections of $9.4 million, offset by an increase in payments on outstanding accounts payable of $6.6 million. Investing Activities:
Net cash used in investing activities was $0.9 million and $0.8 million during the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was primarily related to capital expenditures. The slight increase was primarily due to lower capital spending in the prior year as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Financing Activities:
Net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 million during both the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, and primarily consisted of $1.1 million of preferred dividend payments in both periods. Debt and Financing Arrangements Following is a summary of Company’s outstanding debt and financing agreements and preferred stock. Refer to Note 9 – “Debt” and Note 16 – “Related Party Transactions” to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 7.50% Convertible Senior Note On February 28, 2019, the Company entered into that certain 7.50% Convertible Senior Note Due 2024 Purchase Agreement with SPHG Holdings whereby SPHG Holdings loaned the Company $14.9 million in exchange for a 7.50% Convertible Senior Note due 2024 (the "SPHG Note"). The SPHG Note bears interest at the fixed rate of 7.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2019. On March 9, 2023, the Company and SPHG Holdings entered into an amendment to the SPHG Note (the “SPHG Note Amendment”). Pursuant to the SPHG Note Amendment, the maturity date of the SPHG Note was extended six months to September 1, 2024. In addition, the Company repaid $1.0 million in principal amount of the SPHG Note and will be required to repay an additional $1.0 million principal amount of the note on the three month anniversary of the SPHG Note Amendment. In connection with the SPHG Note Amendment, the Company paid SPHG Holdings a cash amendment fee of $0.1 million. The SPHG Note will mature on September 1, 2024 (the "SPHG Note Maturity Date"), unless earlier repurchased by the Company or converted by the holder in accordance with its terms prior to such maturity date. At its election, the Company may pay some or all of the interest due on each interest payment date by increasing the principal amount of the SPHG Note in the amount of such interest due or any portion thereof (such payment of interest by increasing the principal amount of the SPHG Note referred to as "PIK Interest"), with the remaining portion of the interest due on such interest payment date (or, at the Company's election, the entire amount of interest then due) to be paid in cash by the Company. Following an increase in the principal amount of the SPHG Note as a result of a payment of PIK Interest, the SPHG Note will bear interest on such increased principal amount from and after the date of such payment of PIK Interest. SPHG Holdings has the right to require the Company to repurchase the SPHG Note upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes, subject to certain conditions, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the SPHG Note plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company will have the right to elect to cause the mandatory conversion of the SPHG Note in whole, and not in part, at any time on or after March 6, 2022, subject to certain conditions including that the stock price of the Company exceeds a certain threshold. SPHG Holdings has the right, at its option, prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the SPHG Note Maturity Date, to convert the SPHG Note or a portion thereof that is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, into shares of common stock (if the Company has not received a required stockholder approval) or cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, as applicable (if the Company has received a required stockholder approval), at an initial conversion rate of 421.2655 shares of common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $2.37 per share (subject to adjustment as provided in the SPHG Note) per $1,000 principal amount of the SPHG Note (the "Conversion Rate"), subject to, and in accordance with, the settlement provisions of the SPHG Note. For any conversion of the SPHG Note, if the Company is required to obtain and has not received approval from its stockholders in accordance with Nasdaq Stock Market Rule 5635 to issue 20% or more of the total shares of common stock outstanding upon conversion (including upon any mandatory conversion) of the SPHG Note prior to the relevant conversion date (or, if earlier, the 45th scheduled trading day immediately preceding the SPHG Note Maturity Date), the Company shall deliver to the converting holder, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of the SPHG Note being converted, a number of shares of common stock determined by reference to the Conversion Rate, together with a cash payment, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional share of common stock based on the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of its common stock on the relevant conversion date, on the third business day immediately following the relevant conversion date. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, outstanding debt in both periods consisted of the $14.9 million 7.50% Convertible Senior Note due March 1, 2024. As
36 Table of Contents of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the net carrying value of the SPHG Note was $12.1 million, and $11.0 million, respectively. Umpqua Revolver On March 16, 2022, ModusLink, as borrower, submitted a notice of termination to MidCap Financial Trust for its $12.5 million revolving credit facility and entered into a new credit agreement with Umpqua Bank as lender and as agent. There was no balance outstanding on the Midcap Credit Facility of at the time of its termination. The Umpqua Revolver provides for a maximum credit commitment of $12.5 million and a sublimit of $5.0 million for letters of credit and expires on March 16, 2024. Steel Connect, Inc. (“Parent”) is not a borrower or a guarantor under the Umpqua Revolver. Under the Umpqua Revolver, ModusLink is permitted to make distributions to the Parent, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $10.0 million in any fiscal year. On March 13, 2023, ModusLink and Umpqua Bank entered into an amendment to the Umpqua Revolver to extend its expiration date to March 30, 2025. Cerberus Credit Facility
The Cerberus Credit Facility consisted of a term loan facility (the “Cerberus Term Loan”) and a $25 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) (together the “Cerberus Credit Facility”) which was to mature on December 15, 2022. On February 25, 2022, the Company transferred all of its interests in IWCO Direct and the financial obligations of the Cerberus Credit Facility as part of the IWCO Direct Disposal. As a result, the Company has no debt or access to future borrowings under the Cerberus Credit Facility. Preferred Stock On December 15, 2017, the Company entered into a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with SPHG Holdings, pursuant to which the Company issued 35,000 shares of the Company's newly created Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per shares, or the Preferred Stock, to SPHG Holdings at a price of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate purchase consideration of $35.0 million (the "Preferred Stock Transaction"). The terms, rights, obligations and preferences of the Preferred Stock are set forth in a Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the "Series C Certificate of Designations"), which has been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Under the Series C Certificate of Designations, each share of Preferred Stock can be converted into shares of the Company's common stock at an initial conversion price equal to $1.96 per share, subject to appropriate adjustments for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction. Holders of the Preferred Stock will also receive dividends at 6% per annum payable, at the Company's option, in cash or common stock. If at any time the closing bid price of the Company's common stock exceeds 170% of the conversion price for at least five consecutive trading days (subject to appropriate adjustments for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction), the Company has the right to require each holder of Preferred Stock to convert all, or any whole number, of shares of the Preferred Stock into common stock. Upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntary or involuntary, or the merger or consolidation of the Company or significant subsidiary, or the sale of substantially all of the assets or capital stock of the Company or a significant subsidiary, the holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or funds of the Company to the holders of other equity or equity equivalent securities of the Company other than the Preferred Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share in cash equal to the sum of (i) 100% of the stated value per share of Preferred Stock (initially $1,000 per share) then held by them (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or other similar transactions with respect to the Preferred Stock), plus (ii) 100% of all declared but unpaid dividends, and all accrued but unpaid dividends on each such share of Preferred Stock, in each case as the date of the triggering event. On or after December 15, 2022, each holder of Preferred Stock can also require the Company to redeem its Preferred Stock in cash at a price equal to the Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Series C Certificate of Designations), or approximately $35.2 million. If holders of the Preferred Stock exercise this right to require the Company to redeem all the Preferred Stock, the Company’s payment of the redemption price would likely adversely impact the Company’s liquidity and ability to finance its operations. As of January 31, 2023, this right had not been exercised by holders of the Preferred Stock. Steel Connect, Inc. 37 Table of Contents The Parent believes it has access to adequate resources to meet its needs for normal operating costs, debt obligations and working capital for at least the next twelve months. Upon a redemption request of the holder of the Preferred Stock (as discussed above), the Parent believes it is probable that it has access to adequate resources, including cash on hand and potential dividends from ModusLink, to pay the redemption price and continue its operations. ModusLink believes that if dividends to the Parent are required, it would have access to adequate resources to meet its operating needs while remaining in compliance with the Umpqua Revolver's covenants over the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurances that ModusLink will continue to have access to its line of credit under the Umpqua Revolver if its financial performance does not satisfy the financial covenants set forth in its financing agreement, which could also result in the acceleration of its debt obligations by its lender, adversely affecting liquidity. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. "Disclosure controls and procedures" means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based upon that evaluation, management, including the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company's disclosure controls were effective as of January 31, 2023. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
