Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 1.
Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies In this Form 10-Q, unless otherwise stated, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to Campbell Soup Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
The financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in our opinion, necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the indicated periods. The accounting policies we used in preparing these financial statements are substantially consistent with those we applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022.
The results for the period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for other interim periods or the full year. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest July 31, which is July 30, 2023.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that enhances the transparency of supplier finance programs by requiring disclosure of the key terms of these programs and a related rollforward of these obligations to understand the effect on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods in those fiscal years, except for the rollforward requirement, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on our disclosures. 3.

(Snyder's-Lance). Amortization of intangible assets was $ 21
million for both the six-month periods ended January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022. As of January 29, 2023, amortizable intangible assets had a weighted-average remaining useful life of
16
years. Amortization expense for the next 5 years is estimated to be approximately $ 41
million per year.

As of our 2022 annual impairment testing, indefinite-lived trademarks with 10% or less of excess coverage of fair value over carrying value had an aggregate carrying value of $ 434
million and included
Pacific Foods
and
certain other Snacks trademarks. The estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets involve significant management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions.

We evaluate segment performance before interest, taxes and costs associated with restructuring activities and impairment charges. Unrealized gains and losses on outstanding undesignated commodity hedging activities are excluded from segment operating earnings and are recorded in Corporate as these open positions represent hedges of future purchases. Upon closing of the contracts, the realized gain or loss is transferred to segment operating earnings, which allows the segments to reflect the economic effects of the hedge without exposure to quarterly volatility of unrealized gains and losses. Only the service cost component of pension and postretirement expense is allocated to segments. All other components of expense, including interest cost, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service credits and recognized actuarial gains and losses are reflected in Corporate and not included in segment operating results. Asset information by segment is not discretely maintained for internal reporting or used in evaluating performance.

Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives Multi-year Cost Savings Initiatives and Snyder's-Lance Cost Transformation Program and Integration Continuing Operations Beginning in fiscal 2015, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure.
Over the years, we expanded these initiatives by continuing to optimize our supply chain and manufacturing networks, as well as our information technology infrastructure. On March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Prior to the acquisition, Snyder's-Lance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance. We continued to implement this program and identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrated Snyder's-Lance. In 2022, we expanded these initiatives as we continue to pursue cost savings by further optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing network and through effective cost management. In the second quarter of 2023, we announced plans to consolidate our Snacks offices in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Norwalk, Connecticut, into our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. Cost estimates for these expanded initiatives, as well as timing for certain activities, are continuing to be developed. A summary of the pre-tax charges recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to these initiatives is as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended (Millions) January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 Recognized as of January 29, 2023 Restructuring charges $ 9   $ —   $ 9   $ —   $ 273   Administrative expenses 5   3   8   5   367   Cost of products sold —   2   —   4   84   Marketing and selling expenses —   —   —   —   14   Research and development expenses —   —   —   —   4   Total pre-tax charges $ 14   $ 5   $ 17   $ 9   $ 742   A summary of the pre-tax costs associated with the initiatives is as follows: (Millions) Recognized as of January 29, 2023 Severance pay and benefits $ 236   Asset impairment/accelerated depreciation 82   Implementation costs and other related costs 424   Total $ 742   11
The total estimated pre-tax costs for actions that have been identified are approximately $ 860
million to $ 880
million and we expect to incur the costs through 2025. These estimates will be updated as the expanded initiatives are developed. We expect the costs for actions that have been identified to date to consist of the following: approximately $ 245
million to $ 250
million in severance pay and benefits; approximately $ 130
million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation; and approximately $ 485
million to $ 500
million in implementation costs and other related costs. We expect these pre-tax costs to be associated with our segments as follows: Meals & Beverages - approximately
33 %; Snacks - approximately
43 %; and Corporate - approximately
24 %. Of the aggregate $ 860
million to $ 880
million of pre-tax costs identified to date, we expect approximately $ 690
million to $ 710
million will be cash expenditures. In addition, we expect to invest approximately $ 600
million in capital expenditures through 2025, of which we invested $ 441
million as of January 29, 2023.
The capital expenditures primarily relate to optimization of production within our Meals & Beverages manufacturing network, a U.S. warehouse optimization project, improvement of quality, safety and cost structure across the Snyder’s-Lance manufacturing network, implementation of our existing SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Snyder's-Lance, enhancements to our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications and optimization of the Snyder’s-Lance warehouse and distribution network. A summary of the restructuring activity and related reserves at January 29, 2023, is as follows: (Millions) Severance Pay and Benefits Implementation Costs and Other Related Costs (2)

(2) Includes other costs recognized as incurred that are not reflected in the restructuring reserve in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The costs are included in Administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Segment operating results do not include restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges.
A summary of the pre-tax costs associated with segments is as follows: January 29, 2023 (Millions) Three Months Ended Six Months Ended Costs Incurred to Date Meals & Beverages $ —   $ —   $ 225   Snacks 10   10   331   Corporate 4   7   186   Total $ 14   $ 17   $ 742   7.
Earnings per Share (EPS) For the periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, the calculations of basic EPS and EPS assuming dilution vary in that the weighted average shares outstanding assuming dilution include the incremental effect of stock options and other share-based payment awards, except when such effect would be antidilutive. The earnings per share calculation for the three- and six-month periods ended January 29, 2023, excludes less than
1
million stock options that would have been antidilutive. The earnings per share calculation for the three- and six-month periods ended January 30, 2022, excludes approximately
1
million stock options that would have been antidilutive. 12

Pension and Postretirement Benefits Components of net benefit expense (income) were as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended Pension Postretirement Pension Postretirement (Millions) January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 Service cost $ 3   $ 5   $ —   $ —   $ 7   $ 9   $ —   $ —   Interest cost 19   11   1   1   36   21   3   2   Expected return on plan assets ( 25 ) ( 32 ) —   —   ( 52 ) ( 62 ) —   —   Amortization of prior service credit —   —   —   ( 1 ) —   —   —   ( 1 ) Actuarial losses (gains) ( 6 ) ( 10 ) —   —   9   ( 4 ) —   —   Net periodic benefit expense (income) $ ( 9 ) $ ( 26 ) $ 1   $ —   $ —   $ ( 36 ) $ 3   $ 1   The actuarial gains and losses resulted from the remeasurement of pension plans due to lump sum distributions that exceeded or are expected to exceed service and interest costs resulting in settlement accounting for the plans. The actuarial gains recognized for the three-month period ended January 29, 2023 were primarily due to increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation, partially offset by losses on plan assets. The actuarial losses recognized for the six-month period ended January 29, 2023 were primarily due to losses on plan assets, partially offset by increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation. The actuarial gains recognized for the three- and six-month periods ended January 30, 2022 were primarily due to increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation, partially offset by losses on plan assets. 9.
Leases The components of lease costs were as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended (Millions) January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 Operating lease cost $ 20   $ 20   $ 40   $ 39   Finance lease - amortization of right-of-use (ROU) assets 4   4   8   8   Short-term lease cost 17   14   34   27   Variable lease cost (1) 53   49   103   101   Total $ 94   $ 87   $ 185   $ 175   __________________________________________ (1) Includes labor and other overhead in our service contracts with embedded leases.

Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt On November 15, 2022, we entered into a delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the DDTL Credit Agreement) totaling up to $ 500  million scheduled to mature on November 15, 2025. Loans under the DDTL Credit Agreement will bear interest at the rates specified in the DDTL Credit Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The DDTL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a
minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the DDTL Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.25:1.00 , and events of default for credit facilities of this type. We anticipate using $ 500  million of the proceeds of the loans under the DDTL Credit Agreement to refinance our existing $ 566  million Notes with a maturity date of
March 15, 2023 . 11.
Financial Instruments The principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, we are exposed to price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. In order to manage these exposures, we follow established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps, rate locks, options, forwards and commodity futures. We enter into these derivative contracts for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. Our derivative programs include instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment and instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges. Concentration of Credit Risk We are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, we enter into contracts only with carefully selected, leading, credit-worthy financial institutions, and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk. We did not have credit risk-related contingent features in our derivative instruments as of January 29, 2023, or July 31, 2022. We are also exposed to credit risk from our customers. During 2022, our largest customer accounted for approximately
22 % of consolidated net sales. Our five largest customers accounted for approximately
47 % of our consolidated net sales in 2022. We closely monitor credit risk associated with counterpartie s and customers. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, primarily the Canadian dollar, related to intercompany transactions and third-party transactions. We utilize foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures. The contracts are either designated as cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated. We hedge portions of our forecasted foreign currency transaction exposure with foreign exchange forward contracts for periods typically up to
18
months. The notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges was $ 128
million as of January 29, 2023, and $ 140
million as of July 31, 2022. Changes in the fair value on the portion of the derivative included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. For derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in earnings under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument and is presented in the same statement of earnings line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and the amounts recognized in earnings is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income
14
(loss). The notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges was $ 17
million as of January 29, 2023, and $ 13
million as of July 31, 2022. Interest Rate Risk We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. There were
no
interest rate swaps outstanding as of January 29, 2023, or July 31, 2022. Commodity Price Risk We principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. We also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of wheat, diesel fuel, natural gas, soybean oil, aluminum, cocoa, corn, soybean meal and butter. Commodity futures, options and swap contracts are either designated as cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated. We hedge a portion of commodity requirements for periods typically up to
18
months. The notional amount of commodity contracts designated as cash-flow hedges was $ 3
million as of July 31, 2022. There were
no
commodity contracts designated as cash-flow hedges as of January 29, 2023. Changes in the fair value on the portion of the derivative included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. The notional amount of commodity contracts not designated as accounting hedges was $ 246
million as of January 29, 2023, and $ 254
million as of July 31, 2022. The change in fair value on undesignated instruments is recorded in Cost of products sold. We have a supply contract under which prices for certain raw materials are established based on anticipated volume requirements over a twelve-month period. Certain prices under the contract are based in part on certain component parts of the raw materials that are in excess of our needs or not required for our operations, thereby creating an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. We net settle amounts due under the contract with our counterparty. The notional amount was $ 106
million as of January 29, 2023, and $ 39
million as of July 31, 2022. The change in fair value on the embedded derivative is recorded in Cost of products sold. Deferred Compensation Obligation Price Risk We enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to the total return of certain deferred compensation obligations. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Unrealized gains (losses) and settlements are included in Administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We enter into these contracts for periods typically not exceeding
12
months. The notional amounts of the contracts were $ 50
million as of January 29, 2023, and July 31, 2022. 15
The following table summarizes the fair value of derivative instruments on a gross basis as recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 29, 2023, and July 31, 2022: (Millions) Balance Sheet Classification January 29, 2023 July 31, 2022 Asset Derivatives Derivatives designated as hedges: Commodity contracts Other current assets $ —   $ 3   Foreign exchange forward contracts Other current assets 3   2   Total derivatives designated as hedges $ 3   $ 5   Derivatives not designated as hedges: Commodity contracts Other current assets $ 9   $ 20   Deferred compensation contracts Other current assets 5   —   Total derivatives not designated as hedges $ 14   $ 20   Total asset derivatives $ 17   $ 25   (Millions) Balance Sheet Classification January 29, 2023 July 31, 2022 Liability Derivatives Derivatives designated as hedges: Foreign exchange forward contracts Accrued liabilities $ 1   $ —   Total derivatives designated as hedges $ 1   $ —   Derivatives not designated as hedges: Commodity contracts Accrued liabilities $ 18   $ 30   Deferred compensation contracts Accrued liabilities —   4   Total derivatives not designated as hedges $ 18   $ 34   Total liability derivatives $ 19   $ 34   We do not offset the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities executed with the same counterparty that are generally subject to enforceable netting agreements. However, if we were to offset and record the asset and liability balances of derivatives on a net basis, the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 29, 2023, and July 31, 2022, would be adjusted as detailed in the following table: January 29, 2023 July 31, 2022 (Millions) Gross Amounts Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Gross Amounts Not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Subject to Netting Agreements Net Amount Gross Amounts Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Gross Amounts Not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Subject to Netting Agreements Net Amount Total asset derivatives $ 17   $ ( 6 ) $ 11   $ 25   $ ( 17 ) $ 8   Total liability derivatives $ 19   $ ( 6 ) $ 13   $ 34   $ ( 17 ) $ 17   We are required to maintain cash margin accounts in connection with funding the settlement of open positions for exchange-traded commodity derivative instruments. Cash margin asset balances of $ 17

Fair Value Measurements We categorize financial assets and liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy: • Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. • Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with observable market data. • Level 3: Unobservable inputs, which are valued based on our estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. When available, we use unadjusted quoted market prices to measure the fair value and classify such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, we base fair value upon internally developed models that use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency rates. Included in the fair value of derivative instruments is an adjustment for credit and nonperformance risk. 18
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following tables present our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 29, 2023, and July 31, 2022, consistent with the fair value hierarchy:   Fair Value as of January 29, 2023 Fair Value Measurements at January 29, 2023 Using Fair Value Hierarchy Fair Value as of July 31, 2022 Fair Value Measurements at July 31, 2022 Using Fair Value Hierarchy (Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets Foreign exchange forward contracts (1) $ 3   $ —   $ 3   $ —   $ 2   $ —  $ 2   $ —  Commodity derivative contracts (2) 9   2   2   5   23   —   19   4   Deferred compensation derivative contracts (3) 5   —   5   —   —   —  —   —  Deferred compensation investments (4) 1   1   —   —   2   2   —  —  Total assets at fair value $ 18   $ 3   $ 10   $ 5   $ 27   $ 2   $ 21   $ 4     Fair Value as of January 29, 2023 Fair Value Measurements at January 29, 2023 Using Fair Value Hierarchy Fair Value as of July 31, 2022 Fair Value Measurements at July 31, 2022 Using Fair Value Hierarchy (Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Liabilities Foreign exchange forward

The
following table summarizes the changes in fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities for the six-month periods ended January 29, 2023, and January 30, 2022:
Six Months Ended (Millions) January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 Fair value at beginning of year $ 4   $ 1   Gains (losses) 5   20   Settlements ( 4 ) ( 6 ) Fair value at end of quarter $ 5   $ 15   Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value. There were $ 26
million of cash equivalents at January 29, 2023, and $ 27
million at July 31, 2022. Cash equivalents represent fair value as these highly liquid investments have an original maturity of three months or less. Fair value of cash equivalents is based on Level 2 inputs. The fair value of short- and long-term debt was $ 4.29
billion at January 29, 2023, and $ 4.637
billion at July 31, 2022. The carrying value was $ 4.57
billion at January 29, 2023, and $ 4.81
billion at July 31, 2022. The fair value of long-term debt is principally estimated using Level 2 inputs based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. 13.
Share Repurchases In June 2021, the Board authorized an anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to $ 250
million (June 2021 program) to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs. The June 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the June 2021 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. In September 2021, the Board approved a strategic share repurchase program of up to $ 500
million (September 2021 program). The September 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the September 2021 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions.
During the six-month period ended January 29, 2023, we repurchased
1.298
million shares at a cost of $ 66
million pursuant to our June 2021 program. As of January 29, 2023, approximately $ 106
million remained available under the June 2021 program and approximately $ 375
million remained available under the September 2021 program. During the six-month period ended January 30, 2022, we repurchased approximately
1.5
million shares at a cost of $ 65
million. 14.
Stock-based Compensation We provide compensation benefits by issuing stock options, unrestricted stock and restricted stock units (including time-lapse restricted stock units, EPS performance restricted stock units, total shareholder return (TSR) performance restricted stock units and free cash flow (FCF) performance restricted stock units). In 2023, we issued time-lapse restricted stock units, unrestricted stock, TSR performance restricted stock units and EPS performance restricted stock units. We last issued stock options and FCF performance restricted stock units in 2019.
In determining stock-based compensation expense, we estimate forfeitures expected to occur.
Total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense and tax-related benefits recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings were as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended (Millions) January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 Total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense $ 16   $ 17   $ 31   $ 31   Tax-related benefits $ 3   $ 3   $ 6   $ 5   20
The following table summarizes stock option activity as of January 29, 2023: Options Weighted- Average Exercise Price Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life Aggregate Intrinsic Value (Options in thousands)   (In years) (Millions) Outstanding at July 31, 2022 1,297   $ 46.04   Granted —   $ —   Exercised ( 464 ) $ 48.33   Terminated —   $ —   Outstanding at January 29, 2023 833   $ 44.77   4.7 $ 6   Exercisable at January 29, 2023 833   $ 44.77   4.7 $ 6   The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the six-month period ended January 29, 2023 was $ 3
million. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the six-month period ended January 30, 2022 was
not
material. We measured the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
We expensed stock options on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, except for awards issued to retirement eligible participants, which we expensed on an accelerated basis. As of January 2022, compensation related to stock options was fully expensed. The following table summarizes time-lapse restricted stock units and EPS performance restricted stock units as of
January 29, 2023: Units Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (Restricted stock units in thousands)   Nonvested at July 31, 2022 1,946   $ 43.88   Granted 1,148   $ 47.36   Vested ( 735 ) $ 45.23   Forfeited ( 100 ) $ 44.86   Nonvested at January 29, 2023 2,259   $ 45.16   We determine the fair value of time-lapse restricted stock units based on the quoted price of our stock at the date of grant. We expense time-lapse restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible participants, which we expense on an accelerated basis.
In 2023 and 2022, we granted EPS performance restricted stock units that will be earned upon the achievement of our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate goal, measured over a
three-year
period. The actual number of EPS performance restricted stock units issued at the vesting date could range from
0 % to
200 % of the initial grant depending on actual performance achieved. The fair value of EPS performance restricted stock units is based upon the quoted price of our stock at the date of grant. We expense EPS performance restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the service period, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible participants, which we expense on an accelerated basis. We estimate expense based on the number of awards expected to vest. There were
564  thousand EPS performance target grants outstanding at January 29, 2023, with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $ 44.33 . In 2019, we issued approximately
388
thousand FCF performance restricted stock units for which vesting was contingent upon achievement of free cash flow (defined as Net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and certain investing and financing activities) compared to annual operating plan objectives over a three-year period. An annual objective was established each fiscal year for three consecutive years. Performance against these objectives was averaged at the end of the three-year period to determine the number of underlying units that would vest at the end of the
three years . The actual number of FCF performance restricted stock units issued at the vesting date could have ranged from
0 % to
200 % of the initial grant depending on actual performance achieved. The fair value of FCF performance restricted stock units was based upon the quoted price of our stock at the date of grant. We expensed FCF performance restricted stock units over the requisite service period of each objective. We estimated expense based on the number of awards expected to vest. In the first quarter of 2022, recipients of FCF performance restricted stock units earned
167 % of the initial grants based upon the average of actual performance achieved during a three-year period ended August 1, 2021. As a result, approximately
158
thousand additional shares were awarded. As of October 31, 2021, there were
no
FCF performance target grants outstanding. 21
As of January 29, 2023, total remaining unearned compensation related to nonvested time-lapse restricted stock units and EPS performance restricted stock units was $ 60
million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of
1.9
years. The fair value of restricted stock units vested during the six-month periods ended January 29, 2023, and January 30, 2022, was $ 35
million and $ 49
million, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the restricted stock units granted during the six-month period ended January 30, 2022 was $ 41.79 . The following table summarizes TSR performance restricted stock units as of January 29, 2023: Units Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value (Restricted stock units in thousands)   Nonvested at July 31, 2022 1,153   $ 55.63   Granted 296   $ 53.74   Vested ( 443 ) $ 63.06   Forfeited ( 52 ) $ 51.69   Nonvested at January 29, 2023 954   $ 51.81   We estimated the fair value of TSR performance restricted stock units at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. Weighted-average assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation were as follows:   2023 2022 Risk-free interest rate 4.29 % 0.46 % Expected dividend yield 3.09 % 3.50 % Expected volatility 26.40 % 27.42 % Expected term 3
years 3
years We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period, except for awards issued to retirement eligible participants, which we expense on an accelerated basis. As of January 29, 2023, total remaining unearned compensation related to TSR performance restricted stock units was $ 20
million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of
1.8
years. In the first quarter of 2023, recipients of TSR performance restricted stock units earned

Commitments and Contingencies Regulatory and Litigation Matters
We are involved in various pending or threatened legal or regulatory proceedings, including purported class actions, arising from the conduct of business both in the ordinary course and otherwise. Modern pleading practice in the U.S. permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court. In addition, jurisdictions may permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for similar matters. This variability in pleadings, together with our actual experiences in litigating or resolving through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of time, demonstrates to us that the monetary relief which may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to its merits or disposition value. Due to the unpredictable nature of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time is normally difficult to ascertain. Uncertainties can include how fact finders will evaluate documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal. Disposition valuations are
22
also subject to the uncertainty of how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the relevant evidence and applicable law. We establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when information related to the loss contingencies shows both that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that some matters could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated as of January 29, 2023. While the potential future charges could be material in a particular quarter or annual period, based on information currently known by us, we do not believe any such charges are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Other Contingencies We have provided certain indemnifications in connection with divestitures, contracts and other transactions. Certain indemnifications have finite expiration dates. Liabilities recognized based on known exposures related to such matters were not material at January 29, 2023. 16.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW
This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements," and our Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022, including but not limited to "Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Executive Summary Unless otherwise stated, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to Campbell Soup Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products. We operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories. Business Trends We have been actively monitoring the impact of the dynamic macroeconomic environment, including input cost inflation, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic, on all aspects of our business.
We anticipate that 2023 will continue to be a dynamic macroeconomic environment and we expect elevated levels of input cost inflation to persist throughout 2023. We will continue to take actions to mitigate a portion of this inflationary pressure, but we do not expect such benefits will fully offset the incremental costs in 2023.
While we as a North American focused company have no direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine, we have experienced volatility in costs due, in part, to the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on the global economy. To date, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has not had any material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
There still remains uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic. The ultimate impact depends on the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the emergence and spread of new COVID-19 variants and resurgences, the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines and actions taken by government authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. We will continue to evaluate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income excluding any actuarial losses or gains is estimated to be approximately $45 million lower in 2023, subject to the impact of interim remeasurements. The decrease in 2023 is due to increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations and a decline in the market value of plan assets. Summary of Results This Summary of Results provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows.
• Net sales increased 12% in the quarter to $2.485 billion due to favorable inflation-driven net price realization, partially offset by volume/mix declines.
• Gross profit, as a percent of sales, was 30.5% in 2023 compared to 30.3% in the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily due to favorable net price realization and supply chain productivity improvements, partially offset by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs as well as unfavorable volume/mix. • Earnings per share were $.77 in 2023, compared to $.70 a year ago. The current quarter included expenses of $.03 per share and the prior-year quarter included gains of $.01 per share from items impacting comparability as discussed below.

Net Earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company
The following items impacted the comparability of net earnings and net earnings per share: • We implemented several cost savings initiatives in recent years. In the second quarter of 2023, we recorded Restructuring charges of $9 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $5 million in Administrative expenses (aggregate impact of $10 million after tax, or $.03 per share) related to these initiatives. Year-to-date in 2023, we recorded Restructuring charges of $9 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $8 million in Administrative expenses (aggregate impact of $13 million after tax, or $.04 per share) related to these initiatives. In the second quarter of 2022, we recorded implementation costs and other related costs of $3 million in Administrative expenses and $2 million in Cost of products sold (aggregate impact of $4 million after tax, or $.01 per share) related to these initiatives. Year-to-date in 2022, we recorded implementation costs and other related costs of $5 million in Administrative expenses and $4 million in Cost of products sold (aggregate impact of $7 million after tax, or $.02 per share) related to these initiatives. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives" for additional information; • In the second quarter of 2023, we recognized actuarial gains in Other expenses / (income) of $6 million ($4 million after tax, or $.01 per share). Year-to-date in 2023, we recognized actuarial losses in Other expenses / (income) of $9 million ($7 million after tax, or $.02 per share). In the second quarter of 2022, we recognized actuarial gains in Other expenses / (income) of $10 million ($8 million after tax, or $.03 per share). Year-to-date in 2022, we recognized actuarial gains in Other expenses / (income) of $4 million ($3 million after tax, or $.01 per share). The actuarial gains and losses related to interim remeasurements of certain pension plans due to lump sum distributions that exceeded or are expected to exceed service and interest costs resulting in settlement accounting for the plans; and • In the second quarter of 2023, we recognized losses in Cost of products sold of $4 million ($3 million after tax, or $.01 per share) associated with unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges. Year-to-date in 2022, we recognized losses in Cost of products sold of $3 million ($2 million after tax, or $.01 per share) associated with unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges.

After adjusting for items impacting comparability, earnings increased reflecting an improved gross profit, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses, higher other expenses, a higher effective tax rate and higher administrative expenses. Earnings per share benefited from a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding. SECOND-QUARTER DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Sales An analysis of net sales by reportable segment follows: Three Months Ended (Millions) January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 % Change Meals & Beverages $ 1,408   $ 1,275  10 Snacks 1,077   934  15 $ 2,485   $ 2,209  12 An analysis of percent change of net sales by reportable segment follows: Meals & Beverages Snacks Total Volume and mix (4)% 2% (2)% Net price realization (1) 15 13 14 Currency (1) — — 10% 15% 12% __________________________________________ (1) Includes revenue reductions from trade promotion and consumer coupon redemption programs. In Meals & Beverages, sales increased 10% primarily due to increases in U.S. retail products, including U.S. soup,
Prego
pasta sauces and
Pace
Mexican sauces, as well as gains in foodservice. Favorable net price realization was partially offset by modest volume/mix declines. Sales of U.S. soup increased 7% primarily due to increases in ready-to-serve soups and condensed soups. In Snacks, sales increased 15% driven by sales of our power brands, which increased 20%. Sales increased due to increases in cookies and crackers, primarily
Goldfish
crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies, and in salty snacks, primarily
Snyder’s of Hanover
pretzels,
Snack Factory
pretzel crisps and
Kettle Brand
potato chips. Sales benefited from favorable net price realization and volume/mix increases lapping significant supply constraints in the prior year.
Gross Profit Gross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold, increased by $90 million in 2023 from 2022. As a percent of sales, gross profit was 30.5% in 2023 and 30.3% in 2022.
The 20 basis-point increase in gross profit margin was due to the following factors: Margin Impact Net price realization 1,020 Productivity improvements 280 Cost inflation, supply chain costs and other factors (1) (1,150) Volume/mix (2) (130) 20 __________________________________________ (1) Includes a 10 basis-point impact from the change in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges. (2) Includes the impact of operating leverage. 26
Marketing and Selling Expenses Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 8.7% in 2023 compared to 8.9% in 2022. Marketing and selling expenses increased 10% in 2023 from 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expense (approximately 8 points) and higher selling expenses (approximately 5 points), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 4 points). The increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense was due in part to moderated levels in the prior year from supply constraints. Administrative Expenses Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 6.5% in 2023 compared to 6.7% in 2022. Administrative expenses increased 10% in 2023 from 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher general administrative costs and inflation (approximately 6 points), higher benefit-related costs (approximately 3 points) and higher incentive compensation (approximately 3 points), partially offset by lower expenses related to the settlement of certain legal claims (approximately 3 points). Other Expenses / (Income) Other expenses / (income) were $0 million in 2023 compared to other income of $19 million in 2022. Other expenses / (income) in 2023 included pension actuarial gains of $6 million. Other income in 2022 included pension actuarial gains of $10 million. Excluding these amounts, the remaining change was primarily due to lower net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income in the current year. Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings increased 19% in 2023 from 2022.
An analysis of operating earnings by segment follows: Three Months Ended (Millions) January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 % Change Meals & Beverages $ 249 $ 213 17 Snacks 150 121 24 399 334 19 Corporate income (expense) (40) (11) Restructuring charges (1) (9) — Earnings before interest and taxes $ 350 $ 323 __________________________________________ (1) See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring charges. Operating earnings from Meals & Beverages increased 17%. The increase was primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses. Gross profit margin increased slightly due to favorable net price realization and supply chain productivity improvements, partially offset by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs as well as unfavorable volume/mix. Operating earnings from Snacks increased 24%. The increase was primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses. Gross profit margin increased due to favorable net price realization and supply chain productivity improvements, partially offset by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs.
Corporate expense in 2023 included costs of $5 million related to costs savings initiatives, unrealized mark-to-market losses on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges of $4 million and pension actuarial gains of $6 million. Corporate expense in 2022 included costs of $5 million related to cost savings initiatives and pension actuarial gains of $10 million. Excluding these amounts, the remaining increase was primarily due to lower net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income in the current year and higher administrative expenses. Interest Expense Interest expense of $45 million in 2023 was comparable to 2022. Taxes on Earnings The effective tax rate was 23.9% in 2023 and 23.5% in 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of state tax law changes in 2022. 27

Marketing and selling expenses increased 14% in 2023 from 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expense (approximately 11 points) and higher selling expenses (approximately 7 points), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 3 points). The increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense was due in part to moderated levels in the prior year from supply constraints.

Corporate expense in 2023 included pension actuarial losses of $9 million and costs of $8 million related to costs savings initiatives. Corporate expense in 2022 included costs of $9 million related to cost savings initiatives, unrealized mark-to-market losses on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges of $3 million and pension actuarial gains of $4 million. Excluding these amounts, the remaining increase was primarily due to lower net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income in the current year and higher administrative expenses. Interest Expense Interest expense of $92 million in 2023 was comparable to 2022. Taxes on Earnings The effective tax rate was 23.9% in 2023 and 21.9% in 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the benefit from the favorable resolution of several tax matters and state tax law changes in 2022. Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives Multi-year Cost Savings Initiatives and Snyder's-Lance Cost Transformation Program and Integration Continuing Operations Beginning in fiscal 2015, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure.
Over the years, we expanded these initiatives by continuing to optimize our supply chain and manufacturing networks, as well as our information technology infrastructure. 29
On March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Prior to the acquisition, Snyder's-Lance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance. We continued to implement this program and identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrated Snyder's-Lance. In 2022, we expanded these initiatives as we continue to pursue cost savings by further optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing network and through effective cost management. In the second quarter of 2023, we announced plans to consolidate our Snacks offices in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Norwalk, Connecticut, into our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. Cost estimates for these expanded initiatives, as well as timing for certain activities, are continuing to be developed. A summary of the pre-tax charges recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to these initiatives is as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended (Millions, except per share amounts) January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 January 29, 2023 January 30, 2022 Recognized as of January 29, 2023 Restructuring charges $ 9   $ —  $ 9   $ —  $ 273  Administrative expenses 5   3  8   5  367  Cost of products sold —   2  —   4  84  Marketing and selling expenses —   —  —   —  14  Research and development expenses —   —  —   —  4  Total pre-tax charges $ 14   $ 5  $ 17   $ 9  $ 742  Aggregate after-tax impact $ 10   $ 4  $ 13   $ 7  Per share impact $ .03   $ .01  $ .04   $ .02  A summary of the pre-tax costs associated with these initiatives is as follows: (Millions) Recognized as of January 29, 2023 Severance pay and benefits $ 236  Asset impairment/accelerated depreciation 82  Implementation costs and other related costs 424  Total $ 742  The total estimated pre-tax costs for actions that have been identified are approximately $860 million to $880 million and we expect to incur the costs through 2025. These estimates will be updated as the expanded initiatives are developed. We expect the costs for actions that have been identified to date to consist of the following: approximately $245 million to $250 million in severance pay and benefits; approximately $130 million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation; and approximately $485 million to $500 million in implementation costs and other related costs. We expect these pre-tax costs to be associated with our segments as follows: Meals & Beverages - approximately 33%; Snacks - approximately 43%; and Corporate - approximately 24%. Of the aggregate $860 million to $880 million of pre-tax costs identified to date, we expect approximately $690 million to $710 million will be cash expenditures. In addition, we expect to invest approximately $600 million in capital expenditures through 2025, of which we invested $441 million as of January 29, 2023. The capital expenditures primarily relate to optimization of production within our Meals & Beverages manufacturing network, a U.S. warehouse optimization project, improvement of quality, safety and cost structure across the Snyder’s-Lance manufacturing network, implementation of our existing SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Snyder's-Lance, enhancements to our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications and optimization of the Snyder’s-Lance warehouse and distribution network. We expect to fund the costs through cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings. We expect the initiatives, once all phases are implemented, to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately $1 billion by the end of 2025. As of January 29, 2023, we have generated total program-to-date pre-tax savings of $870 million. 30
Segment operating results do not include restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges. A summary of the pre-tax costs associated with segments is as follows: January 29, 2023 (Millions) Three Months Ended Six Months Ended Costs Incurred to Date Meals & Beverages $ —  $ —  $ 225  Snacks 10  10  331  Corporate 4  7  186  Total $ 14  $ 17  $ 742  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, which may include commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements. We generated cash flows from operations of $732 million in 2023, compared to $766 million in 2022. The decline in 2023 was primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher cash earnings. Current assets are less than current liabilities as a result of our level of current maturities of long-term debt and short-term borrowings and our focus to lower core working capital requirements. We had negative working capital of $612 million as of January 29, 2023, and $923 million as of July 31, 2022. Total debt maturing within one year was $578 million as of January 29, 2023, and $814 million as of July 31, 2022. Capital expenditures were $155 million in 2023 and $129 million in 2022. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $325 million in 2023. Capital expenditures in the first six months of 2023 included chip and cracker capacity expansion for our Snacks business and a new manufacturing line for our Meals & Beverages business. In Snacks, we have a direct-store-delivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors. In order to maintain and expand this model, we routinely purchase and sell routes. The purchase and sale proceeds of the routes are reflected in investing activities. Dividend payments were $226 million in 2023 and $228 million in 2022. The regular quarterly dividend paid on our capital stock was $.37 per share in both the second quarter of 2023 and 2022. On November 30, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $.37 per share payable on January 30, 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 5, 2023. On March 1, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $.37 per share payable on May 1, 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 6, 2023.
In June 2021, the Board authorized an anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to $250 million (June 2021 program) to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs. The June 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the anti-dilutive program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. In September 2021, the Board approved a strategic share repurchase program of up to $500 million (September 2021 program). The September 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the September 2021 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. We repurchased 1.298 million shares at a cost of $66 million in 2023 pursuant to our June 2021 program. As of January 29, 2023, approximately $106 million remained available under the June 2021 program and approximately $375 million remained available under the September 2021 program. We repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at a cost of $65 million in 2022. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” for additional information.
As of January 29, 2023, we had $578 million of short-term borrowings due within one year, none of which was comprised of commercial paper borrowings. As of January 29, 2023, we issued $29 million of standby letters of credit. On September 27, 2021, we entered into a committed revolving credit facility totaling $1.85 billion scheduled to mature on September 27, 2026. The facility remained unused at January 29, 2023, except for $1 million of standby letters of credit that we issued under it. The facility contains customary covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the credit facility) of not less than 3.25:1.00, measured quarterly, and customary events of default for credit facilities of this type. Loans under this facility will bear interest at the rates specified in the facility, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other customary conditions. The facility supports our commercial paper program and other general corporate purposes. We expect to continue to access the commercial paper markets, bank credit lines and utilize cash flows from operations to support our short-term liquidity requirements. 31
On November 15, 2022, we entered into a delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the DDTL Credit Agreement) totaling up to $500 million scheduled to mature on November 15, 2025. Loans under the DDTL Credit Agreement will bear interest at the rates specified in the DDTL Credit Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The DDTL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the DDTL Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.25:1.00, and events of default for credit facilities of this type. We anticipate using $500 million of the proceeds of the loans under the DDTL Credit Agreement to refinance our existing $566 million Notes with a maturity date of March 15, 2023. We are in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facilities and debt securities. In September 2020, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration statement, we may issue debt securities from time to time, depending on market conditions. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022 (2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K). The accounting policies we used in preparing these financial statements are substantially consistent with those we applied in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our significant accounting estimates are described in Management’s Discussion and Analysis included in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10‑K. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recent accounting pronouncements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Report contains "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding our future results of operations, economic performance, financial condition and achievements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "pursue," "strategy," "target," "will" and similar expressions. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, and may reflect anticipated cost savings or implementation of our strategic plan. These statements reflect our current plans and expectations and are based on information currently available to us. They rely on several assumptions regarding future events and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. We wish to caution the reader that the following important factors and those important factors described in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, or in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, could affect our actual results and could cause such results to vary materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us: • the risks related to the availability of, and cost inflation in, supply chain inputs, including labor, raw materials, commodities, packaging and transportation; • the impacts of, and associated responses to the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, suppliers, customers, consumers and employees; • our ability to execute on and realize the expected benefits from our strategy, including growing sales in snacks and growing/maintaining our market share position in soup; • the impact of strong competitive responses to our efforts to leverage brand power with product innovation, promotional programs and new advertising; • the risks associated with trade and consumer acceptance of product improvements, shelving initiatives, new products and pricing and promotional strategies; • our ability to realize projected cost savings and benefits from cost savings initiatives and the integration of recent acquisitions; • disruptions in or inefficiencies to our supply chain and/or operations; • risks related to the effectiveness of our hedging activities and our ability to respond to volatility in commodity prices; 32
• our ability to manage changes to our organizational structure and/or business processes, including selling, distribution, manufacturing and information management systems or processes; • changes in consumer demand for our products and favorable perception of our brands; • changing inventory management practices by certain of our key customers; • a changing customer landscape, with value and e-commerce retailers expanding their market presence, while certain of our key customers maintain significance to our business; • product quality and safety issues, including recalls and product liabilities; • the possible disruption to the independent contractor distribution models used by certain of our businesses, including as a result of litigation or regulatory actions affecting their independent contractor classification; • the uncertainties of litigation and regulatory actions against us; • the costs, disruption and diversion of management's attention associated with activist investors; • a disruption, failure or security breach of our or our vendors' information technology systems, including ransomware attacks; • impairment to goodwill or other intangible assets; • our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; • increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plans; • our ability to attract and retain key talent; • goals and initiatives related to, and the impacts of, climate change, including from weather-related events; • negative changes and volatility in financial and credit markets, deteriorating economic conditions and other external factors, including changes in laws and regulations; and • unforeseen business disruptions or other impacts due to political instability, civil disobedience, terrorism, armed hostilities (including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, other pandemics or other calamities. This discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact our outlook. We disclaim any obligation or intent to update forward-looking statements made by us in order to reflect new information, events or circumstances after the date they are made. Item 3.
