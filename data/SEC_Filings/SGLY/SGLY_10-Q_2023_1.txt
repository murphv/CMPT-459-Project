amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
Such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements regarding our projected growth, trends and strategies, future
operating and financial results, financial expectations and current business indicators are based upon current information and expectations
and are subject to change based on factors beyond our control. Forward-looking statements typically are identified by the use of terms
such as “look,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “might,” “believe,” “plan,”
“expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements are
expressed differently. The accuracy of such statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties we face that could
cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including but not limited to the following:
●
our ability to timely and properly deliver our services;
●
our dependence on a limited number of major customers and suppliers;
●
our ability to resume our business of sales of crypto mining machines and to expand our operations after the conclusion of the investigation;
●
current and future political and economic factors in the United States and China and the relationship between the two countries;
●
our ability to explore and enter into new business opportunities and the acceptance in the marketplace of our new lines of business;
●
unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors which may result in cancellations or reductions in the need for our services;
●
the demand for warehouse, shipping and logistics services;
●
the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
●
possible disruptions in commercial activities caused by events such as natural disasters, health epidemics, terrorist activity and armed conflict;
●
our ability to identify and successfully execute cost control initiatives;
●
the impact of quotas, tariffs or safeguards on our customer products that we service;
●
our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management team members and skilled personnel;
●
relevant governmental policies and regulations relating to our businesses and industries;
●
developments in, or changes to, laws, regulations, governmental policies, incentives and taxation affecting our operations;
●
our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of our employees, agents or business partners; and
●
the outcome of litigation or investigation in which we are involved is unpredictable, and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the forward-looking
statements. Nonetheless, the Company reserves the right to make such updates from time to time by press release, periodic report or other
method of public disclosure without the need for specific reference to this Report. No such update shall be deemed to indicate that other
statements not addressed by such update remain correct or create an obligation to provide any other updates.

SINGULARITY FUTURE TECHNOLOGY LTD. AND SUBSIDIAIRES
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements
For the Six Months ended December 31, 2022
N ote
1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS
The Company is a global
logistics integrated solution provider that was founded in the United States in 2001. On September 18, 2007, the Company amended its Articles
of Incorporation and Bylaws to merge into a new corporation, Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd. in Virginia. The Company primarily focuses
on providing logistics and support to businesses in the Peoples’ Republic of China (“PRC”)  and the United States.
On January 3, 2022, the Company changed its corporate name from Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd. to Singularity Future Technology Ltd.
to reflect its expanded operations into the digital assets business.
The
Company conducted its business primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the PRC (including Hong Kong) and
the United States, where the majority of its clients are located. As of December 31, 2022, the Company operated in two segments: (1)
freight logistics services, which were operated by its subsidiaries in both the United States and PRC, and (2) the sale of crypto-mining
machines, which were operated by its subsidiaries in the United States.
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
starting from late January 2020 in the PRC has spread rapidly to many parts of the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization
declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic and has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of stores and business
facilities in China and the U.S. Given the rapidly expanding nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, and because substantially all of the Company’s
business operations and its workforce are concentrated in China and the U.S., the Company’s business, results of operations, and
financial condition have been adversely affected. In early December 2022, Chinese government eased the strict control measure for COVID-19,
which has led to surge in increased infections and disruption in our business operations. Any future impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s
China operation results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration
and resurgence of COVID-19 variants and the actions taken by government authorities to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, almost all
of which are beyond our control.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s subsidiaries
included the following:

Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“US
GAAP”) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of its
subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Prior to December
31, 2021, Sino-China was considered a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”), with the Company as the primary beneficiary. The
Company, through Trans Pacific Beijing, entered into certain agreements with Sino-Global Shipping Agency Ltd. (“Sino-China”),
pursuant to which the Company received
90 % of Sino-China’s net income.
As a VIE, Sino-China’s revenues were included
in the Company’s total revenues, and any income/loss from operations was consolidated with that of the Company. Because of contractual
arrangements between the Company and Sino-China, the Company had a pecuniary interest in Sino-China that required consolidation of the
financial statements of the Company and Sino-China.
7
The Company has consolidated Sino-China’s
operating results in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810-10, “Consolidation”. The
agency relationship between the Company and Sino-China and its branches was governed by a series of contractual arrangements pursuant
to which the Company had substantial control over Sino-China. Management makes ongoing reassessments of whether the Company remains the
primary beneficiary of Sino-China. On December 31, 2021, the Company entered into a series of agreements to terminate its VIE structure
and deconsolidated its formerly controlled entity Sino-China.
(b) Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and
establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level 1 — Observable inputs such as unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
Level 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices
that are observable for the asset or liability in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets
that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market
data.
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that reflect
management’s assumptions based on the best available information.
The carrying value of accounts receivable, other
receivables, other current assets, and current liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
(c) Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of the Company’s unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates are adjusted to reflect actual experience when
necessary. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Company’s unaudited condense consolidated financial statements include
revenue recognition, fair value of stock-based compensation, cost of revenues, allowance for credit losses, impairment loss, deferred
income taxes, income tax expense and the useful lives of property and equipment. The inputs into the Company’s judgments and estimates
consider the economic implications of COVID-19 on the Company’s critical and significant accounting estimates. Since the use of
estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.
(d) Translation of Foreign Currency
The accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries
are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”).
The Company’s functional currency is the U.S. dollar (“USD”) while its subsidiaries in the PRC, including Trans Pacific
Beijing and Trans Pacific Shanghai report their financial positions and results of operations in Renminbi (“RMB”), its subsidiary
Sino-Global Shipping (HK), Ltd. reports its financial positions and results of operations in Hong Kong dollar (“HKD”). The
accompanying consolidated unaudited condensed financial statements are presented in USD. Foreign currency transactions are translated
into USD using the fixed exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction. Generally, foreign exchange gains and losses resulting
from the settlement of such transactions are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company translates the foreign
currency financial statements in accordance with ASC 830-10, “Foreign Currency Matters”. Assets and liabilities are translated
at current exchange rates quoted by the People’s Bank of China at the balance sheets’ dates and revenues and expenses are
translated at average exchange rates in effect during the year. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as other comprehensive
loss and accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity of the Company, and also included in non-controlling interests.
8
The exchange
rates as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:

(e) Cash
Cash consists of cash on hand and cash in bank
which are unrestricted as to withdrawal or use. The Company maintains cash with various financial institutions mainly in the PRC, Australia,
Hong Kong and the U.S. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, cash balances of $ 86,621
and $ 143,044 , respectively, were maintained
at financial institutions in the PRC.
None
of these balances are not covered by insurance as the deposit insurance system in China only
insured each depositor at one bank for a maximum of approximately $ 70,000
(RMB
500,000 ). As of, December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, cash
balances of $ 35,978,756
and $ 55,636,636 , respectively, were maintained at U.S. financial institutions. $ 34,637,312
and $ 53,869,575
of
these balances are not covered by insurance, as each U.S. account was insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other programs
subject to $ 250,000
limitations. The Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board pays compensation up to a limit of HKD
500,000
(approximately
$ 64,000 ) if the bank with which an individual/a company holds its eligible deposit fails. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, cash
balances of $ 2,289
and $ 51,701 , respectively, were maintained at financial institutions in Hong Kong and were insured by the Hong Kong
Deposit Protection Board. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, cash balances of
nil
and $ 192 , respectively, were maintained at Australia
financial institutions, and were insured as the Australian government guarantees deposits up to AUD
250,000
(approximately $ 172,000 ).
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, amount of deposits the Company had covered by insurance amounted to $ 1,430,354
and $ 1,961,997 ,
respectively.
(f) Cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrencies, mainly bitcoin, are included
in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Cryptocurrencies purchased are recorded at cost. Fair value of the
cryptocurrency award received is determined using the quoted price of the related cryptocurrency at the time of receipt.
Cryptocurrencies held are accounted for as intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually,
or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived
asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the
cryptocurrency at the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a
qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more
likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is
required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost
basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.
9
(g) Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses
Accounts receivable are presented at net realizable
value. The Company maintains allowances for credit losses. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general
and specific allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual receivable balances. In evaluating the collectability
of individual receivable balances, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balances, customers’ historical
payment history, their current credit-worthiness and current economic trends. The estimate of expected credit losses is based on information
about past events, current economic conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions that affect collectability.
Receivables are
generally considered past due after 180 days. The Company reserves 25%-50% of the customers balance aged between 181 days to 1 year, 50%-100%
of the customers balance over 1 year and 100% of the customers balance over 2 years. Accounts receivable are written off against the allowances
only after exhaustive collection efforts.
Other receivables represent mainly customer advances,
prepaid employee insurance and welfare benefits, which will be subsequently deducted from the employee payroll, project advances as well
as office lease deposits. Management reviews its receivables on a regular basis to determine if the credit loss is adequate, and adjusts
the allowance when necessary. The estimate of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, current economic conditions,
and forecasts of future economic conditions that affect collectability. Delinquent account balances are written-off against allowance
for credit losses after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable. Other receivables are written off
against the allowances only after exhaustive collection efforts.
(h) Property and Equipment, net
Property and equipment are stated at historical
cost less accumulated depreciation. Historical cost comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the assets
to its working condition and location for its intended use. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated
useful lives:
Buildings
20
years
Motor vehicles
3 - 10
years
Computer and office equipment
1 - 5
years
Furniture and fixtures
3 - 5
years
System software
5
years
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of lease term or useful lives
Mining equipment
3
years
The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered
impaired by the Company when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is less than its carrying value. If impairment is
identified, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair
value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or based on independent
appraisals. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no impairment were recorded, respectively.
(i) Investments in unconsolidated entity
Entities in which the Company has the ability
to exercise significant influence, but does not have a controlling interest, are accounted for using the equity method. Significant influence
is generally considered to exist when the Company has voting shares representing
20 % to
50 %, and other factors, such as representation
on the board of directors, voting rights and the impact of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method
of accounting is appropriate. Under this method of accounting, the Company records its proportionate share of the net earnings or losses
of equity method investees and a corresponding increase or decrease to the investment balances. Dividends received from the equity method
investments are recorded as reductions in the cost of such investments. The Company generally considers an ownership interest of
20 % or
higher to represent significant influence. The Company accounts for the investments in entities over which it has neither control nor
significant influence, and no readily determinable fair value is available, using the investment cost minus any impairment, if necessary.
10
Investments are evaluated for impairment when
facts or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the long-term investment is less than its carrying value. An impairment loss is
recognized when a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company reviews several factors to determine whether
a loss is other-than-temporary. These factors include, but are not limited to, the: (i) nature of the investment; (ii) cause and duration
of the impairment; (iii) extent to which fair value is less than cost; (iv) financial condition and near term prospects of the investment;
and (v) ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. On January 10,
2020, the Company entered into a cooperation agreement with Mr. Shanming Liang, a shareholder of the Company, to set up a joint venture
in New York named LSM Trading Ltd. (“LSM”) in which the Company holds a
40 % equity interest. Mr. Shanming Liang subsequently
transferred his shares to Guanxi Golden Bridge Industry Group Co., Ltd in October 2021. For the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company
invested $ 210,000
and recorded $ 47,181
investment loss. The joint venture has not started its operations due to COVID-19 and substantially
all of the Company’s investment was deposited in bank account with LSM and LSM has only incurred some administrative expenses. The
Company recorded $ 31,844
and $ 34,458
investment loss for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. No events have occurred
that indicated other-than-temporary impairment existed for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022.
(j) Convertible notes
The Company evaluates its convertible notes to
determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives. The result of this accounting treatment
is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is recorded at fair value each reporting period and recorded as a liability. In the
event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statements of operations as other income
or expense.
(k) Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue which represents
the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled
in such exchange. The Company identifies contractual performance obligations and determines whether revenue should be recognized at a
point in time or over time, based on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer.
The Company uses a five-step model to recognize
revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires the Company to (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify
the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that
it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations
in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation.
For the Company’s freight logistic, the
Company provided transportation services which includes mainly shipping services. The Company derived transportation revenue from sales
contracts with its customers with revenues being recognized upon performance of services. Sales price to the customer was fixed upon acceptance
of the sales contract and there was no separate sales rebate, discount, or other incentive. The Company’s revenues were recognized
at a point in time after all performance obligations were satisfied
For the
Company’s warehouse services, which are included in the
freight logistic services,
the
Company’s contracts provide the customer an integrated service that includes two or more services, including but not limited to
warehousing, collection, first-mile delivery, drop shipping, customs clearance packaging, etc. Accordingly, the Company generally identifies
one performance obligation in its contracts, which is a series of distinct services that remain substantially the same over time and possess
the same pattern of transfer. Revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided under the terms of the Company’s
contractual relationships with its clients.
Accordingly,
the Company generally identifies one performance obligation in its contracts, which is a series of distinct services that remain substantially
the same over time and possess the same pattern of transfer. Revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided under
the terms of the Company’s contractual relationships with its clients.
11
The transaction
price is based on the amount specified in the contract with the customer and contains fixed and variable consideration. In general, the
fixed consideration in a contract represents facility and equipment costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation and is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. The variable consideration is comprised of cost reimbursement determined based
on the costs
incurred. Revenue relating to variable pricing is estimated and included in the consideration if it is probable that
a significant revenue reversal will not occur in the future. The estimate of variable consideration is determined by the expected value
or most likely amount method and factors in current, past and forecasted experience with the customer. Customers are billed based on terms
specified in the revenue contract and they pay us according to approved payment terms.
Revenue for the above services is recognized on
a gross basis when the Company controls the services as it has the obligation to (i) provide all services (ii) bear any inventory risk
for warehouse services. In addition, the Company has control to set its selling price to ensure it would generate profit for the services.
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the
Company engaged in resale of cryptocurrency mining equipment.
On January 10, 2022, the Company’s joint
venture, Thor Miner, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with SOS Information Technology New York Inc. (the “Buyer”).
Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, Thor Miner agreed to sell and the Buyer agreed to purchase certain cryptocurrency mining
equipment.
The Company’s performance obligation is
to deliver products according to contract specifications. The Company recognizes product revenue at a point in time when the control of
products or services are transferred to customers. To distinguish a promise to provide products from a promise to facilitate the sale
from a third party, the Company considers the guidance of control in ASC 606-10-55-37A and the indicators in 606-10-55-39. The Company
considers this guidance in conjunction with the terms in the Company’s arrangements with both suppliers and customers.
In general, revenue is recognized on a gross basis
when the Company controls the products as it has the obligation to (i) fulfill the products delivery and custom clearance (ii) bear any
inventory risk as legal owners. In addition, when establishing the selling prices for delivery of the resale products, the Company has
control to set its selling price to ensure it would generate profit for the products delivery arrangements. If the Company is not responsible
for provision of product and does not bear inventory risk, the Company recorded revenue on a net basis.
For the three and six months ended December 31,
2022, the Company recognized the sale of cryptocurrency mining equipment based on net basis as the manufacturer of the products are responsible
for shipping and custom clearing for the products.
Contract balances
The Company records receivables related to revenue
when the Company has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment.
Deferred revenue consists primarily of customer
billings made in advance of performance obligations being satisfied and revenue being recognized. Contract balance amounted to $ 204,442
and $ 72,095
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(l) Leases
The Company adopted FASB ASU 2016-02, “Leases”
(Topic 842) for the year ended June 30, 2020, and elected the practical expedients that does not require us to reassess: (1) whether any
expired or existing contracts are, or contain, leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (3) initial direct
costs for any expired or existing leases. For lease terms of twelve months or fewer, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy
election not to recognize lease assets and liabilities. The Company also adopted the practical expedient that allows lessees to treat
the lease and non-lease components of a lease as a single lease component. Upon adoption, the Company recognized right of use (“ROU”)
assets and same amount of lease liabilities based on the present value of the future minimum rental payments of leases, using an incremental
borrowing rate of
7 % based on the duration of lease terms.
Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities
are recognized at the adoption date or the commencement date, whichever is earlier, based on the present value of lease payments over
the lease term. Since the implicit rate for the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company use its incremental borrowing
rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing
rate is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments,
in a similar economic environment and over a similar term.
Lease terms used to calculate the present value
of lease payments generally do not include any options to extend, renew, or terminate the lease, as the Company does not have reasonable
certainty at lease inception that these options will be exercised. The Company generally considers the economic life of its operating
lease ROU assets to be comparable to the useful life of similar owned assets. The Company has elected the short-term lease exception,
therefore operating lease ROU assets and liabilities do not include leases with a lease term of twelve months or less. Its leases generally
do not provide a residual guarantee. The operating lease ROU asset also excludes lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.
The Company reviews the impairment of its ROU
assets consistent with the approach applied for its other long-lived assets. The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived
assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment
of possible impairment is based on its ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax
cash flows of the related operations. The Company has elected to include the carrying amount of operating lease liabilities in any tested
asset group and include the associated operating lease payments in the undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows.
(m) Taxation
Because the Company and its subsidiaries and Sino-China
were incorporated in different jurisdictions, they file separate income tax returns. The Company uses the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Deferred taxes, if any, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the asset will not be utilized
in the future.
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an
uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities,
based on the technical merits of the position. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits
as income tax expense. The Company had no uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.
13
Income tax returns for the years prior to 2018
are no longer subject to examination by U.S. tax authorities.
PRC Enterprise Income Tax
PRC enterprise income tax is calculated based
on taxable income determined under the PRC Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“PRC GAAP”) at
25 %. Sino-China and Trans
Pacific Beijing were incorporated in the PRC and are subject to the Enterprise Income Tax Laws of the PRC.
PRC Value Added Taxes and Surcharges
The Company is subject to value added tax (“VAT”).
Revenue from services provided by the Company’s PRC subsidiaries are subject to VAT at rates ranging from
9 % to
13 %. Entities that
are VAT general taxpayers are allowed to offset qualified VAT paid to suppliers against their VAT liability. Net VAT liability is recorded
in taxes payable on the consolidated balance sheets.
In addition, under the PRC regulations, the Company’s
PRC subsidiaries and VIE are required to pay city construction tax ( 7 %) and education surcharges ( 3 %) based on the net VAT payments.
(n) Earnings (loss) per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by
dividing net income (loss) attributable to holders of common stock of the Company by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
of the Company outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur
if securities or other contracts to issue common stock of the Company were exercised or converted into common stock of the Company. Common
stock equivalents are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share if their effects would be anti-dilutive.
For the three and six months ended December 31,
2022 and 2021, there was no dilutive effect of potential shares of common stock of the Company because the Company generated net loss.
(o) Comprehensive Income (Loss)
The Company reports comprehensive income (loss)
in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) which establishes
standards for reporting comprehensive income (loss) and its component in financial statements. Other comprehensive income (loss) refers
to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under US GAAP are recorded as an element of stockholders’ equity but are excluded from
net income. Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of a foreign currency translation adjustment resulting from the Company not using
the U.S. dollar as its functional currencies.
(p) Stock-based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
awards to employees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation”, which requires that
stock-based payment transactions with employees be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instrument issued and recognized
as compensation expense over the requisite service period. The Company records stock-based compensation expense at fair value on the grant
date and recognizes the expense over the employee’s requisite service period.
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
awards to non-employees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 amended by ASU 2018-07. Under FASB ASC Topic 718, stock compensation granted
to non-employees has been determined as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of equity instrument issued, whichever
is more reliably measured and is recognized as an expense as the goods or services are received.
Valuations of stock-based compensation are based
upon highly subjective assumptions about the future, including stock price volatility and exercise patterns. The fair value of share-based
payment awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility
of the Company’s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations. The expected term
of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within
the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.

(q) Risks and Uncertainties
The Company’s business, financial position
and results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic, health and legal environments in the PRC, as well as by the general
state of the PRC economy. The Company’s operations in the PRC are subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically
associated with companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic,
health and legal environments and foreign currency exchange. The Company’s results may be adversely affected by changes in the political,
regulatory and social conditions in the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies or interpretations with respect to laws and regulations,
anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion, remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared
the COVID-19 as a pandemic. Given the rapidly expanding nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, and because substantially all of the Company’s
business operations and the workforce are concentrated in China and United States, the Company’s business, results of operations,
and financial condition have been adversely affected for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. The situation remains highly
uncertain for any further outbreak or resurgence of the COVID-19. It is therefore difficult for the Company to estimate the impact on
the business or operating results that might be adversely affected by any further outbreak or resurgence of COVID-19.
(r) Disposal of subsidiaries and VIE
On December 31, 2021, the Company entered into
a series of agreements to terminate its VIE structure and deconsolidated its formerly controlled entity Sino-Global Shipping Agency Ltd.
(“Sino-China”). The Company controlled Sino-China through its wholly owned subsidiary Trans Pacific Beijing. The Company
made the decision to dissolve the VIE structure and Sino-China because Sino-China has no active operations and the Company wanted to remove
any potential risks associated with any VIE structures. In addition, the Company dissolved its subsidiary Sino-Global Shipping LA, Inc.
On March 14, 2022, the company discontinued its subsidiary Sino-Global Shipping Canada, Inc., no gain or loss was recognized in the deconsolidation.
Since the disposal did not represent any strategic
change of the Company’s operation, the disposal was not presented as discontinued operations.
Net assets of the entities disposed and loss on
disposal was as follows:

(s) Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, which
is an update to ASU Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments, which introduced the expected credit losses methodology for the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured
at amortized cost basis, replacing the previous incurred loss methodology. The amendments in Update 2016-13 added Topic 326, Financial
Instruments—Credit Losses, and made several consequential amendments to the Codification. Update 2016-13 also modified the accounting
for available-for-sale debt securities, which must be individually assessed for credit losses when fair value is less than the amortized
cost basis, in accordance with Subtopic 326-30, Financial Instruments— Credit Losses—Available-for-Sale Debt Securities. The
amendments in this ASU address those stakeholders’ concerns by providing an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option for
certain financial assets previously measured at amortized cost basis. For those entities, the targeted transition relief will increase
comparability of financial statement information by providing an option to align measurement methodologies for similar financial assets.
Furthermore, the targeted transition relief also may reduce the costs for some entities to comply with the amendments in Update 2016-13
while still providing financial statement users with decision-useful information. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, which
to update the effective date of ASU No. 2016-13 for private companies, not-for-profit organizations and certain smaller reporting companies
applying for credit losses standard. The new effective date for these preparers is for fiscal years beginning after July 1, 2023, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has not early adopted this update and it will become effective on July 1, 2023
assuming the Company will remain eligible to be smaller reporting company. The adoption did not have material impact on the Company’s
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
The Company does not believe other recently issued
but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.

Note 11. CONVERTIBLE NOTES
On December 19, 2021,
the Company issued two Senior Convertible Notes (the “Convertible Notes”) to two non-U.S. investors for an aggregate purchase
price of $ 10,000,000 .
The Convertible Notes
bear an interest at
5 % annually and may be converted into shares of the Company’s common stock, no par value per share at a conversion
price of $ 3.76
per share, the closing price of the common stock on December 17, 2021. The Convertible Notes are unsecured senior obligations
of the Company, and the maturity date of the Convertible Notes is December 18, 2023. The Company may repay any portion of the outstanding
principal, accrued and unpaid interest, without penalty for early repayment. The Company may make any repayment of principal and interest
in (a) cash, (b) common stock at the conversion price or (c) a combination of cash or common stock at the conversion price.
The investors may convert
any conversion amount into common stock on any date beginning on June 19, 2022.
The Company evaluated the convertible notes agreement
under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”) amended by ASU 2020-06. ASC 815 generally requires the analysis embedded
terms and features that have characteristics of derivatives to be evaluated for bifurcation and separate accounting in instances where
their economic risks and characteristics are not clearly and closely related to the risks of the host contract. Based on terms of the
convertible notes agreements, the Company’s notes are convertible for a fixed number of shares and do not require the Company to
net settle. None of the embedded terms required bifurcation and liability classification.
On March 8, 2022, the
Company issued amended and restated the terms of the notes and issued the Amended and Restated Senior Convertible Notes (the “Amended
and Restated Convertible Notes”) to the investors to change the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to an aggregate principal
amount of $ 5,000,000 . There other terms of the notes remained unchanged.
The terms of the Amended
and Restated Convertible Notes are the same as that of the original Convertible Notes, except for the reduced principal amount and the
waiver of interest for the $5,000,000 payment made on March 8, 2022.
For the three and six
months ended December 31, 2022, interest expenses related to the aforementioned convertible notes amounted to $ 61,944
and $ 123,587 , respectively.

Note 12. LEASES
The Company determines if a contract contains
a lease at inception which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to and the agreement creates enforceable rights and
obligations. US GAAP requires that the Company’s leases be evaluated and classified as operating or finance leases for financial
reporting purposes. The classification evaluation begins at the commencement date and the lease term used in the evaluation includes the
non-cancellable period for which the Company has the right to use the underlying asset, together with renewal option periods when the
exercise of the renewal option is reasonably certain and failure to exercise such option which result in an economic penalty. All of the
Company’s leases are classified as operating leases.
The Company has several lease agreements with
lease terms ranging from
two
to
five
years . As of December 31, 2022, ROU assets and lease liabilities amounted to $ 478,547
and $ 1,044,670
(including $ 448,252
from lease liabilities current portion and $ 596,418
from lease liabilities non-current portion), respectively and
weighted average discount rate was approximately
10.89 %.

any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The leases generally do not contain options to extend at the
time of expiration and the weighted average remaining lease terms are
3.06
years.

Note 13. EQUITY
Stock issuances:

the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with non-U.S. investors and accredited
investors pursuant to which the Company sold to the investors, and the investors agreed to purchase from the Company, an aggregate of
3,228,807
shares of common stock, no par value, and warrants to purchase
4,843,210
shares. The purchase price for each share of common
stock and one and a half warrants is $ 3.26 , and the exercise price per warrant is $ 4.00 . The Company received net proceed of $ 10,525,819
and issued

shares and
4,843,210
warrants. In connection with the issuance, the Company issued

2022 and ending on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on December 13, 2026 but not thereafter; provided, however, that the total
number of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, multiplied by the NASDAQ official closing bid price of the
common stock shall equal or exceed $ 150,000,000
for a
three
consecutive
month
period prior to an exercise.

as equity since they qualify for exception from derivative accounting as they are considered to be indexed to the Company’s own
stock and require net share settlement. The fair value of the warrants was recorded as additional paid-in capital from common stock
On January 6, 2022, the
Company entered into Warrant Purchase Agreements with certain warrant holders (the “Sellers”) pursuant to which the Company

February 10, 2021, and March 14, 2018. The purchase price for each Warrant is $ 2.00 . Following announcement of the Warrant Purchase Agreements
on January 6, 2022, the Company agreed to repurchase an additional
103,200
warrants from other Sellers on the same terms as the previously
announced Warrant Purchase Agreements. The aggregate number of warrants repurchased under the Warrant Purchase Agreements was
3,974,000 .
On January 7, 2022, the Company wired the purchase
price to each Seller. Each Seller has agreed to deliver the Warrant to the Company for cancellation as soon as practicable following the
closing date, but in no event later than January 13, 2022. The Warrants are deemed cancelled upon the receipt by the Sellers of the purchase
price.

Defendants”), Lei Cao, Yang Jie, John F. Levy, Tieliang Liu, Tuo Pan, Shi Qiu, Jing Shan, and Heng Wang (jointly referred to as
the “Individual Defendants”) (collectively, the Individual Defendants and the Corporate Defendants are the “Defendants”).
SOSNY and Thor Miner entered into a January 10, 2022 Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “PSA”) for the purchase of $200,000,000
in crypto mining rigs, which SOSNY claims was breached by the Defendants.
SOSNY and Defendants entered into a certain settlement
agreement and general mutual release with an Effective Date of December 28, 2022 (“Settlement Agreement”). Pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement, Thor Miner agreed to pay a sum of thirteen million in U.S. dollars ($ 13,000,000 ) (the “Settlement Payment”)
to SOSNY in exchange for SOSNY dismissing the lawsuit with prejudice as to the settling Defendants and without prejudice as to all others.
The full Settlement Payment was received by SOSNY on December 28, 2022. SOSNY dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice against Singularity
(and other Defendants) on December 28, 2022.
Singularity and Thor Miner further covenanted
and agreed that if they receive additional funds from HighSharp (Shenzhen Gaorui) Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. (“HighSharp”)
related to the PSA, they will promptly transfer such funds to SOSNY in an amount not to exceed forty million, five hundred sixty thousand,
five hundred sixty-nine dollars ($ 40,560,569.00 ) (which is the total amount paid by SOSNY pursuant to the PSA less the price of the machines
actually received by SOSNY pursuant to the PSA). The Settlement Payment and any payments subsequently received by SOSNY from HighSharp
shall be deducted from the total amount of forty million, five hundred sixty thousand, five hundred sixty-nine dollars ($ 40,560,569.00 )
previously paid by, and now due and owing to SOSNY. In further consideration of the Settlement Agreement, Thor Miner agreed to execute
and provide to SOSNY, within seven (7) business days after SOSNY’s receipt of the Settlement Payment, an assignment of all claims
it may have against HighSharp or otherwise to the proceeds of the PSA. See Note 19 for further details.

The Company’s operations in the U.S. incurred
a cumulative U.S. federal net operation losses (“NOL”) of approximately $ 22,000,000
as of June 30, 2022, which may reduce
future federal taxable income. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, approximately $ 4,100,000
and $ 7,300,000
of NOL
was generated and the tax benefit derived from such NOL was approximately $ 861,000
and $ 1,500,000 .
As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s
cumulative NOL amounted to approximately $29,400,000, which may reduce future federal taxable income, of which approximately $1,400,000
will expire in 2037 and the remaining balance carried forward indefinitely .
The Company’s operations in China incurred
a cumulative NOL of approximately $ 1,333,000
as of June 30, 2022 which was mainly from net loss. During the three and six months ended
December 31, 2022, additional NOL of approximately $ 130,000
and $ 245,000
was generated.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s cumulative
NOL amounted to approximately $5,567,000 which may reduce future taxable income which will expire by 2026.
The Company periodically evaluates the likelihood
of the realization of deferred tax assets (“DTA”) and reduces the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets by a valuation
allowance to the extent it believes a portion will not be realized. Management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that
could affect the Company’s future realization of deferred tax assets including its recent cumulative earnings experience, expectation
of future income, the carry forward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The Company determined that
it is more likely than not its deferred tax assets could not be realized due to uncertainty on future earnings as a result of the company’s
reorganization and venture into new businesses . The Company provided a
100 % allowance for its DTA as of December 31, 2022. The net
increase in valuation for the three months and six months ended December 31, 2022 amounted to approximately $ 894,000
and $ 1,464,000 , based
on management’s reassessment of the amount of the Company’s deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of the
Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
and the related notes included elsewhere in the report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as
a result of various factors.
Overview
We previously focused on providing customized
freight logistic services, but starting in 2017, we began exploring new opportunities to expand our business and generate more revenue.
These opportunities ranged from complementary businesses to other new service and product initiatives. In the fiscal years 2021 and 2022,
while we continued to provide our freight logistic business, we expanded our services to include warehousing services provided by our
US subsidiary Brilliant Warehouse Service Inc. On January 3, 2022, we changed our corporate name to Singularity Future Technology Ltd.
to align with our entry into the digital assets business through our U.S. subsidiaries. During 2022, we were engaged in purchases and
sales of cryptocurrency mining machines through our U.S. subsidiary.
As of December 31,
2022, the Company operated
in two operating segments, including (1) freight logistics
services; (2) the purchase and sale of crypto mining machines, through our subsidiary Thor Miner.
Recent Development
On January 10, 2022,
the Company’s joint venture, Thor Miner, entered into a Purchase Agreement with HighSharp. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Thor
Miner agreed to purchase certain cryptocurrency mining equipment. In January and April 2022, Thor Miner made total prepayment of $35,406,649
for the order. The Company also entered into sales contract with SOS information Technology New York Inc (“SOSNY”) which
specify the products to be delivered within 120 days from acceptance of contract and received deposit form SOSNY in the amount of $48,930,000.
The Company shipped
products of $1,325,520 for the year ended June 30, 2022 and $6,153,546 from July to December 2023. Due to production issue from
HighSharp, Thor Miner was not able to timely deliver the products to SOSNY according to contract and was sued by SOSNY for breach of
contract on December 9, 2022.
On December 22, 2022, the Company entered into
a settlement agreement SOSNY in which the Company will repay $13.0 million to SOSNY and terminate the previous agreements and balance
of the deposits. The Company also assigned to SOSNY the right for the deposit that Thor Miner has paid to HighSharp. The full settlement payment of $13 million was received by SOSNY on December 28, 2022. SOSNY dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice against
Singularity (and other defendants) on December 28, 2022.
Restatement of previously issued financial
statements
The Company discovered error in revenue recognition in its subsidiary
SGS NY during the audit for the three ended September 30, 2021 that $980,200 of revenue recognized in freight logistics did not meet revenue
recognition criteria for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
In addition, in connection with the Company’s

COVID-19
The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus (“COVID-19”)
starting from late January 2020 in the PRC has spread rapidly to many parts of the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization
declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Given the continually expanding nature of the COVID-19 pandemic in China and U.S., our business, results
of operations, and financial condition are still adversely affected. The situation remains highly uncertain for any further outbreak or
resurgence of COVID-19. It is therefore difficult for us to estimate the impact on our business or operating results that might be adversely
affected by any further outbreak or resurgence of COVID-19.
In early December 2022, the Chinese government
eased its strict control measures for COVID-19, which led to a surge in increased infections and disruptions in our business operations.
Any future impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s China operational results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments
and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and resurgence of COVID-19 variants and the actions taken by government authorities
to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control.
The impacts of COVID-19 on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following:
●
Our customers have been negatively impacted by the pandemic, which reduced their demand for freight logistics services. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, our companies revenue were down by approximately $0.4 million, or 27.1%. There were no material impact for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
● Due to travel restrictions between
US and China, our joint ventures were unable to start operation as planned which has slowed down our new business development.
●
Our sales of crypto mining machines were materially adversely affected
by COVID-19. Specifically, Crypto mining machine manufacturers have been impacted by the constrained supply of the semiconductors used
in the production of the highly specialized crypto mining machines; COVID-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent
supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in delayed shipments and additional expenses to expedite delivery; as a result, we were unable
to fulfil our customer orders on a timely basis, resulting cancellation of orders and partial refund of purchase price, as evident from
the settlement in SOSNY.

Revenues from Freight Logistics Services
Freight logistics services primarily consist of
cargo forwarding, brokerage, warehouse and other freight services. Revenues from freight logistics services was $1,255,411 for the three
months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $213,486, or approximately 20.5%, as compared to $1,041,925 for the same period in 2021
mainly due to the increase in our U.S. operations of our subsidiary Brilliant Warehouse for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Brilliant Warehouse was in the start-up stage for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and did not contribute significant revenue.
Revenues from Sales of Crypto Mining Machines
Our subsidiary,
Thor Miner entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with SOS Information Technology New York Inc. (the “Buyer”). Pursuant
to the Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell certain cryptocurrency mining hardware and other equipment. Since our vendor shipped the products
to the Buyer directly which we did not control the delivery and did not bear inventory risk, we recognized net revenue of $235,520. Gross
revenue and gross purchases
amounted to $2,213,888 and $1,978,368, respectively for the three
months ended December 31, 2022. The contract was terminated in December 2022.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Operating costs and expenses
increased by $1,481,176 or approximately 40.1%, from $3,695,991 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to $5,177,166 for the three
months ended December 31, 2022. This increase was mainly due to the increase in selling expenses, stock-based compensation, and general
and administrative expenses, which offset by decrease of cost of revenue as discussed below.

Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues for our freight logistics segment
mainly consisted primarily of freight costs to various freight carriers, cost of labor, warehouse rent and other overhead and sundry costs.
Cost of revenues for freight logistic segment was $1,311,137 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $286,246, or
approximately 27.9 %, as compared to $1,024,891 for the same period in 2021 as our revenue increased. The increase was mainly due to increase
in freight cost operations as our revenue increased.
Our gross margin was 12.1% and 1.6% for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Our freight logistic margin decreased from 1.6%
to (4.4)% from our PRC operations due to rising freight cost from carriers in PRC as we were not able to negotiate better pricing due
to lower volume than the previous year.
The overall increase in our margin
was due to the sales of crypto-mining machines that we started providing in 2022. We recognized this revenue on a net basis, thus increasing
the overall margin of our operations.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Operating costs and expenses increased by
$1,481,176 or approximately 40.1%, from $3,695,991 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to $5,177,166 for the three
months ended December 31, 2022. This increase was mainly due to the increase in general administrative expenses as discussed
below.
Selling Expenses
Our selling expenses consisted primarily of salaries
for our sales representatives. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we had $26,848 of selling expenses, as compared to $197,225
for the same period in 2021, which represents a decrease of $170,377 or approximately 86.4%. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease
in salaries as we reduced the salary of the freight logistics segment for our selling team under COVID-19 compared to the same period
of 2021.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and benefits, travel expenses for administration department, office expenses, regulatory filing and professional
service fees including audit, legal and IT consulting. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we had $3,743,458 of general and
administrative expenses, as compared to $2,151,431 for the same period in 2021, representing an increase of $ 1,592,027, or approximately
74.0%. The increase was mainly due to the increase in salaries & wages and office related costs of approximately $0.5 million as we
hired more employees to our new subsidiaries such as Gorgeous Trading Ltd. and Brilliant Warehouse Service, Inc., and additional professional
fees of approximately $2.0 million which are mainly legal fees.
Impairment Loss of Cryptocurrencies
The Company recorded $13,280 and $50,127
impairment loss for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to recent price drop in bitcoin which the Company deemed a triggering
event for impairment testing.
Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation was $82,444 for the three
months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $294,556 or 78.1%, as compared to $377,000 for the same period in 2021 because
less stock compensation was granted in current period.
Other Expenses, Net
Total other expenses, net was $60,631 for
the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $30,750 or 102.9%, as compared to $29,881 for the same
period in 2021. The increase was mainly due to interest of our $5.0million convertible notes which we issued in December 2021.
35
Loss from disposal
of Subsidiaries and VIE
On December 31, 2021,
our wholly owned foreign subsidiary Trans Pacific Beijing entered into a series of agreements to terminate our VIE structure and terminate
the existence of our formerly controlled entity Sino-Global Shipping Agency Ltd. (“Sino-China”) since Sino-China has no active
operations. We controlled Sino-China through Trans Pacific Beijing. In addition, the Company dissolved its subsidiary Sino-Global Shipping
LA, Inc. Total loss from disposal was approximately $6.1 million mainly from write off of due from non-controlling interest of Sino-China.
Since the disposal did not represent any strategic change of the Company’s operation, the disposal was not presented as discontinued
operations.
Taxes
We recorded no income tax expense for both three
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
We have incurred a cumulative U.S. federal net
operating loss (“NOL”) of approximately $22,000,000 as of June 30, 2022, which may reduce future federal taxable income. The
NOL generated prior to the three months ended December 31, 2022 amounted to approximately $4,1000,000. The Tax benefit derived from this
NOL was approximately $861,000. As of December 31, 2022, our cumulative NOL amounted to approximately $29,400,000. This may reduce
our future federal taxable income, approximately $1,400,000 of which will expire in 2037. The remaining balance will be carried forward
indefinitely.
Our operations in China have incurred a cumulative
NOL of approximately $1,333,000 as of June 30, 2022, which was mainly from Sino -China which was disposed of during the three months ended
December 31, 2022. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 we generated an additional NOL of approximately $130,000. As of December
31, 2022, our PRC subsidiaries’ cumulative NOL amounted to approximately $5,567,000, which may reduce future taxable income and
will expire by 2026.
We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the
realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent it
believes a portion will not be realized. Management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect our future realization
of deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience, expectation of future income, the carry forward periods available
for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. We determined that it is more likely than not our deferred tax assets could not
be realized due to uncertainty on future earnings as a result of the company’s reorganization and venture into new businesses. We
provided a 100% allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022. The net decrease in valuation for the three months ended December
31, 2022 amounted to approximately $894,000 based on management’s reassessment of the amount of our deferred tax assets that are
more likely than not to be realized.
Net Loss
As a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss
of $3,746,867 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $8,815,563 for the same period in 2021. After the deduction of
non-controlling interest, net loss attributable to us was $3,732,496 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $8,760,575
for the same period in 2021. Comprehensive loss attributable to us was $3,738,793 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared
to $9,136,530 for the same period in 2021.
Comparison of the Six Months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021
Revenues
Revenues increased by
$854,200, or approximately 46.0 %, from $1,857,935 for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to $ 2,712,135 for the same period in 2022.
The increase was primarily due to increased revenue from our sale of crypto mining machines.

Revenues from Freight Logistics Services
Freight logistics services
primarily consist of cargo forwarding, brokerage and warehouse services. The revenues from freight logistics services were $1,979,570
for the six months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $121,635, or 6.5%, as compared to $1,857,935 for the same period in 2021. The
increase was mainly due to an increase of revenue from our U.S. subsidiary Brilliant Warehouse of approximately $0.6 million and decrease
in shipping revenue of approximately $0.1 million from our PRC operation due to a decrease in   demand from one major customer.
Revenues from Sales
of Crypto Mining Machines
For
the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, sale of crypto mining machines generated revenues of $732,565 and nil, respectively as
we entered into sales contract with SOSNY.
Our contract with the Buyer was terminated in December
2022.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Operating costs and expenses
decreased by $490,607 or 5.1%, from $9,677,029 for the six months ended December 31, 2021 to $ 9,186,422 for the six months ended December
31, 2022. This decrease was mainly due to the significant decrease in stock-based compensation, partially offset by the increase in general
and administrative expenses

Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consisted primarily of freight
costs to various freight carriers, the cost of labor, and other overhead and sundry costs. Cost of revenues was $2,056,764 for the six
months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $14,995, or approximately 0.7%, as compared to $2,071,759 for the same period in 2021.
Our freight logistic margin increased from (11.5)%
to (3.9)% mainly due to an improvement in Brilliant Warehouse’s efficiency as it generated more revenue.
38
The overall increase in our margin was due to
the sales of crypto-mining machines for the six months ended December 31, 2022. We recognized this revenue on a net basis, thus increasing
the overall margin of our operations.
Selling Expenses
Our selling expenses consisted primarily of salaries,
meals and entertainment and travel expenses for our sales representatives. For the six months ended December 31, 2021, we had $271,621
of selling expenses, as compared to $54,223 for the same period in 2022, which represents a decrease of $217,398 or approximately 80.0%.
The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in salaries and travel expenses for our freight logistics segment in the PRC due to the impact
of COVID-19 compared to the same period of 2021.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and benefits, travel expenses for administration department, office expenses, regulatory filing and professional
service fees including audit, legal and IT consulting. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, we had $6,723,704 of general and administrative
expenses, as compared to $4,118,000 for the same period in 2021, representing an increase of $2,605,704, or approximately 63.3%. The increase
was mainly due to the increase in employees, offices and other general and administrative expense approximately of $0.3 million as we
hired more employees and opened more office locations to expand our logistics services and additional professional fees of approximately
$3.6 million which are mainly legal fees due to professional fees paid to the Company’s special committee to investigate claims
of alleged fraud, misrepresentation, and inadequate disclosure related to the Company and certain of its management personnel raised in
the Hindenburg Report and other related matters.
Impairment Loss of Cryptocurrencies
The company recorded $14,801 and $50,127 impairment
loss for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to recent price drops in bitcoin, which the Company deemed
a triggering event for impairment testing.
Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation was $329,777 for the
six months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $2,974,623 or 90.0%, as compared to $3,304,400 for the same period in 2021, as we issued
less stock compensation to employees and directors.
Loss from Disposal of Subsidiaries and VIE
On December 31, 2021,
our wholly owned foreign subsidiary Trans Pacific Beijing entered into a series of agreements to terminate our VIE structure
and terminate the existence of our formerly controlled entity Sino-Global Shipping Agency Ltd. (“Sino-China”) since Sino-China
has no active operations. We controlled Sino-China through Trans Pacific Beijing. In addition, the Company dissolved its subsidiary Sino-Global
Shipping LA, Inc. Total loss from disposal was approximately $6.1 million, which was primarily due to a write off of due from the non-controlling
interest of Sino-China. This disposal was not presented as discontinued operations because it did not represent any strategic change of
the Company’s operations.
Taxation
We recorded income tax expenses of $103,426 and
nil for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
We have incurred a cumulative U.S. federal net
operating loss (“NOL”) of approximately $22,000,000 as of June 30, 2022, which may reduce future federal taxable income. The
NOL generated prior to the year ended June 30, 2017 amounted to approximately $1,400,000 will expire in 2037 and the remaining balance
carried forward indefinitely. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, approximately $7,300,000 of additional NOL was generated
and the tax benefit derived from such NOL was approximately $1,500,000.
Our operations in China have incurred a cumulative
a cumulative NOL of approximately $1,333,000 as of June 30, 2022, which may reduce future taxable income. During the six months ended
December 31, 2022, additional NOL of approximately $245,000 was generated. The NOL amounted to approximately $5,567,000 start expiring
from 2023 and the remaining balance of NOL will be expired by 2026.

We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the
realization of deferred tax assets, and reduces the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent
it believes a portion will not be realized. Management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect our future
realization of deferred tax assets including its recent cumulative earnings experience, expectation of future income, the carry forward
periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. We determined that it is more likely than not our deferred tax
assets could not be realized due to uncertainty on future earnings as a result of the deterioration of trade negotiation between the U.S.
and China. We provided a 100% allowance for its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022. The net decrease in valuation for the six
months ended December 31, 2022 amounted to approximately $1,464,000 based on management’s reassessment of the amount of our deferred
tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.
Net loss
As a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss
of $6,697,193 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $14,032,945 for the same period in 2021. After the deduction of
non-controlling interest, net loss attributable to the Company was $6,816,847 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to

In assessing the liquidity, we monitor and analyze
our cash on-hand and our operating and capital expenditure commitments. Our liquidity needs are to meet our working capital requirements,
operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. As of December 31, 2022, our working capital was approximately $26.8 million and
we had cash of approximately $36.1 million. We believe our current working capital
is sufficient to support our operations and debt obligations as they become due one year through the date of this report.
Operating Activities
Our net cash used
in operating activities was approximately $19.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The operating cash outflow for the

$6.8 million where we realized revenue from the sale of crypto mining equipment and decrease in refund payable  of $13.0 million
as a result of the settlement payment to SOSNY, offset by cash inflow consisting of advance to a related party supplier of approximately
$6.2 million
which we realized cost for sale of cryptocurrency equipment.
Our net cash used in operating activities was
approximately $5.6 million for six months ended December 31, 2021. The operating cash outflow for the six months ended December 31, 2021
was primarily attributable to our net loss of approximately $14.0 million, adjusted by non cash stock-based compensation of approximately
$3.3 million and loss on disposal of subsidiaries of approximately $6.1 million. We had an increase in cash outflow of other receivables
of approximately $1.7 million.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was
approximately $0.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 due to repayment of loan receivable of approximately $0.5 million
from Wang Qinggang, a related party and cash inflow of $90,000 from the sale of property and equipment and purchase of equipment of approximately $151,000.
Net cash used in investing activities was approximately
$2.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021 due to the acquisition of property and equipment of approximately $0.6 million,
investment of approximately $0.2 million to a joint venture named LSM Trading Ltd., in which we hold a 40% of equity interest. We loaned
Shanghai Baoyin Industrial Co., Ltd., a related party and made advance of approximately $1.5 million. The loan is unsecured and non-interest
bearing.
Financing Activities
We did not have any financing activities for the
six months ended December 31,2022.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion
and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and
estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to consolidated
financial statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”)
describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2022 Form 10-K.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the
Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of December 31, 2022,
the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of and with the participation of its management, including the Company’s
Chief Operating Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based
on the foregoing evaluation, the Chief Operating Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the applicable rules and forms due to ineffective internal controls over financial reporting that stemmed from the
following material weaknesses:
●
Lack of segregation of duties for accounting personnel who prepared and reviewed the journal entries in some of the subsidiaries within the consolidation, lack of supervision, coordination and communication of financial information between different entities within the Group;
● Lack of a full time U.S. GAAP
personnel in the accounting department to monitor and reconcile the recording of the transactions which led to error in revenue recognition
in previously issued financial statements;
●
Lack of resources with technical competency to address, review and record non-routine or complex transactions under U.S. GAAP;
●
Lack of management control reviews of the budget against actual with analysis of the variance with a precision that can be explained through the analysis of the accounts;
●
Lack of proper procedures in identifying and recording related party
transactions which led to restatement of previously issued financial statements;
● Lack of proper procedures to maintain
supporting documents for accounting records; and
● Lack of proper oversight for the
Company’s cash disbursement process that led to misuse of the Company funds by its former executive.
42
In order to remediate the material weaknesses
stated above, we intend to explore implementing additional policies and procedures, which may include:
●
Hiring additional accounting staff to report the internal financial timely;
● Hiring  of CEO and CFO to properly set up the Company’s
internal control and oversight process;
●
Reporting other material and non-routine transactions to the Board and obtain proper approval;
●
Recruiting additional qualified professionals with appropriate levels of U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience to assist in resolving accounting issues in non-routine or complex transactions;
●
Developing and conducting U.S. GAAP knowledge, SEC reporting and internal control training to senior executives, management personnel, accounting departments and the IT staff, so that management and key personnel understand the requirements and elements of internal control over financial reporting mandated by the U.S. securities laws;
●
Setting up budgets and developing expectations based on understanding
of the business operations, compare the actual results with the expectations periodically and document the reasons of the fluctuations
with further analysis. This should be done by CFO and reviewed by CEO, communicated with the Board;
●
Strengthening corporate governance ;
●
Setting up policies and procedures for the Company’s related party identification to properly identify, record and disclose related party transactions; and
●
Setting up proper procedures for the Company’s fund disbursement process to ensure that cash is disbursed only upon proper authorization, for valid business purposes, and that all disbursements are properly recorded.
