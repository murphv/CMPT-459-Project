NOTE
1.
ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Summit
Networks Inc. (together with its subsidiary, the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Nevada
on
July
8, 2014 . Originally, the Company was formed to
engage in the development and operation of a business engaged in the distribution of glass craft products produced in China. On May 8,
2018, the Company acquired Real Capital Limited, a Hong Kong company (“Real Capital”), to seek opportunities in the food
and beverage industry. On March 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Real Capital SPA”) pursuant
to which it sold its interests in Real Capital. The closing of the Real Capital SPA occurred on April 10, 2019.
On
May 8, 2020, Sumnet (Canada) Inc. (“Sumnet (Canada)”) was incorporated in Canada. Sumnet (Canada) issued all its ordinary
shares to the Company so that Sumnet (Canada) became the wholly owned subsidiary of Company. On July 29, 2020, Smith Barney Enterprises
Limited (“Smith Barney”) was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Smith Barney issued all its ordinary shares to the
Company on July 29, 2020, so that Smith Barney became the wholly owned subsidiary of Company. On August 28, 2020, Green Energy (HK) Limited
(“Green Energy”) was incorporated in Hong Kong. Green Energy issued all its ordinary shares to Smith Barney on August 28,
2020, so that Green Energy became the wholly owned subsidiary of Smith Barney. On September 27, 2020, Beijing Asian League Wins Technology
Co., Ltd. (“Beijing ALW”) was incorporated in People’s Republic of China. Green Energy subscribed all capital stock
of Beijing ALW on September 27, 2020, so that Beijing ALW became the wholly owned subsidiary of Green Energy.
On
January 20, 2021, Beijing ALW and Green Energy entered into a series of contractual agreements (the “VIE Agreement”) with
Hengshui Jingzhen Environmental Company Limited (“Hengshui Jingzhen”, or the “VIE”), whereby Beijing ALW
gained control over Hengshui Jingzhen, a P.R. China company, which provides integrated hazardous waste management services, including
collecting, transferring, disposing, and recycling of hazardous waste, primarily in Hebei, China. On March 29, 2021, the board of directors
and a majority shareholder of the Company approved the termination of the VIE Agreements with Hengshui Jingzhen. On the same date, Beijing
ALW, Hengshui Jingzhen, and Hengshui Jingzhen’s shareholders entered into a Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”)
to terminate all existing VIE Agreements signed on January 20, 2021. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, all of the rights and obligations
under the existing VIE Agreements were terminated and the Company no longer had control of Hengshui Jingzhen. See NOTE 4. EXECUTION AND
TERMINATION OF VIE AGREEMENTS.
On
January 20, 2021, the Company changed its fiscal year-end from July 31 to September 30.
On
November 30, 2022, Future Era Tech, Inc. (“FET”), a corporation incorporated and existing under the laws of British Columbia
entered a contract with Summit Networks, Inc. Under the terms of the Agreement, FET will acquire
5,000,000
shares of common stock of
SNTW for $ 200,000 .00. FET will then be collaborating with Sumnet (Canada), Inc. (“Sumnet”), a Canadian corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of SNTW, in the business of designing and selling clean energy equipment, such as flameless heaters and boilers.
These products will be sold to the commercial and residential markets located primarily in Asia and Europe.
Currently,
we are in the stage of implementation of our new business plan dividing into three phases. In the short term, we will perform post maintenance
services and supply of spare parts for welding automation lines that have already been exported. The medium term will be the implementation
of services for the supply of industrial materials for projects in the Asian region. The long term will be the sale of methanol boiler
heating equipment and industrial intelligence products in North America.

NOTE
2.
GOING CONCERN
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
The
Company had limited operations and has not generated any revenue since its inception, July 8, 2014, resulting in accumulated deficit
of $ 1,246,440
as of December 31, 2022. There is no guarantee that Company will generate revenue and net income in the future. Since a
trial order on December 28, 2022, shows that the company has moved from no revenue to a functioning business model.
At
December 31, 2022, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $ 590,523 . These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
on the undertaking of its shareholders to provide continuing financial support to enable the Company to meet its liabilities as and when
they fall due.
The Company actively looks for new business opportunities, and its
operating expenses are soley relied on loans from the shareholders.
NOTE
3.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation and Consolidation
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are on deposit with financial institutions
without any restrictions. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, cash equivalents amounted to $ 205,530
and $ 8,829 , respectively.
Fixed
Assets
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related capitalized assets.
Related parties
Parties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered
to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over
the other party in making financial and operational decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common
control or common significant influence.
- 7 -
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes”.
The asset and liability method provide that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences
of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit
carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect
when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that
is believed more likely than not to be realized.
ASC
740 provides guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return. If the Company determines that an uncertain tax position exists in which the Company could incur income taxes, the Company will
evaluate whether there is a probability that the uncertain tax position taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities.
A liability for uncertain tax positions would then be recorded if the Company determined it is more likely than not that a position would
not be sustained upon examination or if a payment would have to be made to a taxing authority and the amount is reasonably estimable.
The Company does not believe any uncertain tax positions exist that would result in the Company having a liability to the taxing authorities.
The Company classifies interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of interest expense
and other expense in the statements of operations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining
to uncertain tax positions.
Net loss per share
The Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic
260, “Earnings per Share.” Basic income per share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed similar to basic income per share except that the denominator
is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents
had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.
Fair
Value Measurements
The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value as used
in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements.
The
carrying values of cash, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value. Pursuant to ASC 820 and 825, the fair value
of cash is determined based on "Level 1" inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
ASC
820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement
date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
Level
1 — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level
2 — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable
Level
3 — inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)
The
Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis.
- 8 -
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
The
Company adopts new pronouncements relating to generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the Company as they are issued,
which may be in advance of their effective date. The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements
and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition
or the results of its operations.
NOTE
4.
EXECUTION AND TERMINATION OF VIE AGREEMENTS
On
January 20, 2021, Beijing ALW and Green Energy entered into a series of contractual arrangements, including Equity Pledge Agreement,
Exclusive Technology Development, Consulting and Services Agreement, Exclusive Option Agreement, and Irrevocable Power of Attorney (collectively,
the “VIE Agreements”) with Hengshui Jingzhen, whereby Beijing ALW gained control over Hengshui Jingzhen, a P.R. China
company, which provides integrated hazardous waste management services, including collecting, transferring, disposing, and recycling
of hazardous waste, primarily in Hebei, China. This transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger in which the Company was the legal
acquirer and Hengshui Jingzhen was the accounting acquirer.
On
March 29, 2021, due to changes of the Company’s business plan, the board of directors and a majority shareholder of the Company
approved the termination of the VIE Agreements with Hengshui Jingzhen. On the same date, Beijing ALW, Hengshui Jingzhen, and Hengshui
Jingzhen’s shareholders entered into a Termination Agreement to terminate all existing VIE Agreements signed on January 20, 2021.
Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, all of the rights and obligations under the existing VIE Agreements were terminated and the Company
had no control of Hengshui Jingzhen.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in
this Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results
could differ materially from those discussed in the forward- looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences
include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Report. Our audited financial statements are stated in United
States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
This
section provides management’s discussion of the financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations of
Summit Networks, Inc. with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources. It includes management’s
interpretation of our financial results, the factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to affect future operating results
and future investment and financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto.
Several
factors exist that could influence our future financial performance and some of those are discussed below and elsewhere in this report.
They should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by us or
on our behalf since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking
statements.
Background
Summit
Networks Inc. (together with its subsidiary, the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July
8, 2014. Originally, the Company was formed to engage in the distribution of glass craft products produced in China. On May 8, 2018,
we acquired Real Capital Limited, a Hong Kong company (“Real Capital”), to seek opportunities in the food and beverage industry.
On March 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Real Capital SPA”) pursuant to which it sold
its interests in Real Capital. The closing of the Real Capital SPA occurred on April 10, 2019.
Results
of Operations
During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we generated revenues.
Our operating expenses for the same periods were comprised of general and administrative expenses of $28,185 and $76,204, respectively.
Our general and administrative expenses consisted of mainly professional fees for the year ended September 30, 2022, and consisted of
mainly management fees and chief executive fees for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease of general and administrative expenses
was mainly due to the decrease of management fees and chief executive fees.
Our
total assets as of December 31, 2022 were $205,530.
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had 67,049,990 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
As
of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, there are a total of $579,000 and $579,000 in amounts respectively, due to related parties
and shareholders were interest free, unsecured and payable on demand.
Based
on our current operating plan, we may need to obtain additional financing to operate our business. Additional financing, whether through
public or private equity or debt financing, or if available.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
The Company had a negative operating cash flow of $3,299 for the three
months ended December 31, 2022, and a negative operating cash flow of $19,267 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Such decrease was primarily due to lower net loss in year ended December 31, 2022.
The net cash generated from financing activity resulted from the proceeds
from capital raising amounting to $200,000.
- 11 -
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern
basis which contemplates the realization of an asset and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
The Company’s liquidity and capital needs relate primarily to working capital and other general corporate requirements. The Company’s
operations currently provide cash flow. The business will require significant amounts of capital in the near term to sustain operations
and make the investments it needs to continue operations and execute its longer-term business plan. As of December 31, 2022, we had $205,530
in cash and a deposit of $3,285. The working capital deficits were $590,523 and $762,338 for the three months ended December 31, 2022,
and September 30, 2022, respectively. These factors raise confidence about our ability to continue as a going concern as discussed in
the footnotes to our financial statements. The Company will be able to conduct its planned operations as we plan to obtain financing in
the near term to meet the needs of our on-going operations, generate future revenue from operations and/or obtain the necessary financing
to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. In order to implement its
business plan, management’s plan includes raising capital by equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any
assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. If we issue equity or equity equivalents to raise additional
funds, our existing stockholders will experience substantial dilution and the new holders of securities may have rights, preferences and
privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. Management also cannot provide any assurance that unforeseen circumstances will
not increase the need for the Company to raise additional capital on an immediate basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able
to continue to raise funds if at all, or on terms acceptable to the Company in which case the Company may be unable to continue its operations
or to meet its obligations. If adequate capital is not available when needed, we will be required to significantly modify our business
model or cease operations.
On March 11, 2020 the World Health
Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic and recommended containments and mitigation
measures worldwide. The Company is monitoring this closely, and although operations have no t been materially affected by the
coronavirus outbreak to date, the ultimate severity of the outbreak is uncertain. Operations of the Company are ongoing. Further the
uncertain nature of the spread of COVID-19 globally may impact our business operations due to the quarantine of employees,
customers, and third-party service providers.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that is material to investors.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As
required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision
of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives,
and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.

Material
Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management
conducted its evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of our chief executive officer and our chief financial
officer. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of December 31, 2022 due to the following material weaknesses that our management
identified in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022:
1).
We
do not have an Audit Committee — While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management’s
view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company’s
financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member
that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management’s activities.
2).
We
lack internal accounting personnel who possesses U.S GAAP knowledge and working experience.
Management
has evaluated, and continues to evaluate, avenues for mitigating our internal controls weaknesses, but mitigating controls to completely
mitigate internal control weaknesses have been deemed to be impractical and prohibitively costly, due to the size of our organization
at the current time. Management expects to continue to use reasonable care in following and seeking improvements to effective internal
control processes that have been and continue to be in use at the Company.
We
plan to take steps to remediate this material weaknesses as soon as practicable by implementing a plan to improve our internal control
over financial reporting including, but not limited to, hiring additional staff who has U.S. GAAP knowledge and working experience and/or
maintaining outside consultants experienced in U.S. GAAP financial reporting as well as in SEC reporting requirements.  Our management
team will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial
reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements.
Evaluation
of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our
president (our principal executive officer and our principal accounting officer and principal financial officer), to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of our company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of our company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.
Further,
the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was made as of a specific date, and continued effectiveness
in future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
- 13 -
Management
has conducted, with the participation of our president (our principal executive officer, our principal accounting officer and our principal
financial officer), an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 in accordance
with the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our company’s
internal control over financial reporting was not effective for the reasons set forth above. Our Company is in the process of adopting
specific internal control mechanisms. Future controls, among other things, will include more checks and balances and communication strategies
between the management and the board to ensure efficient and effective oversight over company activities as well as more stringent accounting
policies to track and update our financial reporting.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Except
for the matter described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended
December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
