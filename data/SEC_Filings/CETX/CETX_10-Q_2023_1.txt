ORGANIZATION AND PLAN OF OPERATIONS
Cemtrex

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going
concern and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The going concern basis of presentation
assumes that the Company will continue in operation one year after the date these financial statements are issued and will be able to
realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Pursuant to the requirements of the
ASC 205, management must evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, which raise substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date these financial statements are issued.
This
evaluation does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented
or are not within control of the Company as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this
methodology, management evaluates whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management’s plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it
is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and
(2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about
the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
The
Company has incurred substantial losses of $ 13,020,958
and $ 7,807,995
for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, and has losses on
continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 of $ 3,096,753
and has debt obligations over the next year of $ 17,099,485
and working capital deficit of $ 469,270 , that raise substantial doubt with respect to the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern.
11
While
our working capital deficit and current debt indicate a substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern, the Company has historically, from time to time, satisfied and may continue to satisfy certain short-term liabilities through
the issuance of common stock, thus reducing our cash requirement to meet our operating needs. Additionally, the Company has sold unprofitable
brands, reducing the cash required to maintain those brands, reevaluated our pricing model on our Vicon brand to improve margins on those
products, and has effected a
35:1 reverse stock split
on our common stock to remain trading on the Nasdaq Capital Markets, and improve
our ability to potentially raise capital through equity offerings that we may use to satisfy debt. In the event additional capital is
raised through equity offerings and/or debt is satisfied with equity, it may have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. While
the Company believes these plans are sufficient to meet the capital demands of our current operations for at least the next twelve months,
the is no guarantee that we will succeed. Overall, there is no guarantee that cash flow from our existing or future operations and any
external capital that we may be able to raise will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs. We currently do not have adequate
cash to meet our short or long-term needs. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to
this uncertainty.

INTERIM STATEMENT PRESENTATION
Basis
of Presentation and Use of Estimates
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements and the notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, of Cemtrex Inc.
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the Unites States (“US GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article
10 of Regulation S-X pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC”). Accordingly, they
do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for
the entire year.
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, and the reported amounts of revenues,
expenses and cash flows during the periods presented. Actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and
assumptions the Company makes are based on historical factors, current circumstances and the experience and judgment of the Company’s
management. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.
The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries, Cemtrex Technologies
Pvt. Ltd., Advanced Industrial Services, Inc., and the Company’s majority owned subsidiary Vicon Industries, Inc. and its subsidiary,
Vicon Industries Ltd. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards
In
October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
from Contracts with Customers (“ASU No. 2021-08”). ASU No. 2021-08 will require companies to apply the definition of a performance
obligation under ASC Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue) relating to
contracts with customers that are acquired in a business combination. Under current U.S. GAAP, an acquirer generally recognizes assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and contract liabilities arising from revenue contracts
with customers, at fair value on the acquisition date. ASU No. 2021-08 will result in the acquirer recording acquired contract assets
and liabilities on the same basis that would have been recorded by the acquiree before the acquisition under ASC Topic 606. ASU No. 2021-08
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact
of this ASU on our financial statements.
On
June 30, 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to
Contractual Sale Restrictions (“ASU 2022-03”), which (1) clarifies the guidance in ASC 820 on the fair value measurement
of an equity security that is subject to a contractual sale restriction and (2) requires specific disclosures related to such an equity
security. Under current guidance, stakeholders have observed diversity in practice related to whether contractual sale restrictions should
be considered in the measurement of the fair value of equity securities that are subject to such restrictions. On the basis of interpretations
of existing guidance and the current illustrative example in ASC 820-10-55-52 of a restriction on the sale of an equity instrument, some
entities use a discount for contractual sale restrictions when measuring fair value, while others view the application of such a discount
to be inconsistent with the principles of ASC 820. To reduce the diversity in practice and increase the comparability of reported financial
information, ASU 2022-03 clarifies this guidance and amends the illustrative example. ASU No. 2022-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our financial statements.
The
Company does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material
effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Due
to the on-going losses and risk associated with the SmartDesk business the Company has valued the royalty and SAFE agreement associated with
the SmartDesk sale at $ 0
and considers such consideration to be a gain contingency.
Based
on sales projections for Cemtrex XR, Inc., the Company does not believe that it will exceed the sales levels required to exceed the
$ 820,000
royalties due and has not accounted for any additional royalties at this time. In accordance with
ASC 310 – Receivables,
the
Company has discounted the royalties due and has recognized $ 660,621
of royalties due and will amortize the remaining amount over the period the royalties are due.

LOSS PER COMMON SHARE
Basic
net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive outstanding shares of common stock during the period to reflect the potential dilution
that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent share arrangements, stock options and warrants. For the three months
ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the following items were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per common share as their
effect is anti-dilutive:

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy is applied to prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance for fair value measurements are described below:
Level
1 — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity
has the ability to access at the measurement date. Our Level 1 assets include cash equivalents, banker’s acceptances, trading securities
investments and investment funds. We measure trading securities investments and investment funds at quoted market prices as they are
traded in an active market with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions.
Level
2 — Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially
the full term of the asset or liability.
Level
3 — Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is little, if any, market activity for the
asset or liability at the measurement date. Level 3 assets and liabilities include cost method investments. Quantitative information
for Level 3 assets and liabilities reviewed at each reporting period includes indicators of significant deterioration in the earnings
performance, credit rating, asset quality, business prospects of the investee, and financial indicators of the investee’s ability
to continue as a going concern.

LEASES
The
Company is party to contracts where we lease property from others under contracts classified as operating leases. The Company primarily
leases office and operating facilities, vehicles, and office equipment. The weighted average remaining term of our operating leases was
approximately
3.6
years at December 31, 2022 and
4.3
years at December 31, 2021. Lease liabilities were $ 2,520,506
with $ 787,561 classified
as short-term at December 31, 2022, and $ 2,576,963
with $ 754,495 , classified as short-term at September 30, 2022. The weighted average
discount rate used to measure lease liabilities was approximately
5.6 % at December 31, 2022 and
6.6 % at December 31, 2021. The Company
used the rate implicit in the lease, where known, or its incremental borrowing rate as the rate used to discount the future lease payments.
The
Company also made the accounting policy decision not to recognize lease assets and liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or
less.

2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Except
for historical information contained in this report, the matters discussed are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
When used in this report, words such as “anticipates”, “believes”, “could”, “estimates”,
“expects”, “may”, “plans”, “potential” and “intends” and similar expressions,
as they relate to the Company or its management, identify forward-looking statements. Our operations involve risks and uncertainties,
many of which are outside our control, and any one of which, or a combination of which, could materially affect our results of operations
and whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on
our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of
operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. Such forward-looking
statements are based on the beliefs of the Company’s management, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available
to the Company’s management. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: the effect
of business and economic conditions; the impact of competitive products and their pricing; unexpected manufacturing or supplier problems;
the Company’s ability to maintain sufficient credit arrangements; changes in governmental standards by which our environmental
control products are evaluated and the risk factors reported from time to time in the Company’s SEC reports, including its recent
report on Form 10-K. The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements as a result of future events or developments.

Significant
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S.
GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures at the date of the
financial statements and during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events, our actual
amounts and results could differ from those estimates. The estimates made are based on historical factors, current circumstances, and
the experience and judgment of our management, who continually evaluate the judgments, estimates and assumptions and may employ outside
experts to assist in the evaluations.
Certain
of our accounting policies are deemed “significant”, as they are both most important to the financial statement presentation
and require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect
of matters that are inherently uncertain. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30,
2022.
Results
of Operations – For the three months ending December 31, 2022, and 2021
Total
revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 was $11,970,242 and $9,413,395, respectively, an increase of $2,556,847,
or 27%. Loss from continuing operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was $3,096,753 compared to $3,770,865 for the three
months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease on the loss of $674,112, or 18%. Total revenue for the quarter increased, as compared to total
revenue in the same period last year, due to increased demand for the Company’s products and services. Loss from operations decreased
due to increased revenues as compared to the same period in the prior year.
Revenues
Our
Security segment revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased by $2,646,131 or 40% to $7,004,744 from $4,358,613
for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This increase is due to an increased demand for Security technology.
Our
Industrial Services segment revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022, decreased by $88,474 or 2%, to $4,965,498 from $5,053,972
for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This decrease is mainly due to timing of the recognition of revenue for the segment’s
products and services.
Gross
Profit
Gross
Profit for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was $5,042,615 or 42% of revenues as compared to gross profit of $3,222,250 or 34%
of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Gross
profit in our Security segment was $3,403,690 or 49% of the segment’s revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as
compared to gross profit of $1,791,255 or 41% of the segment’s revenues for the period ended December 31, 2021. Gross profit as
a percentage of revenues increased in the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021,
due to price increases implemented throughout the segment in response to rising costs of our goods and transportation costs.
Gross
profit in our Industrial Services segment was $1,638,925 or 33% of the segment’s revenues for the three months ended December 31,
2022 as compared to gross profit of $1,430,185 or 28% of the segment’s revenues for the period ended December 31, 2021. Gross profit
as a percentage of revenues increased in the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021,
was primarily due to lower subcontractor costs.
25
General
and Administrative Expenses
General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased $7,882 or 0.14% to $5,455,833 from $5,447,951
for the three months ended December 31, 2021. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 46% and 58% of
revenues for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
Research
and Development Expenses
Research
and Development expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022, were $1,538,218 compared to $1,072,898 for the three months ended
December 31, 2021. Research and Development expenses are primarily related to the Security Segment’s development of next generation
solutions associated with security and surveillance systems software.
Other
Income/(Expense)
Other
income/(expense) for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, was an expense of $1,145,317 as compared to an expense of $472,266 for the first
quarter of fiscal 2021. Other income/(expense) for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was mainly driven by interest on the Company’s
debt. Other income/(expense) for the three months ended December 31, 2021, included the gain on the forgiveness of our PPP loans of $971,500.
Provision
for Income Taxes
During
the first quarters of fiscal 2022, and 2021, the Company took no provision on income taxes. The provision for income tax is based upon
the projected income tax from the Company’s various U.S. and international subsidiaries that are subject to their respective income
tax jurisdictions and the Company’s projected ability to utilize net loss carryforwards.
Loss
from Discontinued Operations
As
discussed in Note 3, the Company had losses on discontinued operations of $3,239,621. The losses are comprised of the $2,455,701 loss
on the sale of Cemtrex Advanced Technologies, and Cemtrex XR, Inc.. The net loss of $877,792 for the three months ended December 31,
2022, and the net gain on the recovery of cash from Vicon Industries Ltd. of $89,085. Losses on discontinued operations for the three
months ended December 31, 2021 were $758,241 attributable to the operations of the Cemtrex brands discussed in Note 3.
Net
income/(loss) attributable to Cemtrex, Inc. shareholders
The
Company had a net loss attributable to Cemtrex, Inc. shareholders of $6,277,711, or 52% of revenues, for the three-month period
ended December 31, 2022, as compared to net loss attributable to Cemtrex, Inc. shareholders of $4,477,951 or 42% of revenues, for
the three months ended December 31, 2021. The net loss attributable to Cemtrex, Inc. shareholders increased in the first quarter as
compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the loss on discontinued operations.
Effects
of Inflation
The
Company’s business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information
is presented.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Working
capital deficit was $469,270 at December 31, 2022, compared to working capital of $4,754,493 at September 30, 2022. This includes cash
and equivalents and restricted cash of $7,370,333 at December 31, 2022, and $12,188,096 at September 30, 2022. The decrease in working
capital was primarily due to the Company’s transfer of cash to in the sale of Cemtrex Advanced Technologies and Cemtrex XR, Inc.
and accrual of interest on short-term liabilities during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.
26
Cash
used by operating activities for continuing operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $5,872,310 and $3,633,702
respectively. Cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $2,501,426,
compared to using cash of $719,237. The increase in operating cash usage for continuing operations was primarily due to increases of
trade receivables, prepaid expenses, and other assets and payment of accounts payable and other liabilities.
Trade
receivables increased $1,536,861 or 28% to $6,936,077 at December 31, 2022, from $5,399,216 at September 30, 2022. The increase in trade
receivables is attributable to increased sales in the Security segment.
Inventories increased $116,492 or 1% to $8,604,759 at December 31,
2022, from $8,487,817 at September 30, 2022. The increase in inventories is attributable to inventories in transit yet to be sold.
Cash
used by investment activities for continuing operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $568,111 compared to $291,666
for the three-month period ending December 31, 2021. Cash provided by investing activities for discontinued operations for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 was $207,329. Investing activities for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 were driven mainly by the
Company’s purchase of property and equipment.
Cash
used by financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was $600,920 compared to $632,753 for the three-month
period ending December 31, 2021. Financing activities were primarily driven by payments on the Company’s debt and the
royalties receivable for discontinued operations.
While
our working capital deficit and current debt indicate a substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern, the Company has historically, from time to time, satisfied and may continue to satisfy certain short-term liabilities through
the issuance of common stock, thus reducing our cash requirement to meet our operating needs. Additionally, the Company has recently
sold unprofitable brands, reducing the cash required to maintain those brands, reevaluated our pricing model on our Vicon brand to improve
margins on those products, and has effected a reverse stock split on our common stock to remain trading on the Nasdaq Capital Markets,
and improved our ability to potentially raise capital through equity offerings that we may use to satisfy debt. In the event additional
capital is raised through equity offerings and/or debt is satisfied with equity, it may have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders.
While the Company believes these plans are sufficient to meet the capital demands of our current operations for at least the next twelve
months, the is no guarantee that we will succeed.
Overall,
there is no guarantee that cash flow from our existing or future operations and any external capital that we may be able to raise will
be sufficient to meet our working capital needs. We currently do not have adequate cash to meet our short or long-term needs. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to this uncertainty.

4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
controls and procedures reporting as promulgated under the Exchange Act is defined as controls and procedures that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”)
and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.
Our
CEO and our CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December
31, 2022. Based on their evaluation, our management has concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective and there is a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weakness relates to
the Company lacking sufficient accounting personnel. The shortage of accounting personnel resulted in the Company lacking entity level
controls around the review of period-end reporting processes, accounting policies and public disclosures. Additionally, the Company’s
current processes and systems do not provide for necessary, timely reconciliation of certain accounts and sufficient consideration regarding
recoverability of certain assets. This deficiency is common in small companies, similar to us, with limited personnel.
Notwithstanding
the conclusion by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December
31, 2022, were not effective, and notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below,
management believes that the unaudited condensed financial statements and related financial information included in this Quarterly Report
fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates presented, and
for the periods ended on such dates, in conformity with GAAP.
In
order to mitigate the material weaknesses, the Company has implemented measures that they believe have mitigated these weaknesses but
has not had sufficient time to fully evaluate these measures. These measures include; (i) updating our accounting software to ensure
tighter control over entries and providing improved data for timely reconciliation of certain accounts, and (ii) engaged a third-party
accounting firm to provide review of period-end reporting processes, accounting policies and public disclosures.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
While
there was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s last fiscal quarter that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting,
the Company is continuing to improve its internal controls through the actions mentioned above.
Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls
Our
management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent
all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our
company have been detected.
