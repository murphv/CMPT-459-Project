cautionary
notice regarding forward-looking statements
Statements
in this Quarterly Report and in any documents incorporated by reference herein which are not purely historical, or which depend upon
future events, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements generally
contain words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,”
“plan,” “potential,” “project,” “target,” “can,” “could,” “may,”
“should,” “will,” “will likely,” “would,” or the negative of such words and/or similar
expressions. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these words.
Readers
should not place undue reliance upon the Company’s forward-looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date they
were made. Such forward-looking statements may refer to events that ultimately do not occur, or may occur to a different extent, or occur
at a different time than such forward-looking statements describe. Except to the extent required by federal securities laws, the Company
undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report and in any documents
incorporated by reference herein, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. The Company acknowledges that
all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and/or results to differ materially from
the events and/or results described in the forward-looking statements.

NOTE

ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS
Description
of Operations
Sharing
Services Global Corporation and subsidiaries (“Sharing Services” or the “Company”) aim to build shareholder value
by developing or acquiring businesses, products and technologies in the direct selling industry and other industries that augment the
Company’s product and services portfolio, business competencies, and geographic reach.
The
Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada in April 2015.
Health
and Wellness Products
- The Company’s subsidiaries operating in the health and wellness products industry, which accounted
for substantially all the Company’s consolidated net sales during the periods included in this Quarterly Report, market their products
primarily through an independent sales force, using a direct selling business model under the proprietary brand “The Happy Co.”
Currently, The Happy Co. TM
markets and distributes its health and wellness products primarily in the United States, Canada,
the Republic of Korea, and other countries in the Asia Pacific region.
Subscription-Based
Travel Services
- Through its subsidiary, Hapi Travel Destinations (“MyTravelVentures” or “MTV”), the Company
delivers subscription-based travel services. MyTravelVentures’ services are designed to offer the deepest discounts for travel
relating to airfare, cruises, hotels, resorts, time shares and rental cars for destinations throughout the world for people of all ages,
demographics, and economic backgrounds. MTV will also provide entrepreneurial opportunities to its subscribers by capitalizing on both
the direct selling model and the retail travel business model.
Company-Owned
and Franchised Cafes
– Sharing Services has entered into a Master Franchise Agreement (“MFA”) to acquire the
exclusive franchise rights in North America to the brand “Hapi Café” from Hapi Café, Inc., a company
affiliated with Heng Fai Ambrose Chan, a Director of the Company. Under the MFA, Sharing Services, directly or through its
subsidiaries, will operate no less than five corporate-owned stores and can offer to the public sub-franchise rights to own and
operate other stores. Each corporate-owned or franchised Hapi Café TM
store will allow customers and Brand Partners
seeking a healthier lifestyle access to: (a) functional and healthy food and beverages, (b) a pleasant workspace with free Wi-Fi
service, (c) physical fitness, nutrition management and personal workout print and video content, and (d) the Company’s
proprietary travel services. In August 2022, the Company executed a non-binding letter of intent with American Wealth Mining
Corporation (“AWM”, known previously as American Premium Water Corporation), a related party, allowing AWM to be the exclusive franchisee of Hapi Café in the State of
New York.
Targeted
Ownership Interests
– Directly or through its subsidiaries, the Company from time to time will invest in emerging businesses,
using a combination of debt and equity financing, in efforts to leverage the Company’s resources and business competencies and
to participate in these businesses’ growth. As part of the Company’s commitment to these emerging businesses’ success,
the Company, directly or through its subsidiaries, also offers non-traditional inventory financing, equity or debt financing, order fulfillment
and logistic, CRM “Back Office” solutions, and other success-critical services to these businesses.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation
The
unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”). Certain note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with
GAAP have been condensed or omitted as permitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, although we believe that the disclosures
made are adequate to make the information not misleading. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2022. Unless so stated, the disclosures in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not repeal
the disclosures in our consolidated financial statements for year ended March 31, 2022.
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
9
Use
of Estimates and Assumptions
The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of judgment and requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures about contingent assets and
liabilities, if any. Matters that require the use of estimates and assumptions include: the recoverability of notes and accounts receivable,
the valuation of inventory, the useful lives of fixed assets, the assessment of long-lived assets for impairment, the nature and timing
of satisfaction of performance obligations resulting from contracts with customers, allocation of the transaction price to multiple performance
obligations in a sales transaction, the measurement and recognition of right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities, the valuation
of stock-based compensation awards, the measurement and recognition of uncertain tax positions, and the valuation of loss contingencies,
if any. Actual results may differ from these estimates in amounts that may be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe
that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are reasonable.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash
equivalents include recent customer remittances deposited with our merchant processors at the balance sheet date, which generally settle
within 24 to 72 hours. As of December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents included cash held by our merchant processors
of approximately $ 1.0
million and $ 3.3
million, respectively, including approximately $ 0.9
million and $ 3.0
million, respectively held
by one merchant processor. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents held in bank accounts
in foreign countries in the ordinary course of business were $ 1.4
million and $ 1.4
million, respectively. Amounts held by our merchant
processor or held in bank accounts located in foreign countries are generally not insured by any federal agency.
Notes
Receivable
On
August 29, 2022, the Company and 1044Pro LLC (“1044”) entered in an agreement to modify the Revolving Promissory Note dated
January 22, 2022. In accordance with the amendment, the Company agreed to lend $ 125,000
to 1044 for a
20 % membership interest in 1044.
The loan is secured by the assets of 1044 as well as by a personal guaranty executed by a member of 1044. At December 31, 2022, the amount
due from 1044 is $ 230,355 .
At
December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, notes receivable were $ 926,205
and $ 601,520 , before allowance for impairment losses of $ 709,320
and $ 601,520 , respectively.
Investment
in Marketable Securities
The
Company has invested in a marketable security that can easily be bought, sold, or traded on public exchanges. The investment is carried
at fair market. Unrealized gains and losses have been recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. At December
31, 2022, the investment was valued at approximately $ 4.3
million on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.
Inventory
Inventory
consists of finished goods and promotional materials and are stated at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”)
method, or net realizable value. The Company periodically assesses its inventory levels when compared to current and anticipated sales
levels. As of December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022, the allowance for obsolete inventory was $ 742,311
and
108,055 , respectively, in
connection with the health and wellness products that are either damaged, expired or otherwise considered slowing moving based of historical
or projected sales levels. The Company reports its provisions for inventory losses in cost of goods sold in its consolidated statements
of operations.
Other
Assets
Other
assets include a multi-user license and code of a back-office platform that was acquired for $ 1,000,000
in July 2022. This back-office
platform is designed to facilitate the computation and processing of commission payments to distributors, and it requires customization
in order for it to be operational. Costs associated with the customization and build out of the platform has been capitalized in accordance
with ASC 350 -
Capitalization on Internal-Use Software Costs .

Note
Payable
In
May 2020, the Company was granted a loan (the “PPP Loan”) by a commercial bank in the amount of $ 1.0
million, pursuant to
the Paycheck Protection Program features of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the “CARES Act”).
At March 31, 2021, loan principal in the amount of $ 1.0
million was outstanding. The Company’s borrowings under the PPP Loan were
eligible for loan forgiveness under the provisions of the CARES Act. In June 2021, the Company was formally notified by the lender that
the Company’s obligations under the loan have been forgiven effective May 25, 2021. The loan forgiveness applies to all principal
and interest accrued through the loan forgiveness effective date. The Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $ 1.0
million
in connection with such loan forgiveness.
On
June 15, 2022, Linden Real Estate Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, American Pacific Bancorp, Inc. (“APB”),
and the Company entered into a Loan Agreement pursuant to which APB loaned the Company approximately $ 5.7
million. The loan bears interest
at the annual rate of
8 %, matures on June 1, 2024, and is secured by a first mortgage interest on the Company’s Lindon, Utah office
building. In connection with this loan, the Company received net proceeds of $ 5,522,829
from APB on June 17, 2022. APB is a subsidiary
of DSS, Inc. Heng Fai Ambrose Chan, and Frank D. Heuszel, each a Director of APB, also serve on the Board of Directors of the Company.
Monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of $ 43,897
have been made beginning July 1, 2022, and are payable on the same
date of each month thereafter. The Company paid $ 307,279
in principal and interest related to the loan for the nine months ended December
31, 2022.
On
August 11, 2022, the Company executed a revolving credit promissory note with APB (“the APB Revolving Note”) pursuant to
which the Company has access to advances with a maximum principal balance not to exceed the principal sum of $ 10
million. The APB Revolving
Note included origination fees of $ 600,000 . The Note is collateralized by the assets of the Company, and it bears interest at the annual
rate of
8 % and such interest shall be due and payable quarterly. Interest payments on the loan are due and payable on the last day of
each consecutive third calendar month until the maturity date of
August 12, 2024 . On December 9, 2022, APB and the Company mutually agreed
to limit and/or end any further commitment by APB to fund or to readvance under the terms of the APB Revolving Note. As of December 31,
2022, the Company had $ 6.0
million outstanding under the APB Revolving Note and no accrued interest as of the date.
Foreign
Currency Translation
As
part of our strategic growth plan initiatives, we have expanded our operations outside the United States. The functional currency of
each of our foreign operations is generally the respective local currency. Balance sheet accounts are translated into U.S. dollars (our
reporting currency) at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, while the results of operations and cash flows are
generally translated using average exchange rates for the periods presented. Individual material transactions, if any, are translated
using the actual rate of exchange on the transaction date. The resulting translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive
loss in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards - Recently Adopted
In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12,
Income Taxes (Topic 740) – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes
(“ASU
2019-12”). ASU 2019-12, among other things, (a) eliminates the exception to the incremental approach for intra-period tax
allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income (or a gain) from other items, (b) eliminates the exception to
the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when the year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss
for the year, (c) requires that an entity recognize a franchise tax (or a similar tax) that is partially based on income as an
income-based tax and account for any incremental amount incurred as a non-income-based tax, and (d) requires that an entity reflect
the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation for the interim period that
includes the enactment date. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 effective April 1, 2021, and adoption did not have a material impact on
its consolidated financial statements.
12
Recently
Issued Accounting Standards - Pending Adoption
In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06,
Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives
and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity
(ASU 2020-06), which simplifies the accounting for certain convertible
instruments. Among other things, under ASU 2020-06, the embedded conversion features no longer must be separated from the host contract
for convertible instruments with conversion features not required to be accounted for as derivatives, or that do not result in substantial
premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. ASU 2020-06 also eliminates the use of the treasury stock method when calculating the impact
of convertible instruments on diluted Earnings per Share. For the Company, the provisions of ASU 2020-06 are effective for its fiscal
quarter beginning on April 1, 2024. Early adoption is permitted, subject to certain limitations. The Company is evaluating the potential
impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
NOTE

LOSS PER SHARE
We
calculate basic loss per share by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted loss per share is calculated similarly but reflects the potential impact of shares issuable
upon the conversion or exercise of outstanding convertible preferred stock, convertible notes payable, stock warrants and other commitments
to issue common stock, except where the impact would be anti-dilutive.
The
calculation of diluted loss per share also reflects an adjustment to net loss for the potential reduction to a reporting period’s
interest expense, net of applicable income tax, which would result if the Company’s convertible notes payable were converted at
the beginning of such reporting period.
The
following table sets forth the computations of basic and diluted loss per share:

INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES, NET
In
September 2021, the Company, Stemtech Corporation (“Stemtech”) and Globe Net Wireless Corp. (“GNTW”) entered
into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) pursuant to which the Company invested $ 1.4
million in Stemtech in exchange
for: (a) a Convertible Promissory Note in the amount of $ 1.4
million in favor of the Company (the “Convertible Note”) and
(b) a detachable Warrant to purchase shares GNTW common stock (the “GNTW Warrant”). Stemtech is a subsidiary of GNTW. As
an inducement to enter into the SPA, GNTW agreed to pay to the Company an origination fee of $ 500,000 , payable in shares of GNTW’s
common stock. The Convertible Note matures on
September 9, 2024 , bears interest at the annual rate of
10 %, and is convertible, at the
option of the holder, into shares of GNTW’s common stock at a conversion rate calculated based on the closing price per share of
GNTW’s common stock during the 30-day period ended September 19, 2021. The GNTW Warrant expires on
September 13, 2024
and conveys
the right to purchase up to
1.4
million shares of GNTW’s common stock at a purchase price calculated based on the closing price
per share of GTNW’s common stock during the 10-day period ended September 13, 2021. In September 2021, GNTW issued to the Company
154,173
shares of its common stock, or less than 1% of the shares of GNTW then issued and outstanding, in payment of the origination
fee. In November 2021, Globe Net Wireless Corp. changed its corporate name to Stemtech Corporation. In connection therewith, the investee’s
common stock is now traded under the symbol “STEK”.
14
The
Company carries its investment in the Convertible Note, the GNTW Warrant and the shares of GNTW common stock at fair value in accordance
with GAAP. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized losses, before income tax, of $ 1.2
million
and $ 4.9
million in connection with its investment in the Convertible Note, the GNTW Warrant and the shares of GNTW common stock.
In
September 2021, the Company entered into a Membership Unit Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired a
30.75 % equity
interest in MojiLife, LLC, a limited liability company organized in the State of Utah, in exchange for $ 1,537,000 . MojiLife is an emerging
growth distributor of technology-based consumer products for the home and car. MojiLife’s products include esthetically attractive,
cordless scent diffusers for the home or for the car, as well as proprietary home cleaning products and accessories.
On
a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the recoverability of its investments and reviews current economic trends to determine the adequacy
of its allowance for impairment losses based on each investee financial performance data and other relevant information. An estimate
for impairment losses is recognized when recovery in full of the Company’s investment is no longer probable. Investment balances
are written off against the allowance after the potential for recovery is considered remote. In March of 2022, the company impaired the MojiLife investment as the evaluation at such time determined the investment
was not fully recoverable.

The
Company’s convertible notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at the
conversion prices shown above.
In
October 2017, the Company issued a Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $ 50,000
(the “Note”) to HWH International,
Inc. (“HWH” or the “Holder”). HWH is affiliated with Heng Fai Ambrose Chan, a Director of the Company. The Note
is convertible into
333,333
shares of the Company’s Common Stock. Concurrent with issuance of the Note, the Company issued to HWH
a detachable warrant to purchase up to an additional
333,333
shares of the Company’s Common Stock, at an exercise price of $ 0.15
per share. Under the terms of the Note and the detachable stock warrant, the Holder is entitled to certain financing rights. If the Company
enters into more favorable transactions with a third-party investor, it must notify the Holder and may have to amend and restate the
Note and the detachable stock warrant to be identical. On August 9, 2022, HWH and the Company executed an agreement to settle the Note
and cancel the related stock warrant for $ 78,636 , which amount represents the principal plus accrued interest. The Company made the payment
to HWH on August 9, 2022.

On
April 5, 2021, the Company and Decentralized Sharing Systems, Inc. (“DSSI”) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement,
pursuant to which the Company issued: (a) a Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $ 30.0
million (the “Note”)
in favor of DSSI, and (b) a detachable Warrant to purchase up to
150,000,000
shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, at $ 0.22
per share, and DSSI loaned to the Company $ 30.0
million. DSSI, is a subsidiary of DSS, Inc. (formerly Document Security Systems, Inc.,
“DSS”), and, together with DSS, is a major shareholder of the Company. Under the terms of the loan, the Company agreed to
pay to DSSI a loan Origination Fee of $ 3.0
million, payable in shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, at the rate of $ 0.20
per share. The Note bore interest at the annual rate of
8 %, with a maturity date of
April 5, 2024 , subject to certain accelerated provisions
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, as was defined in the Note. At any time during the term of the Note, all or part of the Note,
including the principal amount less unamortized prepaid interest, if any, plus any accrued interest could have been converted into shares
of the Company’s Class A Common Stock at the rate of $ 0.20
per share, at the option of the holder. Interest on the Note was pre-payable
annually in cash or in shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, at the option of the Company, except that interest for the
first year was pre-payable in shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, at the rate of $ 0.20
per share. As further discussed
below, the Note and the detachable Warrant were redeemed in June 2022.
In
connection with the issuance of the Note and the detachable Warrant, the Company allocated $ 15.0
million of the net proceeds from the
loan to the detachable Warrant, allocated $ 12.0
million of the net proceeds to the beneficial conversion feature embedded in the Note
and recognized deferred financing costs of $ 3.0
million. The resulting debt discount and the deferred financing costs were being amortized
into interest expense over the term of the note (three years). During the nine months ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued to
DSSI
27,000,000
shares of its Class A Common Stock, including
15,000,000
shares in payment of the loan Origination Fee and
12,000,000
shares in prepayment of interest for the first year and recognized a deemed dividend of $ 1,080,000
for the excess of the fair value of
the shares issued over the amounts settled.
On
June 15, 2022, the Company and DSSI which, together with DSS, is a majority shareholder of the Company, entered into an agreement pursuant
to which the Company issued, to DSSI: (a) a two-year Convertible, Advancing Promissory Note in the principal amount of $ 27.0
million
(the “2022 Note”) in favor of DSSI and (b) a detachable Warrant to purchase up to
818,181,819
shares of the Company’s
Class A Common Stock at the exercise price of $ 0.033
per share. The 2022 Note bears interest at the annual rate of
8 % and is due and
payable on demand or, if no demand, on May 1, 2024. At any time during the term of the 2022 Note, all or part of the Note may be converted
into up to
818,181,819
shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, at the option of the holder. Under the terms of the agreement,
the Company agreed to pay to DSSI a loan origination fee of $ 270,000 . In addition, DSSI agreed to surrender to the Company all DSSI’s
rights pursuant to: (a) a certain Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $ 30.0
million issued by the Company in April
2021 in favor of DSSI, and (b) a certain detachable Warrant to purchase up to
150,000,000
shares of the Company’s Class A Common
Stock, at $ 0.22
per share, issued concurrently with such $ 30.0
million note. The Company recognized the transaction with DSSI as a debt
extinguishment in accordance with GAAP .
Since DSSI is a related party, the difference between the fair value of the new equity
instruments and the carrying value of the retired equity instruments, was recognized in additional paid in capital on the Company’s
condensed consolidated balance sheet.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, interest expense in connection with the Company’s convertible
notes was $ 552,000
and $ 605,934 , respectively, excluding amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs of $ 2.5
million and
$ 2.3
million, respectively. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, interest expense in connection with
the convertible notes were $ 1.2
million and $ 1.8
million, respectively, excluding amortization of debt discount and deferred financing
cost of $ 5.6
million and $ 6.7
million respectively. These amounts are included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Legal
Matters in General
The
Company has incurred several claims in the normal course of business. The Company believes such claims can be resolved without any material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
The
Company maintains certain liability insurance. However, certain costs of defending lawsuits are not covered by or only partially covered
by its insurance policies, including claims that are below insurance deductibles. Additionally, insurance carriers could refuse to cover
certain claims, in whole or in part. The Company accrues costs to defend itself from litigation as they are incurred.
The
outcome of litigation is uncertain, and despite management’s view of the merits of any litigation, or the reasonableness of the
Company’s estimates and reserves, the Company’s financial statements could nonetheless be materially affected by an adverse
judgment. The Company believes it has adequately reserved for the contingencies arising from current legal matters where an outcome was
deemed to be probable, and the loss amount could be reasonably estimated. No provision for legal matters was deemed necessary at December
31, 2022.
Legal
Proceedings
The
Company from time to time is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the conduct of its business in the ordinary course.
We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

Overview
Summary
Description of Business
Sharing
Services Global Corporation and subsidiaries (“Sharing Services”, “we,” or the “Company”) aim to
build shareholder value by developing or acquiring businesses and technologies that increase the Company’s product and services
portfolio, business competencies, and geographic reach. Sharing Services’ combined platform leverages the capabilities
and expertise of various companies that market and sell products direct to the consumer through independent contractors. The Company’s
new shared service platform will service this direct selling “gig economy” sector by providing needed services (such as equity and inventory financing, advisory services, mobile application tools, merchant processing services,
commercial insurance, and event planning) to smaller direct sales companies initially in the U.S.
Currently, the Company, through its subsidiaries,
markets and distributes its health and wellness and other products primarily in the U.S. and Canada using a direct selling business
model. The Company’s U.S. subsidiaries market our products and services through an independent sales force, using their proprietary
websites, including:
www.elevacity.com
and
www.thehappyco.com . In September 2021, the Company, through a subsidiary, commenced
operations in the Republic of Korea (South Korea).
The
Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 24, 2015.
As
further discussed below, the Company intends to continue to grow its business both organically and by making strategic acquisitions from
time to time of businesses and technologies that augment its product portfolio, complement its business competencies, and fit its growth
strategy.
Convertible
Notes and Borrowing Under Short-term Financing Arrangements
Historically,
the Company has funded a substantial portion of its liquidity and cash needs through the intermittent issuance of convertible notes and
borrowings under short-term financing arrangements, and through the intermittent issuance of equity securities. See “Liquidity
and Capital Resources” below for additional information about the Company’s convertible notes and borrowings under short-term
financing arrangements.
Industry
and Business Trends
The
information in “Industry and Business Trends” included in ITEM 1
—
“Business” in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, is incorporated herein by reference.
Strategic
Profitable Growth Initiatives
The Company intends to continue to grow its business
by pursuing a multipronged growth strategy, that includes: (a) expanding its product offerings, both within the health and wellness category
and in new product categories, (b) expanding its direct-to-consumer geographic footprint (primarily in Asia), and (c) expanding its membership-based
consumer travel products line in the U.S. and worldwide. This growth strategy may also include the use of strategic acquisitions of businesses
that augment the Company’s product and services portfolio, business competencies and geographic reach.
Continuing
Uncertainty Regarding the Recent COVID-19 Pandemic
In
2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments in the countries where our products are sold mandated or recommended various containment
measures, including selective business closures, social distancing, quarantine, stay-at-home or shelter-in-place directives, and limitations
on, or cancellations of, larger meetings and other public events. We believe that the actual impact of the health crisis, and/or actions
taken to contain the spread of the virus, have had and continue to have an adverse impact on the economies in the geographies we serve.
Consumer demand for discretionary products such as ours is sensitive to significant downturns in the economy, increases in unemployment
or decreases in perceived employment security, and decreases in consumer sentiment in general.
In
efforts to protect our customers, distributors, employees, and other business partners, in 2020, we instituted several preventive measures,
including temporarily transitioning a significant number of our corporate employees to working remotely, increasing efforts to clean
and sanitize our business facilities, increasing employee safety communication, and transitioning our sales conventions to a virtual
convention platform. While these temporary measures are increasingly being eased or fully reversed at the time of this Quarterly Report,
we believe these necessary, temporary measurements are likely to have had an adverse impact on our business.
26
As
a result of the foregoing, we cannot predict with certainty the scope, duration, and ultimate impact of this public health emergency
in the countries where we operate, including its impact on the economy, but we believe these conditions are likely to have had and continue
to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations (including revenues and
profitability), and those of our key suppliers.
The
COVID-19 pandemic also may have the effect of exacerbating some of the other risk factors described elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, including the success of our growth initiatives, our ability to anticipate and effectively
respond to changes in consumer preferences and buying trends in a timely manner, our dependence on one supplier for a substantial portion
of the products we sell, potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial performance, our ability to generate sustained, positive cash
flows from operations with which to fund our working capital needs, the potential impact on our financial performance from economic slowdowns,
our ability to effectively and cost-efficiently respond to any epidemics and other health emergencies, and the potential impact on our
business of any disruption in our information technology systems.
Results
of Operations
Three
months ended December 31, 2022, Compared to Three months ended December 31, 2021
Net
Sales
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, our consolidated net sales decreased by $3.9 million, or 54.4%, to $3.2 million, compared to
the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net sales mainly reflects: (a) continuation of the decline in consumer orders
that we experienced since the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020, (b) a decline in independent distributor orders, in the number
of new independent distributors and in the number of continuing active distributors, resulting, in part, from recent product reformulations
and increased competition for independent distributors, and (c) the generally adverse impact on consumer buying trends resulting from
the recent increase in consumer good prices and in energy costs in the U.S. and from lingering effects of the COVID global health emergency
and actions taken to help mitigate the spread of the virus in the geographies in which we operate. In efforts to restore strong sales
growth, in the past several months, we have developed and launched our new business brand, “The Happy Co TM ,” at
our Elevacity division, have accelerated our previously announced initiatives to expand our operations into additional international
geographies, and have further intensified our efforts to recruit, develop and reward our distributors and our efforts to reach new consumers,
including through the continued introduction of new products.
We
believe there continues to be significant uncertainty about the potentially adverse impact of the current health crisis on the economies
and employment markets of several countries, including the U.S. and Canada. Please see Overview -
Significant Uncertainty Regarding
the Potential Impact of Ongoing COVID Health Crisis
above.
The
$3.9 million decrease in consolidated net sales primarily reflects a decrease in number of comparable product units sold, partially offset
by sales of products introduced since December 31, 2021, of approximately $1.2 million.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021,
the Company derived substantially all its consolidated
net sales from the sale of its Elevate health and wellness product line.
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, approximately 63% of the Company’s net sales were to customers (including 39% to recurring
customers, refer herein as “SmartShip” sales, and approximately 24% to new customers) and approximately 37% of the Company’s
net sales were to independent distributors.
Gross
Profit
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, our consolidated gross profit decreased by $3.2 million, or 66.5%, to $1.6 million, compared
to the three months ended December 31, 2021, and our consolidated gross margins were 49.4% and 67.3%, respectively. For the three months
ended December 31, 2022, gross margin was affected by an increase in shipping expenses and promotional pricing, as a percentage of sales.
Selling
and Marketing Expenses
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, our consolidated selling and marketing expenses decreased by $3.3 million, to $0.9 million,
or 28.6% of net sales compared to $4.2 million, or 59.3% of net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in consolidated
selling and marketing expenses is due primarily to lower sales commissions of $2.6 million (which reflects decrease in our consolidated
net sales discussed above).
27
General
and Administrative Expenses
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, our consolidated general and administrative expenses (which include corporate employee compensation
and benefits, stock-based compensation, professional fees, rent and other occupancy costs, certain consulting fees, telephone and information
technology expenses, insurance premiums, and other administrative expenses) increased by approximately $1.1 to $4.7 million, or 144.1%
of consolidated net sales compared to $3.6 million, or 50.8% of consolidated net sales, for the three months ended December 31 , 2021.
The increase in consolidated general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher consulting expenses offset by a decrease
in employee compensation and benefits and legal expenses.
Interest
Expense, net
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, our consolidated interest expense, net was 3.3 million, including amortization of debt discount
and deferred financing costs, interest income, and other expenses associated with borrowings from “DSSI” and related parties.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2021,
our consolidated interest expense was $3.1 including
amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs, interest income, and other expenses associated with borrowings from “DSSI”
and related parties.
Net
Other Non-Operating Expenses
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, we had net consolidated non-operating expenses of approximately $6.9 million. For the three
months ended December 31, 2021, our consolidated non-operating income was approximately $2.1 million.
Unrealized
Gain (Loss) on Investments in Unconsolidated Entities and Marketable Securities
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, net unrealized losses, before income tax, in connection with our investments in unconsolidated
entities and marketable securities w ere
$3.6 million.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2021, net unrealized gains, before income tax, in connection with our investment in unconsolidated
entities were $1.2 million.
Gain on Employee Warrants Liability
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a compensatory gain of $39,375, compared to $154,488 for the three months ended
December 31, 2021, in connection with employee warrants with a variable exercise price after service was completed.
Income
Tax Benefit
Income
tax benefit includes current and deferred income taxes for both our domestic and foreign operations. Income from our international operations
is subject to taxation in the countries in which we operate.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a state and local tax benefit of $22,849 and a provision for deferred federal
income taxes of $348,236 and a benefit for current federal income taxes of $429,516.
Net
Loss and Loss per Share
As
a result of the foregoing, for the three months ended December 31, 2022, our consolidated net loss was $11.0 million, compared to $6.9
million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, our diluted
loss per share was $0.04 and $0.04, respectively.
28
Nine
months ended December 31, 2022, Compared to the Nine months ended December 31, 2021
Net
Sales
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, our consolidated net sales decreased by $15.5 million, or 54.8%, to $12.7 million, compared
to the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net sales mainly reflects: (a) continuation of the decline in consumer orders
that we experienced since the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020, (b) a decline in independent distributor orders, in the number
of new independent distributors and in the number of continuing active distributors, resulting, in part, from recent product reformulations
and increased competition for independent distributors, and (c) the generally adverse impact on consumer buying trends resulting from
the recent increase in consumer good prices and in energy costs in the U.S. and from lingering effects of the COVID global health emergency
and actions taken to help mitigate the spread of the virus in the geographies in which we operate. In efforts to restore strong sales
growth, in the past several months, we have developed and launched our new business brand, “The Happy Co TM ,” at
our Elevacity division, have accelerated our previously announced initiatives to expand our operations into additional international
geographies, and have further intensified our efforts to recruit, develop and reward our distributors and our efforts to reach new consumers,
including through the continued introduction of new products.
We
believe there continues to be significant uncertainty about the potentially adverse impact of the current health crisis on the economies
and employment markets of several countries, including the U.S. and Canada. Please see Overview -
Significant Uncertainty Regarding
the Potential Impact of Ongoing COVID Health Crisis
above.
The
$15.5 million decrease in consolidated net sales primarily reflects a decrease in the number of comparable product units sold, partially
offset by sales of products introduced since December 31, 2021, of approximately $800,000.
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021,
the Company derived substantially all its consolidated
net sales from the sale of its Elevate health and wellness product line.
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, approximately 63% of the Company’s net sales were to customers (including 39% to recurring
customers, refer herein as “SmartShip” sales, and approximately 24% to new customers) and approximately 37% of the Company’s
net sales were to independent distributors.
Gross
Profit
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, our consolidated gross profit decreased by $11.9 million, or 60.8%, to $7.7 million, compared
to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, and our consolidated gross margins were 60.3% and 69.5%, respectively. For the nine months
ended December 31, 2022, gross margin was affected by shipping expenses and promotional pricing, as a percentage of sales.
Selling
and Marketing Expenses
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, our consolidated selling and marketing expenses decreased by $8.7 million, to $5.7 million,
or 44.9% of net sales compared to $14.4 million, or 51.0% of net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in consolidated
selling and marketing expenses is due primarily to lower sales commissions of $8.6 million (which reflects decrease in our consolidated
net sales discussed above) partially offset by higher sales convention expenses of approximately $454,465 (as we resumed holding some
in-person conventions).
General
and Administrative Expenses
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, our consolidated general and administrative expenses (which include corporate employee
compensation and benefits, stock-based compensation, professional fees, rent and other occupancy costs, certain consulting fees,
telephone and information technology expenses, insurance premiums, and other administrative expenses) decreased by approximately
$94,370 to $13.8 million, or 108.2% of consolidated net sales compared to $13.9 million, or 49.2% of consolidated net sales, for the
nine months ended December 31 , 2021. The decrease in consolidated general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by lower
professional fees, employee compensation and benefits and legal expenses.
Interest
Expense, net

the nine months ended December 31, 2022, our consolidated interest expense was $9.8 million, including amortization of debt discount
and deferred financing costs, interest income, and other expenses associated with borrowings from “DSSI” and related parties.

the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a compensatory gain of $207,210, compared to $1.9 million for the nine months
ended December 31, 2021, in connection with employee warrants with a variable exercise price after service was completed.
Gain
on Extinguishment of Debt
For
the nine-month ended December 31, 2022, no amounts were incurred related to extinguishment of debt. In June of 2021, the Company’s
borrowings under the Paycheck Protection Program features of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the “CARES
Act”) were forgiven pursuant to the CARES Act. The Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $1.0 million, before
income tax, in connection therewith.
Income
Tax Benefit
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized a provision for deferred taxes and federal taxes of $799,748 and a
state and local tax benefit of $9,945.
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a consolidated provision for current federal income taxes of $5.2 million,
net of a valuation allowance recognized of $4.5 million, and a consolidated provision for state and local taxes of $109,241 and a consolidated
deferred income tax benefit of $4.0 million.
Net
Loss and Loss per Share
As
a result of the foregoing, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, our consolidated net loss was $30.8 million, compared to $13.2
million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, our diluted
loss per share was $0.12 and $0.07, respectively.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
We
broadly define liquidity as our ability to generate sufficient cash, from internal and external sources, to meet our obligations and
commitments. We believe that, for this purpose, liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources.
Working
Capital
We had a deficiency in our working
capital of approximately $23.2 million as of December 31, 2022, and a working capital of approximately $7.4 million as of March 31,
2022. As of December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents were $3.1 million.
We have implemented measures to
restructure our business operations and reduce our monthly cash burns and operating loss. Such measures include, and are not limited
to, headcount reduction and elimination of certain overhead and consulting fees. Based upon the current level of operations and
anticipated investments necessary to sustain/grow our business, we believe that existing cash balances and anticipated funds from
operations will likely be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements over the next 12 months.
Historical
Cash Flows
Historically,
our primary sources of cash have been capital transactions involving the issuance of equity securities and secured and unsecured debt
(See “Recent Issuances of Equity Securities” and “Short-term Borrowings and Convertible Notes” below) and cash
flows from operating activities; and our primary uses of cash have been for operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
net cash advances to related parties, and debt repayments in the ordinary course of our business.

following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the nine months ended December

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net cash
used in operating activities was $8.8 million, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $13.7 million for the nine months
ended December 31, 2021. The $4.3 million change was due primarily to decline in gross profit, excluding non-cash items, such as depreciation
and amortization, stock-based compensation gain, provision for obsolete inventory losses, amortization of debt discount, losses on impairment
of investments in unconsolidated entities, a note receivable, and the gain on extinguishment of debt. In addition, the change in net cash
used in operating activities reflects a change in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $6.3 million driven by the normal
recurring operations of the business.
Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities
For the nine months ended December
31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was $11.5 million, compared to $12.2 million for the nine months ended December 31,
2021. Included in the $11.5 million of net cash outflow was cash paid for marketable securities of approximately $9.5 million during
the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $26.6 million, to $6.5 million, compared
to $33.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to refinancing of the June 2022 DSSI loan.
Impact
of currency rate changes in cash
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the impact of currency rate changes in cash was negative $35,864 compared to negative
$45,331 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021.

Potential
Future Acquisitions
The
Company, directly and through its subsidiaries, may make strategic acquisitions and purchases of equity interests in businesses that
complement its business competencies and growth strategy. Such acquisitions and purchases of equity interests are expected to be funded
with cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operations, if any, and issuance of equity securities and debt.
Short-term
Borrowings and Convertible Notes
Borrowing
Under Financing Arrangements (Note Payable)
In

the Paycheck Protection Program features of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the “CARES Act”) .
The Company’s borrowings under the PPP Loan were eligible for loan forgiveness under the provisions of the CARES Act. In June of
2021, the Company was formally notified by the lender that the Company’s obligations under the loan had been forgiven effective
May 25, 2021. The loan forgiveness applies to all principal and interest accrued through the loan forgiveness effective date.

A Common Stock, at $0.22 per share, issued concurrently with such $30.0 million note, as discussed in the preceding paragraph.
American
Pacific Bancorp, Inc.
On
June 15, 2022, Linden Real Estate Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, American Pacific Bancorp, Inc. (“APB”),
a subsidiary of DSS, and the Company entered a Loan Agreement pursuant to which APB loaned the Company approximately $5.7 million. The
loan bears interest at the annual rate of 8%, matures on December 1, 2024, and is secured by a first mortgage interest on the Company’s

Chan and Frank D. Heuszel, each a Director of the Company, also serve on the Board of Directors of APB.

Capital
Requirements
During
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, capital expenditures for property and equipment (consisting of furniture and fixtures,
computer equipment and software, other office equipment and leasehold improvements) in the ordinary course of our business were $1.4
million which primarily relates to the purchase of the multi-user license and code for development of a new sales commissions’
platform.
32
Contractual
Obligations
There
were no material changes to our contractual cash obligations during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, except for (a) the June
2022 refinancing of our loan from DSSI (b) the June 2022 financing of our Lindon, Utah office building, and (c) the August 2022
revolving line of credit with APB, as all described above.
Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements
As
of December 31, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
Inflation
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation
was generally been low in the geographies where we operate. However, at the time of this Quarterly Report, the increase in price of
consumer goods in the United States has reached a 40-year high, primarily as a result of higher energy costs, higher housing costs,
and the impact global supply chain disruptions. Please see “ Our business and financial performance could be adversely
affected by inflation”
contained in ITEM 1A, — “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 .
Critical
Accounting Estimates
While
the Company is not aware of material changes to its critical accounting estimates or assumptions since March 31, 2022, it is reasonably
possible that estimates made in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been, or will be, materially
impacted as a result of the ultimate resolution of the uncertainties associated with the COVID health crisis. This may include estimates
regarding allowance for slow-moving or obsolete inventory, impairment losses related to long-lived assets, the nature and timing of satisfaction
of performance obligations resulting from contracts with customers, and the valuation of loss contingencies. Please see Overview -
Continuing
Uncertainty Regarding the Recent COVID Pandemic
above.
Accounting
Changes and Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For
discussion of accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.
Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
The
Company is a Smaller Reporting Company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and, accordingly, is not required to provide the
information called for by this item.
Item
4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”)
and our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the fiscal period covered by this Annual Report, and concluded that, as of December
31, 2022, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required
to be disclosed in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
management and its Board of Directors, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Limitations
on the Company’s Controls and Procedures.
We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors
and all fraud. Any system of controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. Because of the limitations in all such systems, no evaluation can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud (if any) within the Company have been detected. Furthermore, the design of any
system of disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be
no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how unlikely.
Because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective system of controls and procedures, misstatements and/or omissions due to error
or fraud may occur undetected.
33
In
light of the Form 10-K/A filed by the Company with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 7, 2022, for the purpose of correcting
a typographical error included in its Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity for fiscal years ended March 31,
2022, and 2021, management determined that the Company had a significant deficiency in its internal control over financial reporting.
The significant deficiency was attributable mainly to our failure to effectively review and proofread the registration statement, detect
and correct any errors before it was filed with the SEC. To address this significant deficiency, procedures have been developed and implemented
by the accounting department in August 2022, to ensure the timely review, proof reading and sign-off of all registration statements prior
to their submission to the SEC.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Except for the remedial actions described above, during our most recent fiscal quarter,
there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
