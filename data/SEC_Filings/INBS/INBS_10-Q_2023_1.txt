NOTE
1.
ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS
Business
Intelligent
Bio Solutions Inc. (“INBS”) (formerly known as GBS Inc.), and its wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, GBS Operations Inc. were each formed on December 5, 2016, under the laws of the state
of Delaware. Our Australian subsidiary Intelligent Bio Solutions (APAC) Pty Ltd (formerly known as Glucose Biosensor Systems
(Greater China) Pty Ltd) was formed on August 4, 2016, under the laws of New South Wales, Australia and was renamed to Intelligent
Bio Solutions (APAC) Pty Ltd on January 6, 2023. On October 4, 2022, INBS acquired Intelligent Fingerprinting Limited
(“IFP”), a company registered in England and Wales (the “IFP Acquisition”). The Glucose Biosensor System
(Japan) Pty Ltd and Glucose Biosensor System (APAC) Pty Ltd, were deregistered on January 6, 2023, and June 9, 2022, respectively.
INBS and its subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us,” “our,” “INBS” or the
“Company,” unless context requires or indicates otherwise) were formed to provide a non-invasive, pain free innovative medical devices and screening devices. Our
headquarters are in New York, New York.
We
are a life sciences company marketing and developing non-invasive, real-time diagnostic testing for patients and their primary health
practitioners at point of care. We operate globally with an objective to deliver intelligent pain free diagnostic tests.
Our
current product portfolio includes:
●
A
proprietary portable drug screening system that works by analyzing fingerprint sweat using a one-time cartridge and
portable handheld reader. The system comprises of commercially available non-invasive sweat-based fingerprint diagnostics testing products
(the “IFP products”) that currently detect opioids, cocaine, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabis, methadone,
buprenorphine, and amphetamine. Customers include safety-critical industries such as construction, transportation and logistics
firms, along with drug treatment organizations in the rehabilitation sector, and judicial organizations.
●
A
development stage range of biosensor based Point of Care diagnostic tests (“POCT”) that are developed
in the modalities of clinical chemistry, immunology, tumor markers, allergens, and endocrinology. Our flagship product candidate is
the Saliva Glucose Biosensor (“SGB”), a POCT expected to substitute the finger pricking invasive blood glucose
monitoring for diabetic patients. These tests stem from the Biosensor Platform that we license, across the Asia Pacific Region from
Life Science Biosensor Diagnostics Pty Ltd (“LSBD” or “the Licensor”). The Biosensor Platform is capable of
detecting multiple biological analytes by substituting the GOX enzyme with a suitable alternative for each analyte.
Reverse
Stock Split
At
the annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders held on February 8, 2023 (the “Annual Meeting”), the stockholders
of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Amendment”)
to effect a reverse stock split at a ratio of not less than
1-for-2 and not more than 1-for-35
at any time within 12 months following
the date of stockholder approval, with the exact ratio to be set within this range by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”)
at its sole discretion without further approval or authorization of our stockholders. Pursuant to such authority granted by the Company’s
stockholders, on February 8, 2023, the Board approved a
1-for-20 reverse stock split
(the “Reverse Stock Split”) of the Company’s
common stock and the filing of the Amendment to effectuate the Reverse Stock Split.
On
February 9, 2023, the Company filed the Amendment in order to effect
1-for-20 reverse stock split
of the Company’s common stock.
The Reverse Stock Split was effective at 4:05 p.m., Eastern Time, on February 9, 2023, at which time every twenty shares of the Company’s
issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock. No fractional
shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders of record who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional
share are entitled to the rounding up of the fractional share to the nearest whole number. The par value of the Company’s common
stock and the number of authorized shares of the common stock were not affected by the Reverse Stock Split. The Company’s common
stock began trading on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Capital Market at the open of the markets on February 10, 2023.
The Reverse Stock Split was implemented for the purpose of regaining compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued
listing of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
As
a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of shares of common stock outstanding was reduced from approximately
18,325,289
shares (excluding treasury shares) as of February 8, 2023, to approximately
916,265
shares (excluding treasury shares, and subject to the rounding up of fractional shares), and the number of authorized shares of common stock remains
100
million shares. In order reflect the Reverse Stock Split, proportionate adjustments were made to the per share exercise price and/or
the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or vesting of all outstanding stock options, restricted stock unit awards and
warrants, which will result in a proportional decrease in the number of shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for
issuance upon exercise or vesting of such stock options, restricted stock unit awards and warrants, and, in the case of stock
options and warrants, a proportional increase in the exercise price of all such stock options and warrants. In addition, the number
of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, as
well as any applicable conversion prices, were also adjusted in proportion to the reverse split ratio of the Reverse Stock Split
(subject to adjustment for fractional interests).
Unless
otherwise indicated, all authorized, issued, and outstanding stock and per share amounts contained in the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-20 Reverse Stock Split for all prior periods presented. (See Note 21 for
information and disclosures relating to adjustments related to the Reverse Stock Split).
NOTE

LIQUIDITY
The
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 205-40,
Presentation
of Financial Statements - Going Concern
(ASC 205-40) requires management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going
concern within one year of the date of the financial statements are issued. In each reporting period, including interim periods, an entity
is required to assess conditions known and reasonably knowable as of the financial statement issuance date to determine whether it is
probable an entity will not meet its financial obligations within one year from the financial statement issuance date. Substantial doubt
about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern exists when conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate
it is probable the entity will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they become due within one year after the date the financial
statements are issued.
7
On
December 21, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “December 2022 Purchase Agreement”)
with 14 investors (the “Series D Investors”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Series D
Investors in a Regulation S private placement (the “December 2022 Private Placement”) (i)
176,462
shares of the Company’s Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.01
per share (the “Series D Preferred Stock”), and (ii)
529,386
warrants (the “Series D Warrants”), with each warrant initially representing the right to purchase one share of common
stock ( 0.05
shares post-Reverse Stock Split). An additional
26,469
warrants were issued to Winx Capital Pty Ltd., the placement agent for the
December 2022 Private Placement, with each warrant
initially representing the right to purchase one share of common stock ( 0.05
shares post-Reverse Stock Split) (the “Winx
Warrants”). The Series D Warrants have an i nitial exercise price of $ 0.29
per share ($5.80 per share post-Reverse Stock Split) (subject to adjustment)
and
expire June 22, 2028. The
Winx Warrants
had an i nitial exercise price of $ 0.52
per share ($ 10.40
per share post-Reverse Stock Split) (subject to adjustment)
and
expire
five years following the effective date of a registration statement covering the resale of common stock underlying the Series D
Preferred Stock acquired by the
Series D Investors.
The Series D Preferred Stock and
Series D Warrants were sold together as a unit (“Unit”), with each Unit consisting of one share of Series D Preferred
Stock and three Series D Warrants. Each share of Series D Preferred Stock was initially convertible into three shares of Common
Stock ( 0.15
shares post-Reverse Stock Split) (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events). The purchase price for
the Units was $ 1.25
per Unit. The Units offering price and the Series D Warrants exercise price were priced above the Nasdaq “Minimum Price”
as that term is defined in Nasdaq Rule 5635(d)(1).
The shares of Series D Preferred Stock were initially convertible into an
aggregate of
529,386
shares of Common Stock ( 26,470
shares post-Reverse Stock Split) following shareholder approval of such conversion and without the
payment of additional consideration. The December 2022 Private Placement closed on December 22, 2022. (See Note 21 for information
and disclosures relating to adjustments related to the Reverse Stock Split).
The
Company is an emerging growth company and has not generated sufficient revenues to date. As such, the Company is generally subject
to the risks associated with emerging growth companies. Since inception, the Company has incurred losses and negative cash
flows from operating activities. The Company does not expect to generate positive cash flows from operating activities in the near
future until such time, if at all, the Company completes the development process of its products, including regulatory approvals,
and thereafter, begins to commercialize and achieve substantial acceptance in the marketplace for the first of a series of products
in its medical device portfolio.
The
Company incurred a net loss of $ 420,600
and $ 1,628,893  for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively (net
loss of $ 3,459,998
and $ 4,892,650  for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021). As of December 31, 2022, the Company has
shareholders’ equity of $ 10,354,391 , working capital of $ 1,563,530 , and an accumulated deficit of $ 32,804,746 .
In
the near future, the Company anticipates incurring operating losses and does not expect to generate positive cash flows from operating
activities and may continue to incur operating losses until it completes the development of its products and seek regulatory approvals
to market such products.
The
Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise a substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as going concern within one year after the date of release of the condensed consolidated financial statements. The
Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022, of $ 2,911,682 , will be insufficient to allow the Company to
fund its current operating plan through at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date these financial statements are issued. Accordingly,
the Company will be required to raise additional funds during the next 12 months. The Company is currently evaluating
raising additional funds through private placements and/or public equity financing. However, there can be no assurance that, in the event
that the Company requires additional financing, such financing will be available on terms which are favorable to the Company, or at all.
If the Company is unable to raise additional funding to meet its working capital needs in the future, it will be forced to delay or reduce
the scope of its research programs and/or limit or cease its operations. In addition, the entity may be unable to realize its assets and discharge
its liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern unless it can successfully raise additional capital.
The
Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the
amounts and classification of liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
NOTE

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of presentation
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and
Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information
and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement
of the results for the interim periods, in the opinion of the Company’s management, have been included. Operating results for the
three and six months ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
June 30, 2023. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related footnote disclosures should be read
in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022,
which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 22, 2022 and amended on Form
10-K/A filed with the SEC on October 7, 2022 (as amended, the “2022 Form 10-K”).
8
Principles
of consolidation
These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, all wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries
in which the Company has a controlling voting interest and, when applicable, variable interest entities in which the Company has a controlling
financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. Investments in affiliates where the Company does not exert a controlling financial
interest are not consolidated .
All
significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Equity
offering costs
The
Company complies with the requirements of ASC 340,
Other Assets and Deferred Costs , with regards to offering costs. Prior to the
completion of an offering, offering costs are capitalized as deferred offering costs on the consolidated balance sheets. The deferred
offering costs will be charged to shareholders’ equity upon the completion of the related offering.
Use
of estimates
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from
those estimates.
Business
combinations
The
results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the
date of the acquisition. The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting and allocates the purchase price to the identifiable assets
and liabilities of the relevant acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. Any excess consideration over the fair value
of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price in a business combination
requires the Company to perform valuations with significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies,
estimates of future revenue, costs and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. The Company engages the assistance
of valuation specialists in concluding on fair value measurements in connection with determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in a business combination. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date,
the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion
of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any
subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. Transaction costs associated with
business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of
operations.
Revenue
recognition
Revenue
from contracts with customers is recognized when, or as, the Company satisfies its performance obligations by delivering the promised
goods or service deliverables to the customers. A good or service deliverable is transferred to a customer when, or as, the customer
obtains control of that good or service deliverable.
Financial
information presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by disaggregated information about revenue and other income by product types
for the purpose of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Currently, the Company has two products offerings. Accordingly,
the Company has determined the following reporting segments (Refer to Note 4, Segment Information):
1) Commercially
available Intelligent Fingerprinting Products (IFPG)
2) Development
Stage Saliva Glucose Biosensor Platform (SGBP)
Revenues
are used to evaluate the performance of the Company’s segments, the progress of major initiatives and the allocation of resources.
All of the Company’s revenues, are attributable to the IFPG segment during the three and six months ended December
31, 2022. There was
no
revenues, during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021.
9
Revenue
from the IFPG segment relates to the sale of readers, cartridges and accessories and is summarized as follows:

The other income mainly comprised of deferred grant
income and R&D tax refund.
a)
Deferred grant income
On
June 30, 2021, the Company executed a definitive grant agreement with the Australian Government to assist with building a manufacturing
facility. The grant has a total value of up to $ 4.7
million upon the achievement of certain milestones until March 28, 2024. Proceeds
from the grant will be used primarily to reimburse the Company for costs incurred in the construction of the manufacturing facility.
Accounting
for the grant does not fall under ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers , as the Australian Government will not benefit
directly from our manufacturing facility. As there is no authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP on accounting for grants to for-profit
business entities, we applied International Accounting Standards 20 (“IAS 20”),
Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure
of Government Assistance
by analogy when accounting for the Australian Government grant to the Company.
The
Australian Government grant proceeds, which will be used to reimburse construction costs incurred, meet the definition of grants related
to assets as the primary purpose for the payments is to fund the construction of a capital asset. Under IAS 20, government grants related
to assets are presented in the statement of financial position either by setting up the grant as deferred income that is recognized in
the statement of operation on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset or by deducting the grant in arriving at the carrying
amount of the asset. Either of these two methods of presentation of grants related to assets in financial statements are regarded as
acceptable alternatives under IAS 20. The Company has elected to record the grants received initially as deferred income and deducting
the grant proceeds received from the gross costs of the assets or construction in progress (“CIP”) and the deferred grant
income liability.
Under
IAS 20, government grants are initially recognized when there is reasonable assurance the conditions of the grant will be met, and the
grant will be received. As of June 30, 2021, management concluded that there was reasonable assurance the grant conditions will be met,
and all milestone payment received. The total grant value of $ 4.7
million was recognized as both a grant receivable and deferred grant
income on the grant effective date. The grant receivable was reduced by $ 2.1
million for payments received during the twelve months ended
June 30, 2022 ( no
payments were received during the three or six months ended December 31, 2022) and $ 2.6
million remains in grant receivable
on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. The receivable
balance as of December 31, 2022, is arrived at after considering the forex impact on the grant receivable by our foreign subsidiary.
After
initial recognition, under IAS 20, government grants are recognized in earnings on a systematic basis in a manner that mirrors the
manner in which the Company recognizes the underlying costs for which the grant is intended to compensate. Further, IAS 20 permits
for recognition in earnings either separately under a general heading such as other income, or as a reduction of the cost of the
asset. The Company has elected to recognize government grant income separately within other income for operating expenditures.
Similarly, for capital expenditures, the carrying amount of assets purchased or constructed out of the grant funds are presented net
by deducting the grant proceeds received from the gross costs of the assets or CIP and deferred grant income liability. A total of
$ 38,139
and
$ 98,552
deferred
grant income was recognized within other income during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively.
Deferred
grant income recognized within other income during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 was $ 31,399
and $ 31,399
respectively.
The current and the non-current classification of
the deferred grant income is based on anticipated spending as included in the cash flow forecast prepared by the management.
b)
R&D tax refund
The Company measures the R&D grant income and
receivable by considering the time spent by employees on eligible R&D activities and R&D costs incurred to external service providers.
The R&D tax refund receivable is recognized
when it is probable that the amount will be recovered in full
through a future claim. A total of $ 231,486
and $ 482,393
of R&D tax refund income was recognized in other income during the three
and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. R&D tax refund income was $ 146,392
and $ 146,392
during the three and six months
ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
Development
and regulatory approval expenses
Expenditures relating to research and development
(“R&D”) are expensed as incurred and recorded in development and regulatory approval in the condensed consolidated statements
of operations and Other Comprehensive Loss. R&D expenses include external expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties;
salaries and personnel-related costs; license fees to acquire in-process technology and other expenses. The Company recognizes the benefit
of refundable R&D tax refunds as a R&D tax refund income when there is reasonable assurance that the amount claimed will be recovered
(refer to the R&D tax refund discussion above).
10
Intellectual
property acquired for a particular research and development project and that have no alternative future uses (in other research and development
projects or otherwise) are expensed in research and development costs at the time the costs are incurred.
In
certain circumstances, the Company may be required to make advance payments to vendors for goods or services that will be received in
the future for use in R&D activities. In such circumstances, the non-refundable advance payments are deferred and capitalized, even
when there is no alternative future use for the R&D, until the related goods or services are provided. In circumstances where amounts
have been paid in excess of costs incurred, the Company records a prepaid expense.
Foreign
currency translation
Assets
and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated from local (functional) currency to reporting currency (U.S. dollar) at the spot rate on the consolidated balance sheets date; income and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing
during the year. Foreign currency movements resulted in a gain of $ 361,597
and $ 226,038
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Foreign currency movements resulted in a gain
of $ 7,355
and a loss of $ 60,127
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
Income
taxes
In
accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 740,
Income Taxes , tax positions initially need to be recognized in the consolidated
financial statements when it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. It
also provides guidance for de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had no uncertain tax positions that qualified for either recognition or disclosure in the consolidated
financial statements. Additionally, the Company had no interest and penalties related to income taxes.
Licensing
rights
During
the first quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, the Company purchased the license right procurement assets from LSBD for an
amount of $ 976,308
in relation to the development and approval process for the Glucose Biosensor Technology in the APAC region. The Company
recorded the license at the historical carrying value in the books of LSBD which was $nil and recorded the amount paid as a deemed dividend.
The Company has agreed to pay royalties of sales & milestones payments as defined.
On
September 12, 2019, the Company entered into an amended and restated license agreement for Saliva Biosensor Technology. On June 23, 2020,
the Company entered into a license agreement with LSBD for the worldwide rights to SARS-CoV-2 application of the Saliva Glucose Biosensor.
In
relation to these licenses, there is no set expiration date for the license. However, the exclusivity of the license granted under the
license agreement runs until the expiration of the patent portfolio covered by the agreement which is currently until 2033. No royalties
have been incurred through to December 31, 2022.
11
On
March 31, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with LSBD to provide the Company an option to acquire an exclusive license to use
LSBD’s intellectual property in the Saliva Glucose Biosensor in North America (the “Option Agreement”). The Option
Agreement has a term of
two years
ending March 31, 2023, and the exercise price for the option is $ 5,000,000 . The fee of $ 500,000
incurred
for the option was expensed in the period incurred. The option has not been exercised to date.
Inventories
Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, other costs that have
been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. General market conditions, as
well as the Company’s research activities, can cause certain of its products to become obsolete. The Company writes down excess
and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected demand. The determination
of projected demand requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to projected sales for each product. These write downs can
influence results from operations.
Trade,
note and other receivables
Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation
of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the Company, and a failure to make contractual
payments for a period of greater than 90 days past due.
Based upon the assessment
of these factors, the Company recorded a bad debt provision of $ 22,918
during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022.
No
bad debt provision was recognized during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021. Trade receivables are recognized net
of bad debt provision.
Property,
Plant and Equipment (PPE) & Construction in Progress (CIP)
In
accordance with the ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, the Company’s PPE, except land, is stated at cost net of accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Land is stated at cost less any impairment losses. Costs incurred to acquire, construct,
or install PPE, before the assets is ready for use, are capitalized in CIP at historical cost. The carrying amount of assets purchased
or constructed out of the grant funds are presented net by deducting the grant proceeds received from the gross costs of the assets or
CIP. CIP is not depreciated until such time when the asset is substantially completed and ready for its intended use. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations in the period in which the expense is incurred. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful life of the asset using the following terms:
●
Computers
hardware and software –
3
years
●
Equipment,
Furniture and fixtures –
2 - 4
years
●
Leasehold
improvements –
shorter of asset’s estimated useful life and the remaining term of the lease
The
assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed periodically and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
Equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising upon
de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying value of the asset)
is included in gain or loss on sale of assets in the consolidated statements of operations in the period the asset is derecognized.
12
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess
of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. The Company evaluates its goodwill
for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value
of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. The Company’s divisions are at the operating segment level, which is the level the Company’s
management conducts regular reviews of the operating results. Goodwill created by acquiring a foreign operation is converted from foreign entity’s functional currency to Company’s reporting currency using the spot
rate prevailing at the reporting date.
Intangible
assets
Intangible
assets are considered long-lived assets and are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any. The intangible
assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed any contractual periods. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets acquired from a foreign operation are translated from the foreign entity’s
functional currency to the presentational currency based on the exchange rate at the reporting date.
Leases
The
Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Lease arrangements are comprised primarily of real estate for which
the right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and the corresponding lease liabilities are presented separately on the consolidated balance
sheet.
ROU
assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease
payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated
present value of lease payments over the lease term. The lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain
that the option will be exercised. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.
The
Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments considering the term of the
lease, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, considering publicly available data for instruments
with similar characteristics. The Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
Impairment
of long-lived assets
Long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may
not be recoverable. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable,
the Company compares the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows, excluding interest costs, expected
to be generated by the asset group and its ultimate disposition. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying
value, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value
of the asset group. The Company did not recognize any impairments of long-lived assets during the three and six months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021.
Net
loss per share attributable to common shareholders (“EPS”)
The
Company calculates earnings per share attributable to common shareholders in accordance with ASC 260,
Earning Per Share . Basic
net loss per share attributable to common shareholders is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is calculated by dividing net
loss attributable to common shareholders by weighted average common shares outstanding during the period plus potentially dilutive common
shares, such as share warrants.
Potentially
dilutive common shares is calculated in accordance with the treasury share method, which assumes that proceeds from the exercise
of all warrants are used to repurchase common share at market value. The number of shares remaining after the proceeds are exhausted
represents the potentially dilutive effect of the securities.
As
the Company has incurred net losses in all periods, certain potentially dilutive securities, including convertible preferred stock, warrants
to acquire common stock, and convertible notes payable have been excluded in the computation of diluted loss per share as the effects
are antidilutive.
13
Recently
issued accounting pronouncements
As
the Company is an emerging growth company, we have elected to defer the adoption of new accounting pronouncements until they would apply
to private companies.
Adopted:
In
August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2020-06,
Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options
(“ASU 2020-06”), which simplifies the guidance on the
issuer’s accounting for convertible debt instruments by removing the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a cash conversion
feature and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. As a result, entities will not separately present in equity
an embedded conversion feature in such debt and will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt, unless certain other conditions
are met. The elimination of these models will reduce reported interest expense and increase reported net income for entities that have
issued a convertible instrument that is within the scope of ASU 2020-06. Also, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted
method for calculating diluted earnings per share and treasury stock method will be no longer available. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06
as of July 1, 2022. Adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
Leases
(“ASU 2016-02”). This update requires all leases with a term
greater than 12 months to be recognized on the balance sheet through a right-of-use asset and a lease liability and the disclosure of
key information pertaining to leasing arrangements. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021,
and interim period within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, as amended by ASU 2020-05 with early adoption permitted. The
Company adopted the standard on July 1, 2022. There was no impact on adoption of ASU 2016-02 as the Company did not have any material
leases as of July 1, 2022, and, therefore, application of transitional practical expedients provided by the ASU is not applicable. Topic
842 was applied to the lease assumed as part of the acquisition of IFP on October 4, 2022. See Note 10 for further information and disclosures
relating to ASC 842.
Pending
adoption:
In
November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2021-10,
Government Assistance
(“ASU 2021-10”). This update requires annual disclosures about transaction with a government
that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. Required disclosures include (1) information
about the nature of the transactions and the related accounting policy used to account for the transactions, (2) the line items on the
balance sheet and income statement that are affected by the transactions, and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line
item, and (3) significant terms and conditions of the transactions, including commitments and contingencies. ASU 2021-10 is applicable
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. The Company is planning to complete the required ASU
2021-10 disclosures with the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending on June 30, 2023. Based on the management’s
assessment of ASU 2021-10, this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In
October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08,
Business Combinations (Topic 805) – Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract
Liabilities from Contracts with Customers
(“ASU 2021-08”). ASU 2021-08 requires that an acquirer recognize and measure
contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, as if it had originated the
contracts. Prior to this ASU, an acquirer generally recognized contract assets acquired and contract liabilities assumed that arose from
contracts with customers at fair value on the acquisition date. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023,
with early adoption permitted. The ASU is to be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date
of the amendment. The Company has not early adopted and continues to evaluate the impact of the provisions of ASU 2021-08 on its consolidated
financial statements.
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 (Topic 326),
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
(“ASU 2016-13”).
This update (a) significantly changes the impairment model for most financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and certain
other instruments from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model which will be based on an estimate of current expected credit
loss (“CECL”) (ASC 326-20); and (b) provides for recording credit losses on available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt
securities through an allowance account (ASC 326-30). The standard also requires certain incremental disclosures. Subsequently, the FASB
issued several ASUs to clarify, improve, or defer the adoption of ASU 2016-13. ASU 2016-13, as amended by ASU 2019-10, is applicable
for Smaller Reporting Companies (“SRCs”) for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted.
The Company has not early adopted the standard and continues to evaluate the impact.
14
Concentration
of credit risk
The
Company places its cash and cash equivalents, which may at times be in excess of the Australia Financial Claims Scheme, Financial Services
Compensation Scheme or the United States’ Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits, with high credit quality financial
institutions and attempts to limit the amount of credit exposure with any one institution.
Fair
value of financial instruments
The
accounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major
asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price,
representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three-tier
fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level
1 -Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
2 -Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets
that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
term of the assets or liabilities.
Level
3 -Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities.
Assets
and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the
fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its
entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.
The
carrying amounts of cash equivalents, prepaid and other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are representative of their
respective fair values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company has elected to carry its convertible notes
at fair value.
Fair
value option (“FVO”) for convertible notes
The Company elected the FVO for recognition of
its convertible notes payable upon issuance as permitted under ASC 825, Financial Instruments. Under the FVO, the Company recognizes the
convertible notes payable at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The FVO may be applied instrument by instrument,
but it is irrevocable. As a result of applying the FVO, direct costs and fees related to the convertible notes are recognized in general
and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as incurred and not deferred. Changes in accrued interest
for the notes are included in the change in fair value of convertible notes. Changes in fair value of the convertible notes are recognized
as part of interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
NOTE

SEGMENT INFORMATION
Operating
segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed
by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing
performance. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company has determined it operates in two operating segments and
has two reportable segments, as the CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by disaggregated
information about revenue and other income by product types for the purpose of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.
Currently, the Company has two products offerings. Accordingly, the Company has determined the following reporting segments:
1) Commercially
available Intelligent Fingerprinting Products (“IFPG” or “IFPG segment”)
2) Development
Stage Saliva Glucose Biosensor Platform (“SGBP” or “SGBP segment”)

INTELLIGENT FINGERPRINTING LIMITED ACQUISITION
On October 4, 2022, INBS acquired
100 % of the outstanding
shares of Intelligent Fingerprinting Limited (IFP), a company registered in England and Wales, pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement, dated October 4, 2022 (the “Share
Exchange Agreement”) by and among IFP, the holders of all of the issued shares in the capital of IFP (the “IFP Sellers”)
and a representative of the Sellers. IFP owns a
portfolio of intellectual property for diagnostic tests and associated technologies, including drug testing through the analysis of fingerprint
sweat. The acquisition of IFP has expanded the Company’s platform of rapid, non-invasive diagnostic testing technologies.

Pursuant
to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired from the Sellers all of the issued and outstanding shares in the capital stock
of IFP, and as consideration therefor, the Company issued and sold to the Sellers upon the closing of the IFP Acquisition (the
“IFP Closing”) an aggregate number of (i)
2,963,091
shares ( 148,155
shares post-Reverse Stock Split) of the Company’s common stock, and (ii)
2,363,003
shares of the Company’s Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.01
per share (the “Series C Preferred Stock”).
Up to an
additional
1,649,273
shares of Series C Preferred Stock have been reserved for potential future issuance by the Company, consisting of (i)
500,000
shares of Series C Preferred Stock,
that are being held back from the IFP Sellers for one year
after the IFP Closing to secure potential indemnification claims by the Company against the IFP Sellers and
(ii)
1,149,273
shares of Series C Preferred Stock to certain lenders to IFP (the “IFP Lenders”). Each
share
of
Series C Preferred Stock
was initially
convertible into three shares of
Common Stock ( 0.15
shares post-Reverse Stock Split) (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events), contingent upon approval by the
Company’s stockholders.
Effective contemporaneously
with the IFP Closing, the Company entered into an amendment to the bridge facility agreement between the Company and IFP, dated as of
June 16, 2022, pursuant to which, among other things, the $ 504,938
(including accrued interest) loan from the Company to IFP that will
remain outstanding following the date of the IFP Closing until the second anniversary of the date of the IFP Closing (the “Company-IFP
Loan Agreement”).
The loan receivable from
IFP of $ 504,938
as of October 4, 2022, was treated as a cash consideration in accordance with
ASC 805 Business Combinations.
The Company
entered into various loan agreements in the aggregate amount of £ 1,254,270.26 , including accrued interest, pursuant to which IFP
is the borrower and the Company became a guarantor of IFP’s obligations thereunder (the “IFP Loan Agreements” and, together
with the Company-IFP Loan Agreement, the “Loan Agreements”). Under the Loan Agreements, the loans thereunder remained outstanding
following the IFP Closing and (x) the loans and certain accrued interest will convert into shares of IFP, which shares of IFP will be immediately
transferred to the Company in exchange for shares of common stock and Series C Preferred Stock (as set forth in the Share Exchange Agreement)
following approval of the Company Stockholder Approval Matters (defined below) or (y) the loans and certain accrued interest will become
repayable on the second anniversary of the date of the IFP Closing. The loans bear interest at
17 % per annum on a compounded basis, increasing
to
22 % per annum on a compounded basis with effect from the date that falls 12 months following the date of the IFP Closing, if the Company
Stockholder Approval Matters have not been approved by the Company’s stockholders by such date. The
“ Company
Stockholder Approval Matters” means the
approval by the Company’s stockholders of (i)
the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock into common stock and (ii)
any amendments to, or adoption of, any option or warrant
plans to give effect to the transactions contemplated under the Share Exchange Agreement.
Each
share of
Series C
Preferred Stock (other than the IFP Lender Preferred Shares) would automatically
convert into common stock upon approval of the Company’s stockholders of the conversion of Series C Preferred Stock into common
stock, and each IFP Lender Preferred Share would convert into common stock at the option of the applicable holder of such IFP Lender
Preferred Shares following approval of the Company’s stockholders of the conversion of Series C Preferred Stock into common stock.
In the event Company stockholder approval is not received, the convertible notes and accrued interest would remain outstanding. The number of shares of common stock into which the Series C Preferred Stock is convertible is subject to adjustment in
the case of any stock dividend, stock split, combinations, or other similar recapitalization with respect to the common stock.
The rights, preferences and
privileges of the Series C Preferred Stock are set forth in the Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series
C Convertible Preferred Stock that the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 4, 2022, as further
described below (the “Series C Certificate of Designation”).
The Series C Preferred
Stock does not have any voting rights (other than as required by law) and does not carry dividends or a liquidation preference. Each
share of Series C Preferred Stock was initial convertible into 3 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment as noted above.
Following the effectiveness of the
1-for-20
Reverse Stock Split
effective on February 9, 2023 (the “Reverse Stock Split”), each share of Series C Preferred
Stock is convertible into
0.15
shares
of common stock. See Note 21 for further information and disclosures relating to Reverse Stock Split. The loan receivable from IFP
of $ 504,938
as
of October 4, 2022, was treated as a cash consideration in accordance with
ASC 805 Business Combinations.
The cash purchase consideration includes $ 504,938
(including accrued interest) of funds previously loaned to IFP by the Company, representing a note receivable from IFP and $ 363,500
for
bonus payments made on behalf of the selling shareholders of IFP. The first installment of $ 181,750
was paid during the three months ended
December 31, 2022. A second installment of $ 181,750
will be made on six-month anniversary of closing date of the acquisition and is recognized
as consideration payable included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The Company incurred $ 806,397
of equity issuance costs in relation to issuing common and
Series C Preferred Stock
to acquire IFP. These costs were recognized as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The
provisional allocation of the purchase price of IFP to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their relative fair values,
is as follows:

include technology of $ 5,119,000
(which is estimated to have a useful life of  5
years), customer
relationships of $ 252,000
(which are estimated to have a useful life of
3
years), and trade names and trademarks of $ 92,000
(which are
estimated to have an
indefinite
useful life). The value assigned to technology was determined using the multi-period excess earnings

The
acquisition produced $ 3,803,293
of goodwill, which has been assigned to the IFPG reporting unit. The goodwill is attributable to
a combination of IFP’s assembled workforce and other product and operating synergies. Goodwill arising from the IFP Acquisition
is not deductible for tax purposes.
The
purchase price allocation is considered provisional as the Company finalizes its determination relating to the valuation of assets and
liabilities and key assumptions, approaches and judgements with respect to intangible assets acquired and the related tax effects.
Transaction
costs, except for the equity issuance costs discussed above, were not material.
Intangibles acquired were remeasured at December 31, 2022 using the
applicable spot rate.
From
the closing date of the IFP Acquisition through December 31, 2022, the Company recognized approximately $ 356,679
in revenue and $ 315,753
in net gain relating to IFP, which included the amortization of $ 340,022
acquired intangibles and fair value gain on revaluation of
convertible notes for $ 1,267,791 . In addition, the Series C Preferred holdback stocks which has been treated as deferred considerations,
were revalued as of December 31, 2022, and resulted in the revaluation gain of $ 525,300 .

CONVERTIBLE NOTES
As a result of the IFP Acquisition, the Company became the guarantor to
unsecured convertible notes (also referred to herein as the IFP Loan Agreements) for which IFP is the borrower. The convertible notes,
plus certain accrued interest, will become due on October 4, 2024 (the second anniversary of the IFP Acquisition closing date), unless
earlier converted. The convertible notes, if converted, will convert into shares of IFP, which shares of IFP will be immediately transferred
to the Company in exchange for shares of the Company’s common stock and Series C Preferred Stock (as set forth in the Share Exchange
Agreement) following approval by the Company’s stockholders of the Company Stockholder Approval Matters.
The
convertible notes bear an interest rate of
17 %
per annum, on a compounded basis. The interest rate will increase to
22 %
per annum, on
a compounded basis, on October 4, 2023 (the first anniversary of the IFP Acquisition closing date) if the Company’s shareholders
have not yet approved the Company Stockholder Approval Matters have not been approved by the Company’s stockholders by such date.
Due
to the Company’s election to apply the fair value option (FVO), the fair value of the convertible notes is subsequently re-measured at the end of
each reporting period based on the changes in their estimated fair value. See Note 15 for additional information.

NOTE
12.
NOTE PAYABLE
As
a result of the acquisition of IFP, the Company assumed a note payable due to a distributor of IFP. The unpaid principal balance of

Payments
of
10 %

NOTE

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Convertible
notes
As
detailed in Note 11, the Company assumed convertible notes as a result of the IFP
Acquisition
and elected to account for the convertible
notes under the FVO. The Company estimated the fair value of the convertible notes based on
the
fair value of the maximum shares issuable upon conversion ( 1,149,273
shares of Series C convertible preferred stock) less one year of
estimated interest to be incurred until October 4, 2023, since the number of shares
to be issued factors in the interest charges for one year. If the note converts earlier than one year less shares will be issued as a
result of this. If the note converts between year 1 and year 2 the maximum amount of shares gets issued and the Company will incur
22 %
annual interests for the period up to the date of conversion in the second year. The Company continues to estimate the fair value of the convertible
notes using this method, reducing the estimated interest adjustment each quarter as the 1-year anniversary of the IFP
Acquisition
approaches.
Accordingly, as of December 31, 2022,
the fair value movement
relates
to
the
decrease
in the share price from the time of acquisition to reporting
date .
Increases
or decreases in the fair value of the Company’s convertible notes carried at fair value are recognized as part of Other Income
(expenses) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The interests incurred from the date of acquisition until
December
31,
2022 ,
are included as part of the Interest expense in the condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations. None of the change in the value of the convertible notes was attributable to instrument
specific credit risk.
The
following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of the convertible note liabilities measured at fair value
on a recurring basis during the period:

C Preferred Stock (holdback)
The
Company has holdback
500,000
Series C Preferred Stock, from the IFP Sellers for one year after the IFP Closing to secure potential indemnification claims by the
Company against the IFP Sellers.
Therefore, the
final number of shares to be issued after the one year measurement period is contingent on any potential claims and can be variable .
Each
share of
Series C Preferred Stock was initially
convertible into three shares of Common Stock
( 0.15
shares post-Reverse Stock Split)
(subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified
events), contingent upon approval by the Company’s stockholders. These shares are reserved, not issued, or held in Escrow
account. As at December 31, 2022, the Company accounted for the fair value movement

INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATE
On
May 29, 2020, LSBD, issued
14,000,000
common shares of BiosensX (North America) Inc. to the Company at par value of $ 0.001
per share.
This transaction provided the Company with a
50 % interest in BiosensX (North America) Inc., the holder of the technology license for
the North America region.
21
The
investment in BiosensX (North America) Inc. is accounted for by use of the equity method in accordance with ASC 323,
Investments -
Equity Method and Joint Ventures .
At
the date of this transaction, LSBD was the parent of both the Company and BiosensX (North America) Inc., the transfer of BiosensX shares
to the Company was deemed to be a common control transaction. As a result of the share transfer, the Company has significant influence
over BiosensX (North America) Inc.
During
the year ended June 30, 2022, LSBD sold all the shares it held in the Company but retained ownership of 5-year non-transferrable
warrants to purchase
3,000,000
common shares ( 150,000
shares post-Reverse Stock Split) of the Company at an exercise price of $ 17
per share ($ 340.00
per share post-Reverse Stock Split), expiring December 31, 2025. The Company determined whether it has a controlling
financial interest in BiosensX (North America) Inc. by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a VIE
under GAAP. Voting interest entities are entities in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to
finance itself independently and provides the equity holders with the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual
returns and the right to make decisions about the entity’s activities. The Company consolidates voting interest entities in
which it has all, or at least a majority of, the voting interests. As defined in applicable accounting standards, VIEs are entities
that lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A controlling financial interest in a VIE is present when
an enterprise has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
The enterprise with a controlling financial interest, known as the primary beneficiary, consolidates the VIE. The Company concluded
that it does not have a controlling financial interest in BiosensX (North America) Inc., hence it continues to recognize its
investments in BiosensX (North America) Inc. using the equity method.
The
carrying amount of investments in BiosensX (North America) Inc. was $ nil
as of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022.

subject to compliance with tests of continuity and additional rules.
The
net operating loss carried forward gives rise to a deferred tax asset of approximately $ 8,149,550
after offsetting associated
deferred tax liabilities. However, the Company has determined that a valuation allowance of $ 8,149,550
against such deferred tax
asset is necessary, as it cannot be determined that the losses carried forward will be utilized.

LOSS PER SHARE
Basic
loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss allocable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock or common stock equivalents outstanding after adjusting for the Reverse Stock Split on February 8, 2023. Diluted loss per common share is computed similar to basic loss per common
share except that it reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common
stock were exercised or converted into common stock.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
At
the annual meeting of stockholders held on February 8, 2023 (the “Annual Meeting”), the stockholders of the Company
approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Amendment”) to
effect
the
reverse stock split at a ratio of not less than 1-for-2 and not more than 1-for-35 at any time within 12 months following the date
of stockholder approval, with the exact ratio to be set within this range by the Company’s Board of Directors (the
“Board”) at its sole discretion without further approval or authorization of our stockholders. Pursuant to such
authority granted by the Company’s stockholders, the Board approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock
Split”) of the Company’s common stock and the filing of the Amendment to effectuate the Reverse Stock Split. The
Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Reverse Stock Split became effective in accordance
with the terms of the Amendment at 4:05 p.m. Eastern Time on February 9, 2023 (the “Effective Time”).
The
Amendment provided that, at the Effective Time, every 20 shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in par value per share, which
remains $ 0.01
per share .
As
a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of shares of common stock outstanding was reduced from approximately
18,325,289
shares
(excluding treasury shares) as of February 8, 2023, to approximately
916,265
shares (excluding treasury shares, and subject to the rounding up of fractional shares), and the number of authorized shares of common stock remains
100
million
shares. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, proportionate adjustments were made to the per share exercise price and/or the
number of shares issuable upon the exercise or vesting of all outstanding stock options, restricted stock unit awards and warrants
(including the Series A Warrants, the Series B Warrants, the Series D Warrants and the Winx Warrants), which will result in a
proportional decrease in the number of shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise or vesting of
such stock options, restricted stock unit awards and warrants, and, in the case of stock options and warrants, a proportional
increase in the exercise price of all such stock options and warrants. In addition, the number of shares reserved for issuance under
the Company’s 2019 Long Term Incentive Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time was reduced proportionately. The number of
shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, as
well as any applicable conversion prices, were also adjusted in proportion to the reverse split ratio of the Reverse Stock Split
(subject to adjustment for fractional interests).
No
fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders of record who would otherwise be entitled to receive
a fractional share are entitled to the rounding up of the fractional share to the nearest whole number. The Reverse Stock Split was
effective at 4:05 p.m., Eastern Time, on February 9, 2023, and the Company’s common stock began trading on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted
basis on The Nasdaq Capital Market at the open of the markets on February 10, 2023. The Company’s post-Reverse Stock Split common
stock has a new CUSIP number (CUSIP No. 36151G402), but the par value and other terms of the common stock were not affected by the Reverse
Stock Split.
The
table below sets forth the impact of the pre- and post- reverse stock split on the Company’s net loss per common share - basic
and diluted; weighted average common shares outstanding - basic and diluted; and shares issued and outstanding, for the years ended
June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2021; the six months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021; and the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Overview
Intelligent
Bio Solutions Inc. (“INBS”) (formerly known as GBS Inc.), and its wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, GBS Operations Inc. were each formed on December 5, 2016, under the laws of the state of Delaware.
Our Australian subsidiary Intelligent Bio Solutions (APAC) Pty Ltd (formerly known as Glucose Biosensor Systems (Greater China) Pty Ltd)
was formed on August 4, 2016, under the laws of New South Wales, Australia and was renamed to Intelligent Bio Solutions (APAC) Pty Ltd
on January 6, 2023. On October 4, 2022, INBS acquired Intelligent Fingerprinting Limited (“IFP”), a company registered in
England and Wales (the “IFP Acquisition”). The Glucose Biosensor System (Japan) Pty Ltd and Glucose Biosensor System (APAC)
Pty Ltd, were deregistered on January 6, 2023, and June 9, 2022, respectively. INBS and its subsidiaries (collectively, “we,”
“us,” “our,” “INBS” or the “Company,” unless context requires or indicates otherwise)
were formed to provide a non-invasive, pain free innovative medical devices and screening devices. Our headquarters are in New York,
New York.
We
are a life sciences company marketing and developing non-invasive, real-time diagnostic testing for patients and their primary health
practitioners at point of care. We operate globally with an objective to deliver intelligent pain free diagnostic tests.
Our
current product portfolio includes:
●
A
proprietary portable drug screening system that works by analyzing fingerprint sweat using a one-time cartridge and
portable handheld reader. The system comprises of commercially available non-invasive sweat-based fingerprint diagnostics testing products
(the “IFP products”) that currently detect opioids, cocaine, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabis, methadone,
buprenorphine, and amphetamine. Customers include safety-critical industries such as construction, transportation and logistics
firms, along with drug treatment organizations in the rehabilitation sector, and judicial organizations.
●
A
development stage range of biosensor based Point of Care diagnostic tests (“POCT”) that are developed
in the modalities of clinical chemistry, immunology, tumor markers, allergens and endocrinology. Our flagship product candidate is
the Saliva Glucose Biosensor (“SGB”), a POCT expected to substitute the finger pricking invasive blood glucose
monitoring for diabetic patients. These tests stem from the Biosensor Platform that we license, across the Asia Pacific Region from
Life Science Biosensor Diagnostics Pty Ltd (“LSBD” or “the Licensor”). The Biosensor Platform is capable of
detecting multiple biological analytes by substituting the GOX enzyme with a suitable alternative for each analyte.
24
Our
objectives:
●
To
expand the IFP product line in drug testing markets concentrating on:
◌
increasing
market share in current markets, which have been the UK and West Europe.
◌
commence
distribution into the Asia region and
◌
commence
the regulatory approval process with the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for the purpose of expanding into the sectors of the USA markets where such approval
is required.
● To complete development
and commercialize the SGB the diagnostic test that stems from the Biosensor Platform that we license from LSBD, in the regions
covered by the license. This will be followed by developing the platform further to testing across the diagnostic modalities of
immunology, hormones, chemistry, tumor markers and nucleic acid tests.
Recent
Developments
Highlights
of our major achievements for the six months ended December 31, 2022, are:
●
The Company completed the acquisition of Intelligent Fingerprinting Limited
(“IFP”), a company registered in England and Wales and on October 4, 2022 (the “IFP Acquisition”). IFP
owns a portfolio of intellectual property for diagnostic tests and associated technologies including drug testing through the analysis
of fingerprint sweat. The acquisition of IFP has expanded the Company’s platform of rapid, non-invasive diagnostic testing technologies.
In connection with the IFP Acquisition, on October 4, 2022, the Company
entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with IFP, the holders of all of the issued shares
in the capital of IFP (collectively, the “IFP Sellers”) and the IFP Sellers’ representative” named therein.
Pursuant
to the Share Exchange Agreement, among other things, the Company acquired from the Sellers all of the issued shares in the capital
of IFP, and as consideration therefor the Company issued and sold to the Sellers upon the closing of the IFP Acquisition (the
“IFP Closing”) an aggregate number of (i) 2,963,091 shares
(148,155 shares post-Reverse Stock
Split)
of the Company’s common stock, and (ii) 2,363,003
shares of the Company’s Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Series C Preferred
Stock”).
Up
to an additional 1,649,273 shares of Series C Preferred Stock have been reserved for potential future issuance by the Company,
consisting of (i) 500,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, , that are being held back from the Sellers for one year after the IFP
Closing
to
secure potential indemnification claims by the Company against the IFP Sellers and (ii) 1,149,273 shares of Series C Preferred Stock
to certain lenders to IFP (the “IFP Lenders”). Each
share of
Series C
Preferred Stock was initially convertible into three shares of Common Stock
(0.15 shares post-Reverse Stock Split)
(subject
to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events), contingent upon approval by the Company’s stockholders.
Each
share of Series C Preferred Stock was initially convertible into three shares of Common Stock (0.15 shares post-Reverse Stock
Split) (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events), contingent upon approval by the Company’s
stockholders.
Also
pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company has an obligation to provide IFP with cash in an amount such that IFP is able to
pay cash payments to certain current and former United Kingdom and United States-based employees and directors (the “IFP Bonus
Recipients”), in aggregate amounts of £239,707 and $83,043, respectively (the “Cash Bonuses”), plus any applicable
employer’s National Insurance contributions. The Cash Bonuses are being paid to the IFP Bonus Recipients in two equal instalments,
with the first payment made immediately following the Closing and the second payment to be made on the six-month anniversary of such
date.
Also
pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company has agreed to make available to the employees of IFP (the “IFP
Employees”) a Company stock option plan in form and substance satisfactory to the Company in relation to up to 1,000,000
shares (50,000 shares post-Reverse Stock Split) Common Stock following the Closing on the basis that an equal number of Company
stock options will be granted to the IFP Employees and Company employees up to an aggregate amount of 2,000,000 (100,000 shares
post-Reverse Stock Split) Company stock options.
Each
of the Company, IFP and the Sellers made certain customary representations and warranties and agreed to certain covenants in the Share
Exchange Agreement.
●
On
July 13, 2022, INBS completed Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved clinical studies at the Diabetes Research Institute of Sutter
Health’s Mills-Peninsula Medical Center (MPMC) in San Mateo, California. The study design was intended to support the clinical
development of its next-generation Saliva Glucose Biosensor. A total of 40 adult subjects with type 2 diabetes were recruited for
the study. Nearly 1,400 samples of blood and oral fluids were collected and analyzed. The subsequent statistical analysis of the
correlation of glucose levels among these sample types will act as foundation for building a robust portfolio of prospective clinical
evidence, forming the backbone for future regulatory submissions.
25
●
We
are continuing to develop our R&D and manufacturing facility at University of Newcastle, Australia. During the quarter, we commenced
the design of the facility and constructions of the facility is expected to start in second quarter of calendar year 2023.
●
During
the quarter, we received and commenced installation of new lab equipment including the Mass Spectrometer and GPC systems, which allows
to improve the specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility of our Biosensor technology.
●
On January 23, 2023, the Company published the results of Milestone 7,
a phase of its biosensor platform development at the University of Newcastle, Australia, that included testing time-to-time (TTR), sensitivity,
and reproducibility. The results showed a record 4x improvement in TTR, enabling the biosensor to return test results in under one minute.
●
On December 21, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement
(the “December 2022 Purchase Agreement”) with 14 investors (the “Series D Investors”), pursuant to which the Company
agreed to issue and sell to the Series D Investors in a Regulation S private placement (the “December 2022 Private Placement”)
(i) 176,462 shares of the Company’s Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Series D Preferred
Stock”), and (ii) 529,386 warrants (the “Series D Warrants”), with each warrant initially representing the right to
purchase one share of common stock (0.05 shares post-Reverse Stock Split). An additional 26,469 warrants were issued to Winx Capital Pty
Ltd., the placement agent for the December 2022 Private Placement, with each warrant initially representing the right to purchase one
share of common stock (0.05 shares post-Reverse Stock Split) (the “Winx Warrants”). The Series D Warrants had an initial exercise
price of $0.29 per share ($5.80 per share post-Reverse Stock Split) (subject to adjustment) and expire June 22, 2028. The Winx Warrants
had an initial exercise price of $0.52 per share ($10.40 per share post-Reverse Stock Split) (subject to adjustment) and expire five years
following the effective date of a registration statement covering the resale of common stock underlying the Series D Preferred Stock acquired
by the Series D Investors. The Series D Preferred Stock and Series D Warrants were sold together as a unit (“Unit”), with
each Unit consisting of one share of Series D Preferred Stock and three Series D Warrants. Each share of Series D Preferred Stock was
initially convertible into three shares of Common Stock (0.15 shares post-Reverse Stock Split) (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence
of specified events). The purchase price for the Units was $1.25 per Unit. The Units offering price and the Series D Warrants exercise
price were priced above the Nasdaq “Minimum Price” as that term is defined in Nasdaq Rule 5635(d)(1). The shares of Series
D Preferred Stock were initially convertible into an aggregate of 529,386 shares (26,470 shares post-Reverse Stock Split) of Common Stock
following shareholder approval of such conversion and without the payment of additional consideration. The December 2022 Private Placement
closed on December 22, 2022. (See Note 21 for information and disclosures relating to adjustments related to the Reverse Stock Split).
●
During the quarter, IFP continued to expand its customer base by entering
sales contract with UK Insulated Glass Manufacturer, Glass Systems, Eastern Airways and Goldstar Transport, the UK’s market-leading
container haulier.
● At the Annual Meeting on February 8, 2023 the stockholders of the Company
approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Amendment”) to effect
the reverse stock split at a ratio of not less than 1-for-2 and not more than 1-for-35 at any time within 12 months following the date
of stockholder approval, with the exact ratio to be set within this range by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”)
at its sole discretion without further approval or authorization of our stockholders.
Pursuant
to such authority granted by the Company’s stockholders, the Board approved a one-for-twenty reverse stock split (the “Reverse
Stock Split”) of the Company’s common stock and the filing of the Amendment to effectuate the Reverse Stock Split. The Amendment
was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Reverse Stock Split became effective in accordance with the terms
of the Amendment at 4:05 p.m. Eastern Time on February 9, 2023 (the “Effective Time”). The Amendment provided that, at the
Effective Time, every 20 shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock automatically combined into one issued
and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in par value per share, which remains $0.01 per share.
As
a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of shares of common stock outstanding was reduced from approximately 18,325,289
shares (excluding treasury shares) as of February 8, 2023, to approximately 916,265 shares (excluding treasury shares, and subject to the rounding up of fractional shares), and
the number of authorized shares of common stock remains 100 million shares. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, proportionate
adjustments were made to the per share exercise price and/or the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or vesting of all
outstanding stock options, restricted stock unit awards and warrants, which will result in a proportional decrease in the number of
shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise or vesting of such stock options, restricted stock
unit awards and warrants, and, in the case of stock options and warrants, a proportional increase in the exercise price of all such
stock options and warrants. In addition, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Company’s 2019 Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time was reduced proportionately.
The
number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Company’s convertible preferred stock, as well as any applicable
conversion prices were also adjusted in proportion to the reverse split ratio of the Reverse Stock Split (subject to adjustment for fractional
interests).
No
fractional shares will be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders of record who would otherwise be entitled to receive
a fractional share are entitled to the rounding up of the fractional share to the nearest whole number. The Reverse Stock Split was
effective at 4:05 p.m., Eastern Time, on February 9, 2023, and the Company’s common stock began trading on a Reverse
Stock Split-adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Capital Market at the open of the markets on February 10, 2023.
Our
Products
Fingerprinting
Drug Screening System (IFP)
Our
recently acquired subsidiary, Intelligent Fingerprinting Limited, Intelligent (IFP), is the developer and owner of a unique and proprietary portable
drug screening system. The system works by analyzing fingerprint sweat using a one-time (recyclable) cartridge and portable handheld
reader. The system is non-invasive, fast, and cost-effective, with sample collection taking seconds with the simultaneous screening for
multiple drug groups in ten minutes. A laboratory confirmation service is also available giving evidential levels of analysis should
this be required. The system has applications within many sectors, and customers include safety-critical industries such as construction,
transportation, and logistics firms, along with drug treatment organizations in the rehabilitation sector, as well as the United Kingdom
(UK) coroners.
The
Intelligent Fingerprinting Drug Screening System consists of a small, tamper-evident Drug Screening Cartridge (for sample collection)
and the portable DSR-Plus, which reads the Cartridge to provide the drug screening results.
26
Intelligent
Fingerprinting offers several fingerprint-based drug screening tests including:
●
DSC2
– testing for Methamphetamine, Methadone, Benzodiazepines, Buprenorphine
●
DSC
5 – testing for Opiates, Cocaine, Cannabis and Methamphetamines
●
DSC
8 – testing for Opiates, Methadone, Buprenorphine and Benzodiazepines
●
DSC
10 – testing for Amphetamine, Opiates, Cannabis and Cocaine
IFP
has developed both a Point of Care drug screening test system (“POCT”) and a drug laboratory-based confirmation testing
service. Both of these involve the collection of fingerprints sweat samples for analysis. For many years, competitor POCT systems
and confirmation tests needed to rely on the collection of either urine or oral fluid (saliva) body fluid samples. There are several
significant benefits of IFP analysis of fingerprint sweat over urine and oral fluid drug testing:
1.
Non-Invasive
sample collection
– Fingerprint sweat can be collected within seconds in any location without the need for specialist trained,
gender-specific collectors or prepared collection areas. The sweat from fingerprints is collected simply by pressing each finger
one by one for five seconds onto a disposable sample collection cartridge. In contrast, the collection of urine and oral fluid samples
can take many hours, requires trained collectors, and to avoid cheating of the tests, the collection areas need to be specially prepared,
and the collection of the sample directly observed, which is clearly extremely invasive and undignified in the case of urine.
2.
Hygienic
and non-biohazardous
– Fingerprint sweat samples are non-biohazardous and so the screening and collection kit material
can be disposed of in routine waste or recycled. Kits used to collect urine and saliva are a potential biohazard and must be treated
as such – either incinerated or into landfill.
3.
Accurate
Results
– The results of conventional urine and oral fluid POCT drug screening tests require reading of the test results
through interpreting the presence or absence of coloured test lines using the naked eye. Often these test lines are weak and difficult
to see, leading to inaccuracy in reading the test result. In contrast the results of the IFP screening test is provided automatically
by the DSR-Plus reader unit. This provides an unambiguous test result that does not require any user interpretation, increasing the
accuracy of the test.
The
combination of these benefits mean that fingerprint drug testing provides a more cost-effective, less invasive and more dignified method
when compared to urine and oral fluid-based tests.
Biosensor
Platform Technology
The
“Biosensor Platform” on which the SGB is based is a modified Organic Thin Film Transistor (OTFT). The OTFT structure consists
of a source and drain electrode, a semiconducting layer, a gate electrode, an optional separation (or dielectric) layer, all printed
on a substrate material and superimposed by a polyelectrolyte membrane/enzyme layer onto which the analyte is placed. The Biosensor Platform
is capable of detecting multiple biological analytes by substituting the GOX enzyme with a suitable alternative for each analyte. The
substitute enzyme will generate an electrical current signal that is detected in a manner identical to the SGB. Our flagship product
candidate from Biosensor Platform Technology is the Saliva Glucose Test (SGT), a POCT expected to substitute the finger pricking invasive
blood glucose monitoring for diabetic patient. Life Science Biosensor Diagnostics Pty Ltd (“LSBD” or Licensor) is an Australian
company that owns the worldwide intellectual property rights to the biosensor platform from University of Newcastle, Australia. LSBD
has licensed to us that technology for us to introduce and launch the platform in the APAC Region.
Our
flagship product candidate from Biosensor Platform Technology is the Saliva Glucose Test (SGT), a POCT expected to substitute the finger
pricking invasive blood glucose monitoring for diabetic patients.
The
Saliva Glucose Test (SGT)
The
SGB uses saliva to measure glucose non-invasively. When the SGB interacts with saliva, an electrochemical reaction is initiated that
produces an electrical signal directly correlated to the amount of glucose present in the saliva. This measurement is then converted
into a real-time saliva glucose reading by a software app on a smart device or a dedicated smart reader for those that do not possess
a compliant and compatible smart device. The reading may then be stored in our proprietary cloud-based digital information system.
27
The
SGT consists of:
●
The
SGB – a single use disposable saliva biosensor, and
●
Software
app on a smart device or a dedicated reader that interfaces the SGB with our digital information system.
The
Saliva Glucose Biosensor (SGB)
The
SGB was invented at the Centre for Organic Electronics (COE) at the University of Newcastle, Australia. Patents for the SGB
technology have been granted in the United States (9,766,199) and China (ZL201380022888.2). The core innovative characteristic of
the SGB is the sensitivity of the glucose biosensor that enables it to detect glucose in saliva at concentrations between 8 and 200
µM and exhibits linear glucose sensing characteristics at these concentrations, sensing glucose at levels 100 times lower than
in blood. In addition to the patent disclosures, details of the SGB design have been published in Applied Physical Letters, a
peer-reviewed physics journal. The Licensor owns patents in Australia, China and the United States protecting the following
technological claims of the SGB: the architecture of a biofunctional organic thin film transistor device comprising a gate
electrode, a dielectric layer, a partially-organic semiconducting layer, a source electrode, a drain electrode, a substrate and an
enzyme; the method for producing the organic thin film transistor device; and the method for determining the concentration of a
compound in a sample by interpreting the amperometric signals generated by the device. The Chinese and the United States patent
belong to the same patent family, originating from the Australian patent. As such, all of the patents relate to identical technology
claims.
The
basic OTFT structure consists of a source and drain electrode on a semiconducting material which is itself separated from a third gate
electrode by a thin insulating layer. The COE has pioneered the fabrication of these novel biosensors based on integrating biomolecules,
such as enzymes, directly into the architecture of organic transistors; producing electronic devices with both high sensitivity and high
specificity for the target analyte. In these biosensors, a molecular recognition element can simply be integrated directly into the device
structure, and in the case of the SGB, the recognition element is GOX.
The
SGB interacts with the glucose in the saliva and initiates an enzymatic reaction whereby GOX enzyme produces hydrogen peroxide from glucose,
which modifies the properties of the OTFT gate material, producing an electrical signal directly correlated to the amount of glucose
present in the saliva. This measurement is then converted into a real-time saliva glucose reading, through the software app installed
on a smart device or a dedicated smart reader. The data may then be transferred to our digital information system coupled with an artificial
intelligence system, which will provide the patient with personalized healthcare advice enabling a practical understanding of lifestyle
factors that may affect their glucose levels.
High
quality OTFTs have been routinely fabricated at the materials node of the Australian National Fabrication Facility. The COE has pioneered
the fabrication of novel biosensors based on integrating biomolecules, such as enzymes, directly into the architecture of organic transistors,
producing electronic devices with both high sensitivity and high specificity for the target analyte and in this case, glucose.
The
development of an intermediate device that communicates to the smart device has been completed. The intermediate device emulates a glucometer,
providing the mechanical and electrical interfaces to receive and power the SGB as well as the required circuitry for accurately reading
the amperometric signals. We intend to transfer the responsibilities of the intermediate device to the SGB.
The
use of saliva as a meaningful proxy for estimating blood glucose level has been reported in scientific literature, including articles
published in independent journals such as the
Journal of Obesity , the
Journal of International Oral Health , the
Journal
of Clinical and Experimental Dentistry , the
Journal of Oral Biology and Craniofacial Research, Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome ,
the
Journal of Biological Regulators and Homeostatic Agents and Diabetologia , among others. However, a few articles have reported
finding little or no significant correlation, including articles in the
Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research
and the
Journal
of Oral Science . Consequently, The company is performing clinical research with the objective to collect and provide the data necessary
to support that saliva can be utilized as a non-invasive alternative to blood to monitor glycemic status in diabetes patients.
28
Other
Tests Based on the Biosensor Platform
As
discussed above, the architecture of the Biosensor Platform allows the recognition element of the biosensor to be exchanged. Accordingly,
the GOX element used to detect glucose in the case of the SGB can be substituted for a different enzyme, cancer biomarkers, immunological
tests, hormones and other biomarkers. The substitute recognition element will catalyze a reaction leading to a signal that is proportional
to the amount of analyte, or participate in a binding reaction of labelled antibodies that will lead to a signal proportional to the
amount of analyte of interest. Given the underlying sensing mechanism is unaltered, we believe the technical risk associated with the
development and manufacturing scale-up of other tests for biomarkers other than glucose is considered to be relatively low.

increased by $91,834 from $177,791 to $269,625 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to same period in 2021. This decrease
was primarily attributable to timing of amount spent on qualifying research and development expenditure for research and development government
subsidies.
29
Government support income in the IFPG and SGBP
segment increased by $403,154 from $177,791 to $580,945 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to same period in 2021.
This increase was primarily attributable to qualifying research and development expenditures incurred during the current period
including the completion of Milestone 7, a phase of its biosensor platform development at the University of Newcastle,
Australia.
The
grant support income is primarily attributable to INBS’s subsidiary companies recognizing R&D tax refund as the Company believes
that it is probable that the certain amount will be recovered in full through a future claim (see Note 3 for further information and disclosures relating R&D tax refund).
Operating
expenses
General
and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses increased by $1,242,045
to $2,245,289 from $1,003,244 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. This is largely due to the
effects of acquisition of IFP, as results of operations of IFP is consolidated in current period from the date of acquisition.
General and administrative expenses increased by $1,359,943 to $3,695,707
from $2,335,764 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. This is largely due to the effects of
acquisition of IFP, as results of operations of IFP is consolidated in current period from the date of acquisition.
As
the Company’s operating activities increase, we expect its general and administrative costs will include additional costs in overhead
contribution, consultancy, as well as an increase in employee related costs associated with a higher headcount.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources
We
use working capital and cash measures to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations.
We define Working Capital as current assets less current liabilities. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for any standardized measure under GAAP. This information is intended to provide investors with information about our liquidity. Other
companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
Since
our inception, our operations have primarily been financed through the issuance of our common stock, redeemable convertible preferred
stock, and the incurrence of debt. As of December 31, 2022, we had $2,911,682 in cash and cash equivalents and $1,563,530 in working
capital.
The Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents
as of December 31, 2022, will be insufficient to allow the Company to fund its current operating plan through at least the next twelve
months from the issuance of these financial statements. These conditions may raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date these financial statements are issued. The Company is currently
evaluating raising additional funds through private placements and or public equity financing. However, there can be no assurance that,
in the event that the Company requires additional financing, such financing will be available on terms which are favorable to us, or at
all. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company received aggregate gross
proceeds of $220,585 (before deducting the placement agent’s fees and the Company’s transaction expenses) in connection
with the closing of the December 2022 Private Placement on December 22, 2022. In the event we require additional capital, there can be
no assurances that we will be able to raise such capital on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to generate sufficient revenues or raise
additional capital through debt or equity financings, or through collaboration agreements, strategic alliances or marketing and distribution
arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our long-term liquidity needs and achieve our intended long-term
business plan. Our failure to obtain such funding when needed could create a negative impact on our stock price or could potentially
lead to a reduction in our operations or the failure of our company. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern.
As a result of the IFP Acquisition,
the Company became the guarantor to unsecured convertible notes (also referred to herein as the IFP Loan Agreements) for which IFP is
the borrower. The outstanding fair value of the convertible notes as of December 31, 2022, was $523,703. The convertible notes, plus certain
accrued interest, will become due on October 4, 2024 (the second anniversary of the IFP Acquisition closing date), unless earlier converted.
The convertible notes bear an interest rate of 17% per annum, on a compounded basis. The interest rate will increase to 22% per annum,
on a compounded basis, on October 4, 2023 (the first anniversary of the IFP Acquisition closing date) if the Company’s shareholders
have not yet approved (i) the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock into common stock and (ii) any amendments to, or adoption of,
any option or warrant plans to give effect to the transactions contemplated under the Share Exchange Agreement.
31
In
the event we require additional capital, there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise such capital on acceptable terms, or
at all. Failure to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional capital through debt or equity financings, or through collaboration
agreements, strategic alliances or marketing and distribution arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet
our long-term liquidity needs and achieve our intended long-term business plan. Our failure to obtain such funding when needed could
create a negative impact on our stock price or could potentially lead to a reduction in our operations or the failure of our company.
Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Extended
Transition Period for “Emerging Growth Companies”
We
have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of
the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates
for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements
may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. Because our financial statements may not be comparable
to companies that comply with public company effective dates, investors may have difficulty evaluating or comparing our business, performance,
or prospects in comparison to other public companies, which may have a negative impact on the value and liquidity of our common stock.
Critical
Accounting Estimates
The
preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions
that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that are not readily apparent from other
sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Business Combinations
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business acquisition
are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired
and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities
acquired also requires management to utilize assumptions and estimates, which are based upon available information that may be subject
to further refinement over the purchase accounting period of one year.
Our
critical accounting policies are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 22, 2022, and the notes
to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in “Part I, Item 1 — Financial Statements” of
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those in our
June 30, 2022, Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 22, 2022.
Recently
issued Accounting Pronouncements
For
the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, see Note 3 to the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included in “Part I, Item 1 — Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q and incorporated herein by reference.
ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this item.
ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure and Control Procedures
Our
management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and have concluded that, based on such evaluation, our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2022 as described below.
32
A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Notwithstanding
the conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report, we
believe that our unaudited condensed financial statements and other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present
fairly, in all material respects, our business, financial condition and results of operations for the interim periods presented.
Material
Weaknesses
As
a result of the assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as
of the evaluation date due to the following material weaknesses in control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information
and communication and monitoring.
The
material weaknesses identified relate to the fact that the Company has not yet designed and maintained an effective control environment
commensurate with its financial reporting requirements, including a) has not yet completed the formally documented policies and procedures
with respect to the review, supervision and monitoring of the Company’s accounting and reporting functions, b) lack of evidence
to support the performance of controls and the adequacy of review procedures, including the completeness and accuracy of information
used in the performance of controls and c) as an emerging growth company we currently have limited accounting personnel and other supervisory
resources necessary to adequately execute the Company’s accounting processes and address its internal controls over financial reporting.
Remediation
Plan
Management
is committed to continuing with the steps necessary to remediate the control deficiencies that constituted the above material weaknesses.
Since the IPO, we made the following enhancements to our control environment:
●
We
added accounting and finance personnel to provide additional individuals to allow for segregation of duties in the preparation and
review of schedules, calculations, and journal entries that support financial reporting, to provide oversight, structure, and reporting
lines, and to provide additional review over our disclosures;
●
We
enhanced our controls to improve the preparation and review over complex accounting measurements, and the application of GAAP to
significant accounts and transactions, and our financial statement disclosures;
●
We
engage independent experts when complex transactions are entered into;
●
We
plan to recruit additional financial reporting and accounting personnel with adequate knowledge of US GAAP and SEC rules; and
●
We
are in the process of engaging outside consultants to assist us in our evaluation of the design, implementation, and documentation
of internal controls that address the relevant risks, and that provide for appropriate evidence of performance of our internal controls
(including completeness and accuracy procedures).
Under
the direction of the audit committee of our board of directors, management will continue to take measures to remediate the material weakness
in the fiscal year 2023. As such, we will continue to enhance corporate oversight over process-level controls and structures to ensure
that there is appropriate assignment of authority, responsibility, and accountability to enable remediation of our material weakness.
As
we continue to evaluate, and work to improve, our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine that additional
measures to address control deficiencies or modifications to the remediation plan are necessary.
33
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Other
than the ongoing remediation effort, described above, there have been no changes to the Company’s internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During the
current quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of IFP. In accordance with the guidance issued by the SEC, recently acquired
businesses may be excluded from management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting in the year of acquisition. Accordingly, management excluded the IFP Acquisition from the management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting from October 4, 2022 (the
acquisition date), which excluded total assets and total net revenue representing approximately 63% & 100% respectively, of the
Company’s related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for quarter ended December 31, 2022.
Inherent
Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls
The
effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including
the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate
misconduct completely. Accordingly, in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any
system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable,
not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits
of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate
for our business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial
reporting.

1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
From
time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently engaged
in any material legal proceedings.

1A. RISK FACTORS.
As
of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 22, 2022, except for risks described below. Any of those risk factors could result in a
significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known
to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors
or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.

We
may not be able to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market in order to maintain the listing of our common
stock.
On
March 17, 2022, the Company received a letter (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock
Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that the minimum closing bid price per share for its common stock was below $1.00
for 30 consecutive business days preceding the date of the Notice, and that the Company did not meet the $1.00 per share minimum bid
price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1).
The
Notice has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
Pursuant
to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company had a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until September 13, 2022 (the “Compliance
Period”), to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirement. The Company was not able to regain compliance
during this Compliance Period. On September 8, 2022, the Company filed a request for a second 180-day period within which to evidence
compliance with the $1.00 bid price requirement following the expiration of the initial compliance period on September 13, 2022. No further
communication has been received from by Nasdaq as at the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
At
our annual meeting of stockholders held on February 8, 2023 (the “Annual Meeting”), the stockholders of the Company approved
an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Amendment”) to effect the reverse
stock split at a ratio of not less than 1-for-2 and not more than 1-for-35 at any time within 12 months following the date of stockholder
approval, with the exact ratio to be set within this range by the Company’s Board at its sole discretion without further approval
or authorization of our stockholders. The primary purpose of the reverse stock split was to increase the per share market price of its
common stock.
Pursuant
to the authority granted by the Company’s stockholders, the Board approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock
Split”) of the Company’s common stock and the filing of the Amendment to effectuate the Reverse Stock Split. The Amendment
was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Reverse Stock Split became effective in accordance with the terms
of the Amendment at 4:05 p.m. Eastern Time on February 9, 2023, and the Company’s common stock began trading on a Reverse Stock
Split-adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Capital Market at the open of the markets on February 10, 2023.
Although
the Reverse Stock Split brought the price of our common stock back above $1.00 per share in order to meet the requirements for the continued
listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that the closing bid price of our common stock will
remain at or above $1.00 for 10 consecutive business days, whether following the Reverse Stock Split or otherwise, which is required
to cure our current Nasdaq listing standard deficiency. If we fail to satisfy the Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements, Nasdaq
may take steps to delist our common stock, which could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds as well
as the price and liquidity of our common stock.
Our
Licensor is undergoing equity recapitalization the outcome with which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s
ability to use IP rights for the Licensed Products, as well as our business, financial condition and operating
results
We are party to a Technology
License Agreement (the “Technology License Agreement”) with Life Science Biosensor Diagnostics Pty Ltd. (“LSBD”),
pursuant to which, among other things, the Company licenses certain products from LSBD (the “Licensed Products”), and have
a 50% interest in BiosensX (North America) Inc which has exclusive license to use, make, sell and offer to sell products under the intellectual
property rights in connection with the Biosensor technology the glucose/diabetes management field in the United States, Mexico and Canada.
According to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission’s (ASIC’s), Companies and Organizations Register, on May
10, 2022, LSBD filed a Notice of Appointment of External Administrator, followed by a filing of a Deed of Company Arrangement on the August
2, 2022. We understand that LSBD is proposing to undergo a recapitalization of its equity structure on or before February 28, 2023. We
understand, the deed administrators granted a further extension from December 5, 2022, to February 28, 2023, to the Deed Proponents to
complete their due diligence. The terms of such recapitalization or other outcome of such administration of LSBD could result in, among
other things, change in control of the Licensor or more parties other than LSBD becoming the owner of the Intellectual Property (IP) rights.
Accordingly, this has an inherent risk of the possibility of modifications to, or the Company’s ability to use, the Licensed Products,
which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results.
