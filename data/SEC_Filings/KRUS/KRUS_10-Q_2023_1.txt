Kura Sushi USA, Inc.
Notes to Conden sed Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
Note 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation Kura Sushi USA, Inc. is a technology-enabled Japanese restaurant concept that provides guests with a distinctive dining experience by serving authentic Japanese cuisine through an engaging revolving sushi service model, which the Company refers to as the “Kura Experience.” Kura Sushi encourages healthy lifestyles by serving freshly prepared Japanese cuisine using high-quality ingredients that are free from artificial seasonings, sweeteners, colorings, and preservatives. Kura Sushi aims to make quality Japanese cuisine accessible to its guests across the United States through affordable prices and an inviting atmosphere. “Kura Sushi USA,” “Kura Sushi,” “Kura,” and the “Company” refer to Kura Sushi USA, Inc. unless expressly indicated or the context otherwise requires. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements (the “Condensed Financial Statements”) have been prepared by the Company in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. As such, these Condensed Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022.
The accounting policies followed by the Company are set forth in Part II, Item 8, Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state the Condensed Financial Statements have been made. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2023 or for any other future annual or interim period. Fiscal Year The Company’s fiscal year begins on September 1 and ends on August 31, and references made to “fiscal year 2023” and “fiscal year 2022” refer to the Company’s fiscal years ending August 31, 2023 and ended August 31, 2022, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. Significant items subject to such estimates include asset retirement obligations, stock-based compensation, the useful lives of assets, the assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets, and income taxes. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors and adjusts those estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions. Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Comprehensive income (loss) is the same as net income (loss) for all periods presented. Therefore, a separate statement of comprehensive income (loss) is not included in the accompanying financial statements. 5
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement In November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance,” which provides guidance on disclosures for transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this update effective
September 1, 2022. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

Note 4. Related Party Transactions Kura Sushi, Inc. (“Kura Japan”) is the majority shareholder of the Company and is incorporated and headquartered in Japan.

In addition, the Company has agreed to continue to provide Kura Japan with certain translational support services, and market research. In exchange for such services, supplies, parts and equipment, the parties pay fees to each other as set forth under the Shared Services Agreement.

Note 6. Debt On April 10, 2020, the Company and Kura Japan entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, establishing a $ 45.0
million revolving credit line for the Company. The maturity date for each advance is 60 months from the date of disbursement and the last day of the period of availability for advances is April 10, 2025. The Revolving Credit Note under the Revolving Credit Agreement has an interest rate for advances fixed at 130% of the Annual Compounding Long-Term Applicable Federal Rate (“AFR”) on the date such advance is made. There are no financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement with which the Company must comply.
As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, the Company had
no
o utstanding balance and $ 45.0
million of availability remaining under the Revolving Credit Agreement. For additional information, see “Note 4. Related Party Transactions.”
Note 7 . Loss Per Share The net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock as if the income for the year has been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights for Class A and Class B common stock are identical, the net loss attributable to all common stockholders is allocated on a proportionate basis. 10
The following table sets forth the computation of the Company’s basic and diluted net loss per share:

The Company computes basic loss per common share using net loss and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and computes diluted loss per common share using net loss and the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares include dilutive outstanding employee stock options and restricted stock units. For the three months ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, there were
708
thousand
and
623
thousand
shares of common stock subject to outstanding employee stock options and restricted stock units that were excluded from the calculation of diluted income per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies
On May 31, 2019, a putative class action complaint was filed by a former employee, Brandy Gomes, in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleging violations of California wage and hour laws. On July 9, 2020, plaintiff’s counsel filed a first amended class action complaint to add Jamar Spencer, another former employee, as a plaintiff to this action. In addition, the first amended class action complaint added new causes of action alleging violations of California wage and hour laws including a cause of action brought under the California Private Attorney General Act. On August 7, 2020, the Company filed its answer to the first amended complaint, generally denying the allegations in the complaint. In May 2021, a joint stipulation was filed requesting a delay in the class certification hearing date to March 3, 2022, and a mediation was scheduled for September 24, 2021. During the mediation, a settlement was agreed upon in the amount of
$ 1.75
million. Th e Company recorded an accrued liability of
$ 1.78
million, i ncluding an estimated
$ 30
thousand in em ployer payroll taxes, related to this settlement within general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021.
The court granted final approval of the settlement on November 18, 2022. In December 2022, pursuant to the court’s order granting final approval of the settlement, the Company deposited $ 1.78
million into an account controlled by a settlement administrator for disbursement to class participants and other parties to the litigation. A final report regarding the distribution of settlement funds is due on July 6, 2023, and a non-appearance case review is scheduled for July 13, 2023. The Company is involved from time to time in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to commercial disputes, environmental matters, employee related claims, intellectual property disputes and litigation in connection with transactions including acquisitions and divestitures. In the opinion of management, the Company does not believe that such litigation, claims, and administrative proceedings, excluding the putative class action matter referenced above, will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims or an increase in amounts owing under successful claims, including the putative class action referenced above, could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company records a liability when a loss is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 11
Note 9. Income Taxes The Company recorded an income tax expense of
$ 10
thousand
and
$ 12
thousand
for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rates for the three months ended November 30, 2022
substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of
21 % primarily due to a valuation allowance for the Company’s deferred tax assets.
The Company continually monitors and performs an assessment of the realizability of its deferred tax assets, including an analysis of factors such as future taxable income, reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considered both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets using a “more likely than not” standard. In making such assessment, more weight was given to evidence that could be objectively verified, including recent cumulative losses. Based on the Company’s review of this evidence, management determined that a full valuation allowance against all of the Company’s net deferred tax assets at November 30, 2022
was appropriate.
Note 10. Subsequent Event On December 28, 2022, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Registration Statement”) with the SEC in accordance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Registration Statement registers Class A common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, subscription rights, share purchase contracts, share purchase units, and any combination of the foregoing, for a maximum aggregate offering price of up to $ 125.0
million, which may be sold from time to time, subject to the Registration Statement being declared effective by the SEC. The terms of any securities offered under the Registration Statement and intended use of proceeds will be established at the times of the offerings and will be described in prospectus supplements filed with the SEC at the times of the offerings. The Registration Statement has a three-year term once declared effective by the SEC.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited financial statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the audited financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 (the “Annual Report”).
In addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements,
such as statements about our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions, which are based on current expectations and that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions as set forth and described in the “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” sections of the Annual Report .
You should review those sections in our Annual Report for a discussion of important factors, including the continuing development of our business and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
“Kura Sushi USA,” “Kura Sushi,” “Kura,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company” and the “Company” refer to Kura Sushi USA, Inc. unless expressly indicated or the context otherwise requires.
Overview
Kura Sushi USA is a technology-enabled Japanese restaurant concept that provides guests with a distinctive dining experience by serving authentic Japanese cuisine through an engaging revolving sushi service model, which we refer to as the “Kura Experience.” We encourage healthy lifestyles by serving freshly prepared Japanese cuisine using high-quality ingredients that are free from artificial seasonings, sweeteners, colorings, and preservatives. We aim to make quality Japanese cuisine accessible to our guests across the United States through affordable prices and an inviting atmosphere.
Business Trends
We have experienced inflationary pressures affecting our operations in certain areas such as food and beverage costs, labor costs, construction costs and energy costs. We have also experienced temporary shortages in food, equipment and other goods, as well as an increase in freights costs, due in part to supply chain impacts of overall economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. We have been able to offset to some extent these inflationary and other cost pressures through various actions, such as increasing menu prices, productivity improvements, and supply chain initiatives, however, we expect these inflationary and other cost pressures to continue throughout the remainder of fiscal year 2023.
Key Financial Definitions
Sales.
Sales represent sales of food and beverages in restaurants. Restaurant sales in a given period are directly impacted by the number of restaurants we operate and comparable restaurant sales performance.
Food and beverage costs.
Food and beverage costs are variable in nature, change with sales volume and are influenced by menu mix and subject to increases or decreases based on fluctuations in commodity costs. Other important factors causing fluctuations in food and beverage costs include seasonality and restaurant-level management of food waste. Food and beverage costs are a substantial expense and are expected to grow proportionally as our sales grow.
Labor and related expenses.
Labor and related expenses include all restaurant-level management and hourly labor costs, including wages, employee benefits and payroll taxes. Similar to the food and beverage costs that we incur, labor and related expenses are expected to grow proportionally as our sales grow. Factors that influence fluctuations in our labor and related expenses include minimum wage and payroll tax legislation, the frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims, healthcare costs and the performance of our restaurants.
Occupancy and related expenses.
Occupancy and related expenses include rent for all restaurant locations and related taxes.
Depreciation and amortization expenses.
Depreciation and amortization expenses are periodic non-cash charges that consist of depreciation of fixed assets, including equipment and capitalized leasehold improvements. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years.
13
Other costs.
Other costs include credit card processing fees, repairs and maintenance, restaurant-level advertising and promotions, restaurant supplies, royalty payments to Kura Japan, stock-based compensation for restaurant-level employees, utilities and other restaurant-level expenses.
General and administrative expenses.
General and administrative expenses include expenses associated with corporate and regional supervision functions that support the operations of existing restaurants and development of new restaurants, including compensation and benefits, travel expenses, stock-based compensation for corporate-level employees, legal and professional fees, marketing costs, information systems, corporate office rent and other related corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expected to grow as our unit base grows.
Interest expense.
Interest expense includes cash and non-cash charges related to our line of credit and finance lease obligations.
Interest income.
Interest income includes income earned on our money market funds.
Income tax expense (benefit).
Provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local current and deferred income tax (benefit) expense.

Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 Compared to Three Months Ended November 30, 2021
Sales.
Sales were $39.3 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 compared to $29.8 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021, representing an increase of $9.5 million, or 31.8%. Comparable restaurant sales increased 6.9% for the three months ended November 30, 2022, as compared to the three months ended November 30, 2021. The increase in sales was primarily driven by the sales resulting from nine new restaurants opened subsequent to November 30, 2021, as well as increases in menu prices during the same period.
Food and beverage costs.
Food and beverage costs were $12.4 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 compared to $9.0 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021, representing an increase of $3.4 million, or 38.8%. The increase in food and beverage costs was primarily driven by costs associated with sales from nine new restaurants opened subsequent to November 30, 2021. As a percentage of sales, food and beverage costs increased to 31.6% in the three months ended November 30, 2022 as compared to 30.0% in the three months ended November 30, 2021, primarily due to food cost inflation partially offset by increases in menu prices.
Labor and related costs.
Labor and related costs were $12.5 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 compared to $9.7 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021, representing an increase of $2.8 million, or 29.1%. This increase in labor and related costs was primarily driven by additional labor costs incurred from nine new restaurants opened subsequent to November 30, 2021. As a percentage of sales, labor and related costs decreased to 31.9% in the three months ended November 30, 2022 as compared to 32.5% in the three months ended November 30, 2021. The decrease in cost as a percentage of sales was primarily
due to increases in menu prices and technological initiatives, partially offset by increases in wages rates and incremental pre-opening labor.
15
Occupancy and related expenses.
Occupancy and related expenses were $2.9 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 compared to $2.2 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021, representing an increase of $0.7 million, or 31.1%. The increase was primarily a result of additional lease expense related to the opening of nine new restaurants subsequent to November 30, 2021. As a percentage of sales, occupancy and related expenses decreased to 7.3% in the three months ended November 30, 2022 as compared to 7.4% in the three months ended November 30, 2021, primarily driven by leverage benefits from the increase in sales.
Depreciation and amortization expenses.
Depreciation and amortization expenses incurred as part of restaurant operating costs were $1.6 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 compared to $1.2 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021, representing an increase of $0.4 million, or 34.6%. The increase was primarily due to depreciation of property and equipment related to the nine new restaurants opened subsequent to November 30, 2021. As a percentage of sales, depreciation and amortization expenses at the restaurant level increased to 4.0% in the three months ended November 30, 2022 as compared to 3.9% in the three months ended November 30, 2021. Depreciation and amortization expenses incurred at the corporate level were $0.1 million for both the three months ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, and as a percentage of sales were 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.
Other costs.
Other costs were $5.3 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 compared to $3.6 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021, representing an increase of $1.7 million, or 47.4%. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in costs related to nine new restaurants opened subsequent to November 30, 2021. As a percentage of sales, other costs increased to 13.5% in the three months ended November 30, 2022 as compared to 12.1% in the three months ended November 30, 2021, primarily driven by increases in pre-opening costs, advertising and promotional costs and repair and maintenance costs.
General and administrative expenses.
General and administrative expenses were $6.6 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022 compared to $5.4 million for the three months ended November 30, 2021, representing an increase of $1.2 million, or 23.9%. This increase was primarily due to increases in compensation related costs of $1.4 million due to additional headcount and $0.2 million in travel expenses, offset by reductions of $0.2 million in recruiting costs and $0.2 million in legal fees, insurance and other costs. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses decreased to 16.9% in the three months ended November 30, 2022 from 18.0% in the three months ended November 30, 2021, primarily driven by leverage benefits from the increase in sales.
Interest expense.
Interest expense was $16 thousand for the three months ended November 30, 2022 compared to $25 thousand for the three months ended November 30, 2021.
Interest income.
Interest income was $94 thousand for the three months ended November 30, 2022 compared to $26 thousand for the three months ended November 30, 2021.
Income tax expense.
Income tax expense was $10 thousand for the three months ended November 30, 2022 compared to $12 thousand for the three months ended November 30, 2021. For further discussion of our income taxes, see “Note 9. Income Taxes” in the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements.
Key Performance Indicators
In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial and performance measures. The key measures for determining how our business is performing include sales, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-level Operating Profit, Restaurant-level Operating Profit margin, Average Unit Volumes (“AUVs”), comparable restaurant sales performance, and the number of restaurant openings.
Sales
Sales represents sales of food and beverages in restaurants, as shown on our statements of operations. Several factors affect our restaurant sales in any given period, including the number of restaurants in operation, guest traffic and average check.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, non-cash lease expense and asset disposals, closure costs and restaurant impairments, that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP measures which are intended as supplemental measures of our performance and are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and operating results. However, these measures may not
16
provide a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company as a whole and such measures should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial results.
We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in the same fashion.
Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
The following table reconciles net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:

(a) Stock-based compensation expense includes non-cash stock-based compensation, which is comprised of restaurant-level stock-based compensation included in other costs and of corporate-level stock-based compensation included in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations. For further details of stock-based compensation, see “Note 5. Stock-based Compensation” in the notes to condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
(b) Non-cash lease expense includes lease expense from the date of possession of our restaurants that did not require cash outlay in the respective periods.
Restaurant-level Operating Profit and Restaurant-level Operating Profit Margin
Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) is defined as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; pre-opening costs and general and administrative expenses which are considered normal, recurring, cash operating expenses
and are essential to support the development and operations of our restaurants; non-cash lease expense; asset disposals, closure costs and restaurant impairments; less corporate-level stock-based compensation expense recognized within general and administrative expenses. Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) margin is defined as Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) divided by sales. Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) and Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) margin non-GAAP measures which are intended as supplemental measures of our performance and are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) and Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) margin provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and operating results, as this measure depicts normal, recurring cash operating expenses essential to supporting the development and operations of our restaurants. However, these measures may not provide a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company as a whole and such measures should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial results. We expect Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) to increase in proportion to the number of new restaurants we open and our comparable restaurant sales growth.
17
We present Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) because it excludes the impact of general and administrative expenses, which are not incurred at the restaurant level. We also use Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) to measure operating performance and returns from opening new restaurants. Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) margin allows us to evaluate the level of Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) generated from sales.
However, you should be aware that Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) and Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) margin are financial measures which are not indicative of overall results for the Company, and Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) and Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) margin do not accrue directly to the benefit of stockholders because of corporate-level expenses excluded from such measures.
In addition, when evaluating Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) and Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) margin, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) and Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) margin may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) and Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) margin in the same fashion. Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) and Restaurant-level Operating Profit (Loss) margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

Comparable Restaurant Sales Performance
Comparable restaurant sales performance refers to the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable restaurant base. We include restaurants in the comparable restaurant base that have been in operation for at least 18 months prior to the start of the accounting period presented due to new restaurants experiencing a period of higher sales upon opening, including those temporarily closed for renovations during the year. For restaurants that were temporarily closed for renovations during the year, we make fractional adjustments to sales such that sales are annualized in the associated period.
Measuring our comparable restaurant sales performance allows us to evaluate the performance of our existing restaurant base. Various factors impact comparable restaurant sales, including:
• consumer recognition of our brand and our ability to respond to changing consumer preferences;
• overall economic trends, particularly those related to consumer spending;
• our ability to operate restaurants effectively and efficiently to meet consumer expectations;
• pricing;
• guest traffic;
• per-guest spend and average check;
• marketing and promotional efforts;
• local competition; and
• opening of new restaurants in the vicinity of existing locations.
Since opening new restaurants will be a significant component of our sales growth, comparable restaurant sales performance is only one measure of how we evaluate our performance. The following table shows the comparable restaurant sales performance:

Number of Restaurant Openings
The number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular reporting period. Before we open new restaurants, we incur pre-opening costs. New restaurants may not be profitable, and their sales performance may not follow historical patterns. The number and timing of restaurant openings has had, and is expected to continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. The following table shows the
growth in our restaurant base:

Subsequent to November 30, 2022, we opened one new restaurant in Philadelphia, PA.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary uses of cash are for operational expenditures and capital investments, including new restaurants, costs incurred for restaurant remodels and restaurant fixtures.
On December 28, 2022, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Registration Statement”) with the SEC in accordance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Registration Statement registers Class A common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, subscription rights, share purchase contracts, share purchase units, and any combination of the foregoing, for a maximum aggregate offering price of up to $125.0 million, which may be sold from time to time, subject to the Registration Statement being declared effective by the SEC. The terms of any securities offered under the Registration Statement and intended use of proceeds will be established at the times of the offerings and will be described in
19
prospectus supplements filed with the SEC at the times of the offerings. The Registration Statement has a three-year term once declared effective by the SEC.
During the three months ended November 30, 2022, we had no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement and have $45.0 million of availability remaining. As of November 30, 2022, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.
The significant components of our working capital are liquid assets such as cash, cash equivalents and receivables, reduced by accounts payable and accrued expenses. Our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to guests the same day or, in the case of credit or debit card transactions, within several days of the related sale, while we typically have longer payment terms with our vendors.
We believe that cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and availability under our existing Revolving Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund our lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least the next 12 months.
Summary of Cash Flows
Our primary sources of liquidity and cash flows are operating cash flows and cash on hand. We use this to fund investing expenditures for new restaurant openings, reinvest in our existing restaurants, and increase our working capital. Our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to guests the same day, or in the case of credit or debit card transactions, within several days of the related sale, and we typically have at least 30 days to pay our vendors.

Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended November 30, 2022 was $0.5 million, which results from a net loss of $2.1 million, non-cash charges of $1.7 million for depreciation and amortization, $0.7 million for stock-based compensation, and $0.8 million in non-cash lease expense, and net cash outflows of $0.5 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Net cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended November 30, 2021 was $10.6 million, which results from a net loss of $1.3 million offset by non-cash charges of $1.3 million for depreciation and amortization, $0.4 million for stock-based compensation, and $0.7 million in non-cash lease expense, and net cash inflows of approximately $9.4 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily the result of $8.3 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, $0.1 million in accounts and other receivables, an increase of $0.2 million in operating lease liabilities and $0.3 million in due from our affiliate Kura Japan. The change in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the receipt of employee retention credits under the CARES Act extension during the three months ended November 30, 2021.
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended November 30, 2022 was $9.3 million, primarily due to $8.3 million in purchases of property and equipment and $0.8 million in purchases of liquor licenses. The purchases of property and equipment in the three months ended November 30, 2022 is primarily related to capital expenditures for current and future restaurant openings and renovations, maintaining our existing restaurants and other projects.

Net cash used in financing activities during the three months ended November 30, 2021 was $0.2 million and is primarily due to $0.3 million in repayments of principal on finance leases.
Material Cash Requirements
As of November 30, 2022, we had $7.5 million in contractual obligations relating to the construction of new restaurants and purchase commitments for goods related to restaurant operations. All contractual obligations are expected to be paid during the fiscal year 2023 utilizing cash and cash equivalents on hand and provided by operations. For operating and finance lease obligations, see “Note 3. Leases” in the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For a description of our recently adopted accounting pronouncement, including the respective date of adoption and expected effect on our results of operations and financial condition, see “Part I, Item 1, Note 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation” of the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of operating results and financial condition are based upon our financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.
Our critical accounting policies are those that materially affect our financial statements. Our critical accounting estimates are those that involve subjective or complex judgments by management. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future, actual results may be materially different from the estimates. We believe the assessment of potential impairments of long-lived assets is
affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and that the judgments and estimates are reasonable.
There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022. Please refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” of our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.
21
Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, we are also eligible for and intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of that fiscal year, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.235 billion during such fiscal year (as indexed for inflation), (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in the prior three-year period or (iv) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk.
Commodity and Food Price Risks
Our profitability is dependent on, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and beverages and other commodities. We have been able to
partially offset cost increases resulting from a number of factors, including market conditions, shortages or interruptions in supply due to weather or other conditions beyond our control, governmental regulations, and inflation, by increasing our menu prices, as well as making other operational adjustments that increase productivity. However, substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be offset by menu price increases or operational adjustments.
Inflation Risk
The primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food and beverage costs, labor costs, construction costs and energy costs. Our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state minimum wage and other laws governing such matters as working conditions, overtime and tip credits. Significant numbers of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates related to the federal and/or state minimum wage and, accordingly, increases in the minimum wage increase our labor costs. To the extent permitted by competition and the economy, we have mitigated increased costs by increasing menu prices and may continue to do so if deemed necessary in future years. Substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases cannot be passed through to our guests. Historically, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations, although inflationary pressures have increased across our business, including with respect to food and beverage costs, due in part to supply chain impacts of overall economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. Severe increases in inflation, however, could affect the global and U.S. economies and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
While we have been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of core operating resources by gradually increasing menu prices, coupled with more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greater economies of scale, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. From time to time, competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility. In addition, macroeconomic conditions could make additional menu price increases imprudent. There can be no assurance that future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our guests without any resulting change to their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will generate the same sales growth in an amount sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures.
Item 4. Controls
and Procedures.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
