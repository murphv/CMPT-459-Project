U-Haul Holding Company and consolidated subsidiaries
notes to condensed consolidated financial statements
1.Basis of Presentation
U-Haul Holding Company, a Nevada corporation formerly known as AMERCO (“U-Haul Holding Company”), has a third fiscal quarter that ends on the 31st of December for each year that is referenced. Our insurance company subsidiaries have a third quarter that ends on the 30
th
of September for each year that is referenced. They have been consolidated on that basis. Our insurance companies’ financial reporting processes conform to calendar year reporting as required by state insurance departments. Management believes that consolidating their calendar year into our fiscal year financial statements does not materially affect the presentation of financial position or results of operations. We disclose material events, if any, occurring during the intervening period. Consequently, all references to our insurance subsidiaries’ years 2022 and 2021 correspond to fiscal 2023 and 2022 for U-Haul Holding Company.
Accounts denominated in non-U.S. currencies have been translated into U.S. dollars.
The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, and the related condensed consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022 and cash flows for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022 are unaudited.
In our opinion, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of such condensed consolidated financial statements have been included. Such adjustments consist only of normal recurring items. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Quarterly Report”) should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

2. Earnings per Share
We calculate earnings per share using the two-class method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 260,
Earnings Per Share
. The two-class method allocates the undistributed earnings available to common stockholders to the Company’s outstanding common stock, $
0.25
par value (the “Voting Common Stock”) and the Series N Non-Voting Common Stock, $
0.001
par value (the “Non-Voting Common Stock”) based on each share’s percentage of total weighted average shares outstanding. The Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock are allocated
10
% and
90
%, respectively, of our undistributed earnings available to common stockholders. This represents earnings available to common stockholders less the dividends declared for both the Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock.
Our undistributed earnings per share is calculated by taking the undistributed earnings available to common stockholders and dividing this number by the weighted average shares outstanding for the respective stock. If there was a dividend declared for that period, the dividend per share is added to the undistributed earnings per share to calculate the basic and diluted earnings per share. The process is used for both Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock.

We sold available-for-sale securities with a fair value of $
147.6
million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and $
352.3
million for the full year of fiscal 2022. The gross realized gains on these sales totaled $
1.1
million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and $
9.5
million for the full year of fiscal 2022. The gross realized losses on these sales totaled $
0.5
million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and $
1.4
million for the full year of fiscal 2022.
For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether the security is below investment grade. For securities that are below investment grade, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors such as the interest rate environment. Declines in value due to credit quality are recognized as an allowance. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse market conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, cumulative default rates based on ratings are used to determine the potential cost of default, by year. The present value of these potential costs is then compared to the amortized cost of the security to determine the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis.
Declines in fair value that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses, such as declines due to changes in market interest rates, are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. If we intend to sell a security, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the security is written down to its fair value and the write down is charged against the allowance for credit losses, with any incremental impairment reported in earnings. Reversals of the allowance for credit losses are permitted and should not exceed the allowance amount initially recognized.

(a) Certain loans have interest rate swaps fixing the rates between 2.72% and 2.86% based on current margins.
Real Estate Backed Loans
Real Estate Loans
Certain subsidiaries of Real Estate and U-Haul Company of Florida are borrowers under real estate loans. These loans require monthly or quarterly principal and interest payments, with the unpaid loan balance and accrued and unpaid interest due at maturity. These loans are secured by various properties owned by the borrowers. The interest rates, per the provisions of $
208.5
million of these loans, are the applicable Secured Overnight Funding Rate (“SOFR”) plus the applicable margins and a credit spread adjustment of
0.10
%. As of December 31, 2022, the applicable SOFR was between
3.79
% and
4.12
% and applicable margin was between
0.65
% and
1.38
%, the sum of which, including the credit spread, was between
4.54
% and
5.60
%. The remaining $
84.2
million of these loans was fixed with an interest rate of
4.29
%. The default provisions of these real estate loans include non-payment of principal or interest and other standard reporting and change-in-control covenants.
Senior Mortgages
Various subsidiaries of Real Estate and U-Haul are borrowers under certain senior mortgages. The senior mortgages require monthly principal and interest payments. The senior mortgages are secured by certain properties owned by the borrowers. The fixed interest rates, per the provisions of the senior mortgages, range between
2.70 % and
5.50 %. The weighted average interest rate of these loans as of December 31, 2022 was
4.09 %.
Certain senior mortgages have an anticipated repayment date and a maturity date. If these senior mortgages are not repaid by the anticipated repayment date, the interest rate on these mortgages would increase from the current fixed rate. We are using the anticipated repayment date for our maturity schedule. Real Estate and U-Haul have provided limited guarantees of the senior mortgages. The default provisions of the senior mortgages include non-payment of principal or interest and other standard reporting and change-in-control covenants. There are limited restrictions regarding our use of the funds.

U-Haul Holding Company and consolidated subsidiaries
notes to condensed consolidated financial statements – (continued)
Real Estate Loan (Revolving Credit)
U-Haul Holding Company is a borrower under a real estate loan. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum credit commitment is $
465.0
million. As of December 31, 2022, the full capacity was available to borrow. This loan agreement provides for revolving loans, subject to the terms of the loan agreement. This loan requires monthly interest payments with the unpaid loan balance and accrued and unpaid interest due at maturity. The default provisions of the loan include non-payment of principal or interest and other standard reporting and change-in-control covenants. There is a
0.30
% fee charged for unused capacity. This loan was amended in October 2022 and the maximum credit limit was increased from $
150
million to $
465
million, the maturity extended to October 2027 and LIBOR based rates were replaced with SOFR based rates.
Fleet Loans
Rental Truck Amortizing Loans
The amortizing loans require monthly principal and interest payments, with the unpaid loan balance and accrued and unpaid interest due at maturity. These loans were used to purchase new trucks. The interest rates, per the provision of the loan agreements, are carried at fixed rates ranging between
1.61
% and
5.68
%.
All of our rental truck amortizing loans are collateralized by the rental equipment purchased.
The majority of these loans are funded at 70%, but some may be funded at 100%.
U-Haul Holding Company, and in some cases U-Haul, is guarantor of these loans. The default provisions of these loans include non-payment of principal or interest and other standard reporting and change-in-control covenants.
Rental Truck Revolvers
Various subsidiaries of U-Haul entered into three revolving fleet loans with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $
615.0
million. The aggregate outstanding balance for these revolvers as of December 31, 2022 was $
615.0
million. The interest rates, per the provision of the loan agreements, are SOFR plus the applicable margin and a credit spread adjustment of
0.10
%. As of December 31, 2022,
SOFR was between
3.70
% and
4.12
% and the margin was between
1.15
% and
1.25
%, the sum of which, including the credit spread, was between
4.95
% and
5.44
%. Of the $
615.0
million outstanding, $
100.0
million was fixed with an interest rate of
2.36
%. Only interest is paid on the loans until the last nine months of the respective loan terms when principal becomes due monthly.
Finance Leases
The Finance Lease balance represents our sale-leaseback transactions of rental equipment. The agreements are generally
seven (7) year terms
with interest rates ranging from
2.16
% to
5.04
%.
All of our finance leases are collateralized by our rental fleet. The net book value of the corresponding rental equipment was $
504.6
million and $
620.8
million as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. There were no new financing leases, as assessed under the new leasing guidance, entered into during the first nine months of fiscal 2023.
Finance Liabilities
Finance liabilities represent our rental equipment financing transactions, and we assess if these sale-leaseback transactions qualify as a sale at initiation by determining if a transfer of ownership occurs.
We have determined that our equipment sale-leasebacks do not qualify as a sale, as the buyer-lessors do not obtain control of the assets in our ongoing sale-leaseback arrangements. As a result, these sale-leasebacks are accounted for as a financial liability and the leased assets are capitalized at cost.
Our finance liabilities have an average term of
seven (7) years
and interest rates ranging from
1.60 % to
5.98 %. These finance liabilities are collateralized by the related assets of our rental fleet.   The net book value of the corresponding rental equipment was $ 1,399.5
million and $ 1,068.3
million as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.

5. Derivatives
We manage exposure to changes in market interest rates. Our use of derivative instruments is limited to highly effective interest rate swaps to hedge the risk of changes in cash flows (future interest payments) attributable to changes in SOFR swap rates with the designated benchmark interest rate being hedged on certain of our SOFR indexed variable rate debt.
The interest rate swaps effectively fix our interest payments on certain SOFR indexed variable rate debt through July 2032. We monitor our positions and the credit ratings of our counterparties and do not currently anticipate non-performance by the counterparties. Interest rate swap agreements are not entered into for trading purposes.
These fair values are determined using pricing valuation models which include broker quotes for which significant inputs are observable. They include adjustments for counterparty credit quality and other deal-specific factors, where appropriate and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The derivative fair values reflected in prepaid expense and accounts payable and accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheet were as follows:

million and $ 0.1
million, respectively, net of taxes. During the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, we reclassified $ 0.1
million and $ 2.3
million, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) to interest expense, net of tax. As of December 31, 2022, we expect to reclassify $ 2.3

These contracts earn a return for the contractholder based on the change in the value of the S&P 500 index between annual index point dates. We buy and sell listed equity and index call options and call option spreads. The credit risk is with the party in which the options are written. The net option price is paid up front and there are no additional cash requirements or additional contingent liabilities. These contracts are held at fair value on our balance sheet. These derivative instruments are included in Investments, other, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Net (gains) losses recognized in net investment and interest income for the third quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were $
1.4
million and $
0.1
million, respectively and $
9.2
million and ($
1.8
) million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. The fair values of these call options are determined based on quoted market prices from the relevant exchange and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.

Although the call options are employed to be effective hedges against our policyholder obligations from an economic standpoint, they do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Accordingly, the changes in fair value of the call options are recognized each reporting date as a component of net investment and interest income. The change in fair value of the call options include the gains or losses recognized at the expiration of the option term and the changes in fair value for open contracts.

Background of the Independent Special Committee
The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) created an Independent Special Committee (the “Committee”) to consider various matters and actions. The Committee retained outside advisors to help examine multiple options aimed at enhancing the marketability and liquidity of the Company’s stock.

The Committee approved the following actions.

Dividend Policy for Non-Voting Common Stock
In response to the Committee’s recommendation to consider a dividend policy, the Board adopted a dividend policy for the new Non-Voting Common Stock.
Unless the Board in its sole discretion determines otherwise, it shall be the policy of the Company to declare and pay a quarterly cash dividend on each share of the Company’s Non-Voting Common Stock, in the amount of $

9. Contingencies
Cybersecurity Incident
On September 9, 2022, we announced that the Company was made aware of a data security incident involving U-Hauls information technology network. U-Haul detected a compromise of two unique passwords used to access U-Haul customers‘ information. U-Haul took immediate steps to contain the incident and promptly enhanced its security measures to prevent any further unauthorized access. U-Haul retained cybersecurity experts and incident response counsel to investigate the incident and implement additional security safeguards. The investigation determined that between November 5, 2021 and April 8, 2022, the threat actor accessed customer contracts containing customers’ names, dates of birth, and driver’s license or state identification numbers. None of U-Haul’s financial, payment processing or email systems were involved. U-Haul has notified impacted customers and relevant governmental authorities.
Several class action lawsuits related to the incident have been filed against U-Haul. The lawsuits have been consolidated into one action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona and will be vigorously defended by the Company, however the outcome of such lawsuits cannot be predicted or guaranteed with any certainty.
Environmental
Compliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments may significantly affect Real Estate’s business operations. Among other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. Real Estate is aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of its properties. Real Estate regularly makes capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws and has put in place a remedial plan at each site where it believes such a plan is necessary.
Based upon the information currently available to Real Estate, compliance with the environmental laws and its share of the costs of investigation and cleanup of known hazardous waste sites are not expected to result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
Other
We are named as a defendant in various other litigation and claims arising out of the normal course of business, including various class actions related to the Company’s cybersecurity incident described above. In management’s opinion, none of these other matters will have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.

10. Related Party Transactions
As set forth in the Company’s Audit Committee Charter and consistent with the NYSE Listed Company Manual, our Audit Committee (the “Audit Committee”) reviews and maintains oversight over related party transactions, which are required to be disclosed under the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules and regulations and in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, all such related party transactions are submitted to the Audit Committee for ongoing review and oversight. Our internal processes are designed to ensure that our legal, accounting and finance departments identify and monitor potential related party transactions that may require disclosure and Audit Committee oversight.
U-Haul Holding Company has engaged in related party transactions and has continuing related party interests with certain major stockholders, directors and officers of the consolidated group as disclosed below.
SAC Holding Corporation and SAC Holding II Corporation (collectively “SAC Holdings”) were established in order to acquire and develop self-storage properties. These properties are being managed by us pursuant to management agreements. SAC Holdings, Four SAC Self-Storage Corporation, Five SAC Self-Storage Corporation, Galaxy Investments, L.P. and 2015 SAC Self-Storage, LLC are substantially controlled by Blackwater Investments, Inc. (“Blackwater”). Blackwater is wholly owned by Willow Grove Holdings LP, which is owned by Mark V. Shoen (a significant stockholder), and various trusts associated with Edward J. Shoen (our Chairman of the Board, President and a significant stockholder) and Mark V. Shoen.

We currently manage the self-storage properties owned or leased by Blackwater and Mercury Partners, L.P. (“Mercury”), pursuant to a standard form of management agreement, under which we receive a management fee of between
4 % and
10 % of the gross receipts plus reimbursement for certain expenses. We received management fees, exclusive of reimbursed expenses, of $ 24.9
million and $ 27.1
million from the above-mentioned entities during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The decrease in management fees received in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2022 was due to a timing difference of the incentive fee of $ 4.0
million being paid in March of fiscal 2022. This management fee is consistent with the fee received for other properties we previously managed for third parties. Mark V. Shoen controls the general partner of Mercury. The limited partner interests of Mercury are owned indirectly by James P. Shoen (is the brother of Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen) and various trusts benefitting Edward J. Shoen and James P. Shoen or their descendants.
Mercury holds the option to purchase a portfolio of properties currently leased by Mercury and a U-Haul subsidiary, which option is exercisable in 2024.

These agreements with subsidiaries of Blackwater, excluding Dealer Agreements, provided revenues of $
22.7
million and $

14. Fair Value Measurements
Certain assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are measured and classified based upon a three-tiered approach to valuation. Financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value and are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
Level 2 – Quoted prices for identical or similar financial instruments in markets that are not considered to be active, or similar financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means; and
Level 3 – Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and are unobservable. These reflect management’s assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.
A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Fair values of cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to the short period of time to maturity. Fair values of short-term investments, investments available-for-sale, long-term investments, mortgage loans and notes on real estate, and interest rate swap contracts are based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. Fair values of trade receivables approximate their recorded value.

U-Haul Holding Company and consolidated subsidiaries
notes to condensed consolidated financial statements – (continued)
Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, trade receivables, reinsurance recoverables and notes receivable. Limited credit risk exists on trade receivables due to the diversity of our customer base and their dispersion across broad geographic markets. We place our temporary cash investments with financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
We have mortgage receivables, which potentially expose us to credit risk. The portfolio of notes is principally collateralized by self-storage facilities and commercial properties. We have not experienced any material losses related to the notes from individual or groups of notes in any particular industry or geographic area. The estimated fair values were determined using the discounted cash flow method and using interest rates currently offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings.
Other investments, including short-term investments, are substantially current or bear reasonable interest rates. As a result, the carrying values of these financial instruments approximate fair value.
The carrying values and estimated fair values for the financial instruments stated above and their placement in the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

15. Revenue Recognition
Revenue Recognized in Accordance with Topic 606
ASC Topic 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , outlines a five-step model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The standard applies to all contracts with customers except for leases, insurance contracts, financial instruments, certain nonmonetary exchanges and certain guarantees. The standard also requires disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments.

U-Haul Holding Company and consolidated subsidiaries
notes to condensed consolidated financial statements – (continued)
We enter into contracts that may include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of amounts collected from customers for taxes, such as sales tax, and remitted to the applicable taxing authorities. We account for a contract under Topic 606 when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For contracts scoped into this standard, revenue is recognized when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied by means of transferring goods or services to the customer as applicable to each revenue stream as discussed below. There were no material contract assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022.
Sales of self-moving and self-storage related products are recognized at the time that title passes and the customer accepts delivery. The performance obligations identified for this portfolio of contracts include moving and storage product sales, installation services and/or propane sales. Each of these performance obligations has an observable stand-alone selling price. We concluded that the performance obligations identified are satisfied at a point in time. The basis for this conclusion is that the customer does not receive the product/propane or benefit from the installation services until the related performance obligation is satisfied. These products/services being provided have an alternative use as they are not customized and can be sold/provided to any customer. In addition, we only have the right to receive payment once the products have been transferred to the customer or the installation services have been completed. Although product sales have a right of return policy, our estimated obligation for future product returns is not material to the financial statements at this time.
Property management fees are recognized over the period that agreed-upon services are provided. The performance obligation for this portfolio of contracts is property management services, which represents a series of distinct days of service, each of which is comprised of activities that may vary from day to day. However, those tasks are activities to fulfill the property management services and are not separate promises in the contract. We determined that each increment of the promised service is distinct. This is because the customer can benefit from each increment of service on its own and each increment of service is separately identifiable because no day of service significantly modifies or customizes another and no day of service significantly affects either the entity’s ability to fulfill another day of service or the benefit to the customer of another day of service. As such, we concluded that the performance obligation is satisfied over time. Additionally, in certain contracts the Company has the ability to earn an incentive fee based on operational results. We measure and recognize the progress toward completion of the performance obligation on a quarterly basis using the most likely amount method to determine an accrual for the incentive fee portion of the compensation received in exchange for the property management service. The variable consideration recognized is subject to constraints due to a range of possible consideration amounts based on actual operational results. The amount accrued in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 did not have a material effect on our financial statements.
Other revenue consists of numerous services or rentals, of which U-Box contracts and service fees from Moving Help are the main components. The performance obligations identified for U-Box contracts are fees for rental, storage and shipping of U-Box containers to a specified location, each of which are distinct. A contract may be partially within the scope of Topic 606 and partially within the scope of other topics. The rental and storage obligations in U-Box contracts meet the definition of a lease in Topic 842, while the shipping obligation represents a contract with a customer accounted for under Topic 606. Therefore, we allocate the total transaction price between the performance obligations of storage fees and rental fees and the shipping fees on a standalone selling price basis. U-Box shipping fees are collected once the shipment is in transit. Shipping fees in U-Box contracts are set at the initiation of the contract based on the shipping origin and destination, and the performance obligation is satisfied over time. U-Box shipping contracts span over a relatively short period of time, and the majority of these contracts begin and end within the same fiscal year. Moving Help services fees are recognized in accordance with Topic 606. Moving Help services are generated as we provide a neutral venue for the connection between the service provider and the customer for agreed upon services. We do not control the specified services provided by the service provider before that service is transferred to the customer.

Revenue Recognized in Accordance with Topic 842
The Company’s self-moving rental revenues meet the definition of a lease pursuant to the guidance in Topic 842 because those substitution rights do not provide an economic benefit to the Company that would exceed the cost of exercising the right.
Please see Note 8, Leases, of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Self-moving rentals are recognized over the contract period that trucks and moving equipment are rented. We offer two types of self-moving rental contracts, one-way rentals and in-town rentals, which have varying payment terms. Customer payment is received at the initiation of the contract for one-way rentals which covers an allowable limit for equipment usage. An estimated fee in the form of a deposit is received at the initiation of the contract for in-town rentals, and final payment is received upon the return of the equipment based on actual fees incurred. The contract price is estimated at the initiation of the contract, as there is variable consideration associated with ratable fees incurred based on the number of days the equipment is rented and the number of miles driven. Variable consideration is estimated using the most likely amount method which is based on the intended use of the rental equipment by the customer at the initiation of the contract. Historically, the variability in estimated transaction pricing compared to actual is not significant due to the relatively short duration of rental contracts. Each performance obligation has an observable stand-alone selling price. The input method of passage of time is appropriate as there is a direct relationship between our inputs and the transfer of benefit to the customer over the life of the contract. Self-moving rental contracts span a relatively short period of time, and the majority of these contracts began and ended within the same fiscal year.
Self-storage revenues are recognized as earned over the contract period based upon the number of paid storage contract days.
We lease portions of our operating properties to tenants under agreements that are classified as operating leases. We recognize the total minimum lease payments provided for under the leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Generally, under the terms of our leases, the majority of our rental expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, are recovered from our customers.
The following table summarizes the minimum lease payments due from our customers and operating property tenants on leases for the next five years and thereafter:

Revenue Recognized in Accordance with Other Topics
Traditional life and Medicare supplement insurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the premium-paying periods of the contracts when due from the policyholders. For products where premiums are due over a significantly shorter duration than the period over which benefits are provided, such as our single premium whole life product, premiums are recognized when received and excess profits are deferred and recognized in relation to the insurance in force.
Property and casualty insurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the policy periods. Interest and investment income are recognized as earned.

.
We recognized liabilities resulting from contracts with customers for self-moving equipment rentals, self-storage revenues, U-Box revenues and tenant revenues, in which the length of the contract goes beyond the reported period end, although rental periods of the equipment, storage and U-Box contract are generally short-term in nature. The timing of revenue recognition results in liabilities that are reflected in deferred income on the balance sheet.

16. Allowance for Credit Losses
Trade Receivables
Moving and Storage has two (
2
) primary components of trade receivables, receivables from corporate customers and credit card receivables from customer sales and rental of equipment.
For credit card receivables, the Company uses a trailing 13 months average historical chargeback percentage of total credit card receivables to estimate a credit loss reserve. The Company rents equipment to corporate customers in which payment terms are 30 days.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and assesses each customer’s credit worthiness. In addition, the Company monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains an allowance based upon applying an expected credit loss rate to receivables based on the historical loss rate from similar high risk customers adjusted for current conditions, including any specific customer collection issues identified, and forecasts of economic conditions. Delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is remote.
Management believes that the historical loss information it has compiled is a reasonable base on which to determine expected credit losses for trade receivables because the composition of trade receivables as of that date is consistent with that used in developing the historical credit loss percentages (i.e., the similar risk characteristics of its customers and its lending practices have not changed signiﬁcantly over time).
To adjust the historical loss rates to reﬂect the eﬀects of these diﬀerences in current conditions and forecasted changes, management assigns a rating to each corporate customer which varies depending on the assessment of risk. Management estimated the loss rate at approximately
4
% and
6
% as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Management developed this estimate based on its knowledge of past experience for which there were similar improvements in the economy. As a result, management applied the applicable credit loss rates to determine the expected credit loss estimate for each aging category. Accordingly, the allowance for expected credit losses as of December 31, 2022, was $
4.0
million.
Accrued Interest Receivable
Accrued interest receivables on available for sale securities totaled $
29.6
million as of September 30, 2022 and are excluded from the estimate of credit losses.
As outlined in subtopic 326-20-30-5A, we have elected not to measure an allowance on accrued interest receivables as our practice is to write off the uncollectible balance in a timely manner. Furthermore, we have elected to write off accrued interest receivables by reversing interest income (in accordance with subtopic 326-20-35-8A).
Mortgage loans, net
Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff, are reported at amortized cost.
Modeling for the Company‘s mortgage loans is based on inputs most highly correlated to defaults, including loan-to-value, occupancy, and payment history.
Historical credit loss experience provides additional support for the estimation of expected credit losses. In assessing the credit losses, the portfolio is reviewed on a collective basis, using loan-specific cash flows to determine the fair value of the collateral in the event of default.
Adjustments to this analysis are made to assess loans with a loan-to-value of 65% or greater.
These loans are evaluated on an individual basis and loan specific risk characteristics such as occupancy levels, expense, income growth and other relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
When management determines that credit losses are expected to occur, an allowance for expected credit losses based on the fair value of the collateral is recorded.
Reinsurance recoverables
Reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid benefits was less than
1 % of the total assets as of September 30, 2022 which is immaterial based on historical loss experience and high credit rating of the reinsurers.

Accounting Pronouncements
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2018-12,
Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts
(“ASU 2018-12”). The amendments in this update require insurance companies to annually review and update the assumptions used for measuring the liability under long-duration contracts, such as life insurance, disability income, and annuities. The amendment prescribes standardized liability discount rate, consistency in measurement of market risk benefits, simplified amortization of deferred acquisition costs and enhanced disclosures. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 31, 2020. In November 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-11,
Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944)
, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2018-12 to years beginning after December 15, 2022. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2018-12 on our financial statements; however, the adoption of ASU 2018-12 will impact the statements of operations because the effect of any update to the assumptions we used at the inception of the contracts will be recorded in net income.
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or the SEC that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, these ASUs entail technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance related to specialized industries or entities and therefore will have minimal, if any, impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption.

Item 2.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
General
We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) with the overall strategy of U-Haul Holding Company (formally known as AMERCO), followed by a description of, and strategy related to, our operating segments to give the reader an overview of the goals of our businesses and the direction in which our businesses and products are moving. We then discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. Next, we discuss our results of operations for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, compared with the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2022, which is followed by an analysis of liquidity changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and a discussion of our financial commitments in the sections entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources - Summary and Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. We conclude this MD&A by discussing our current outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023.
This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Quarterly Report, including the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements, as discussed under the caption, Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks described throughout this filing or in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control and our actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
U-Haul Holding Company, a Nevada corporation, has a third fiscal quarter that ends on the 31st of December for each year that is referenced. Our insurance company subsidiaries have a third quarter that ends on the 30th of September for each year that is referenced. They have been consolidated on that basis. Our insurance companies’ financial reporting processes conform to calendar year reporting as required by state insurance departments. Management believes that consolidating their calendar year into our fiscal year financial statements does not materially affect the presentation of financial position or results of operations. We disclose material events, if any, occurring during the intervening period. Consequently, all references to our insurance subsidiaries’ years 2022 and 2021 correspond to fiscal 2023 and 2022 for U-Haul Holding Company.

Cybersecurity Incident
On September 9, 2022, we announced that the Company was made aware of a data security incident involving U-Hauls information technology network. U-Haul detected a compromise of two unique passwords used to access U-Haul customers‘ information. U-Haul took immediate steps to contain the incident and promptly enhanced its security measures to prevent any further unauthorized access. U-Haul retained cybersecurity experts and incident response counsel to investigate the incident and implement additional security safeguards. The investigation determined that between November 5, 2021 and April 8, 2022, the threat actor accessed customer contracts containing customers’ names, dates of birth, and driver’s license or state identification numbers. None of U-Haul’s financial, payment processing or email systems were involved. U-Haul has notified impacted customers and relevant governmental authorities.
Several class action lawsuits related to the incident have been filed against U-Haul. The lawsuits have been consolidated into one action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona and will be vigorously defended by the Company; however the outcome of such lawsuits cannot be predicted or guaranteed with any certainty.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Impairment of Investments
Under the current expected credit loss model, a valuation allowance is recognized in earnings for credit losses. If we intend to sell a debt security, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the debt security is written down to its fair value and the write down is charged against the allowance for credit losses, with any incremental impairment reported in
earnings. Reversals of the allowance for credit losses are
permitted and should not exceed the allowance amount initially recognized.
There was a $2.2 million net impairment charge associated with this allowance recorded for the first nine months ended December 31, 2022.

Self-moving equipment rental revenues decreased $76.7 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Transactions and revenue for both our In-Town and one-way markets decreased.
Compared to the same period last year, we increased the number of retail locations, independent dealers, trucks, and trailers in the rental fleet.
Self-storage revenues increased $31.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
The average monthly number of occupied units increased by 12%, or 57,229 units, during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the same period last year.
The growth in revenues and square feet rented comes from a combination of occupancy gains at existing locations, the addition of new capacity to the portfolio and from an improvement in average revenue per occupied foot.
Over the last twelve months, we added approximately 6.2 million net rentable square feet, with approximately 1.7 million of that coming on during the third quarter of fiscal 2023.
Sales of self-moving and self-storage products and services decreased $0.6 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily due to a decrease in the sale of moving supplies.
Life insurance premiums decreased $2.6 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022 due primarily to decreased sales of single premium life products and policy decrements in Medicare supplement premiums.
49
Property and casualty insurance premiums increased $1.2 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022. A significant portion of Repwest’s premiums are from policies sold in conjunction with U-Haul rental transactions. The premium increase corresponded with the increased moving and storage transactions at U-Haul during July, August and September.
Net investment and interest income increased $21.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Increased yields on government securities were the primary cause of the $23.7 million increase for Moving and Storage.
Partially offsetting this increase were changes in the market value of unaffiliated equity stocks held at our Property and Casualty Insurance subsidiary which accounted for a $2.3 million decrease.
Other revenue decreased $2.9 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily coming from decreased moving transactions within our U-Box
®
program.

There are many factors that could affect our liquidity, including some of which are beyond our control, and there is no assurance that future cash flows and liquidity resources will be sufficient to meet our outstanding debt obligations and our other future capital needs.
As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents totaled $2,510.6 million, compared with $2,704.1 million as of March 31, 2022. The assets of our insurance subsidiaries are generally unavailable to fulfill the obligations of non-insurance operations (Moving and Storage). As of December 31, 2022 (or as otherwise indicated), cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets (receivables, short-term investments, other investments, fixed maturities, and related party assets) and debt obligations of each operating segment were:

(a) As of September 30, 2022
As of December 31, 2022, Moving and Storage had additional cash available under existing credit facilities of $465.0 million.
The majority of invested cash at the Moving and Storage segment is held in government money market funds.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $273.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2022. The decrease was primarily due to reduced net earnings of $151.3 million and the payment of $78.0 million in federal income tax in fiscal 2023 compared with the receipt of $243 million of federal income tax refunds in fiscal 2022.
58
Net cash used in investing activities increased $424.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, compared with the first six months of fiscal 2022. Purchases of property, plant and equipment increased $423.4 million. Reinvestment in the rental fleet was less than our projection due to delays in receiving new equipment from our original equipment manufacturers during the first nine months of fiscal 2023; however, the level of reinvestment in the rental fleet has increased in comparison to the first nine months of fiscal 2022.
Cash from the sales of property, plant and equipment increased $49.8 million largely due to fleet sales. For our insurance subsidiaries, net cash used in investing activities decreased $188.2 million due to a decrease in purchases in fixed maturity investments, which was offset by a $225.0 million increase in purchases of short-term Treasury notes by Moving and Storage.
Net cash provided by financing activities decreased $621.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, as compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2022. This was due to a combination of increased debt payments of $361.9 million, decreased finance lease repayments of $33.9 million, a decrease in cash from borrowings of $226.4 million and a decrease in net annuity deposits from Life Insurance of $72.5 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources and Requirements of Our Operating Segments
Moving and Storage
To meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Capital expenditures have primarily consisted of new rental equipment acquisitions and the buyouts of existing fleet from leases. The capital to fund these expenditures has historically been obtained internally from operations and the sale of used equipment and externally from debt and lease financing. U-Haul estimates that during fiscal 2023, the Company will reinvest in its rental equipment fleet approximately $625 million, net of equipment sales and excluding any lease buyouts. Through the first nine months of fiscal 2023, the Company invested, net of sales, approximately $489 million before any lease buyouts in its rental equipment fleet. Fleet investments in fiscal 2023 and beyond will be dependent upon several factors including the availability of capital, the truck rental environment, the availability of equipment from our original equipment manufacturers and the used-truck sales market. We anticipate that the fiscal 2023 investments will be funded largely through debt financing, external lease financing and cash from operations. Management considers several factors including cost and tax consequences when selecting a method to fund capital expenditures. Our allocation between debt and lease financing can change from year to year based upon financial market conditions which may alter the cost or availability of financing options.
The Company has traditionally financed the acquisition of self-storage properties to support U-Haul's growth through debt financing and funds from operations. The Company’s plan for the expansion of owned storage properties includes the acquisition of existing self-storage locations from third parties, the acquisition and development of bare land, and the acquisition and redevelopment of existing buildings not currently used for self-storage.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2023, the Company invested $1,003.2 million in real estate acquisitions, new construction and renovation and repair. For fiscal 2023, the timing of new projects will be dependent upon several factors, including the entitlement process, availability of capital, weather, and the identification and successful acquisition of target properties. U-Haul's growth plan in self-storage also includes the expansion of the U-Haul Storage Affiliate program, which does not require significant capital.
59
Net capital expenditures (purchases of property, plant and equipment less proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and lease proceeds) were $1,545.9 million and $1,169.2 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Moving and Storage continues to hold significant cash and has access to additional liquidity. Management may invest these funds in our existing operations, expand our product lines or pursue external opportunities in the self-moving and storage marketplace or reduce existing indebtedness where possible.
Property and Casualty Insurance
State insurance regulations restrict the amount of dividends that can be paid to stockholders of insurance companies. As a result, Property and Casualty Insurance’s assets are generally not available to satisfy the claims of U-Haul Holding Company or its legal subsidiaries.
We believe that stockholders’ equity at Property and Casualty Insurance remains sufficient, and we do not believe that its ability to pay ordinary dividends to U-Haul Holding Company will be restricted per state regulations.
Property and Casualty Insurance’s stockholder’s equity was $281.3 million and $296.1 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease resulted from net earnings of $19.8 million, and a decrease in other comprehensive income of $34.6 million due to the decrease in the market value of its investment portfolio. Property and Casualty Insurance does not use debt or equity issues to increase capital and therefore has no direct exposure to capital market conditions other than through its investment portfolio.
Life Insurance
Life Insurance manages its financial assets to meet policyholder and other obligations, including investment contract withdrawals and deposits. Life Insurance’s net deposits for the nine months as of September 30, 2022 were $21.3 million. State insurance regulations restrict the amount of dividends that can be paid to stockholders of insurance companies. As a result, Life Insurance’s assets are generally not available to satisfy the claims of U-Haul Holding Company or its legal subsidiaries.
Life Insurance’s stockholder’s equity was $141.2 million and $440.9 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease resulted from net earnings of $6.6 million, and a decrease in other comprehensive income of $306.3 million primarily due to the effect of interest rate changes on the fixed maturity portion of the investment portfolio.
Outside of its membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) system, Life Insurance has not historically used debt or equity issues to increase capital and therefore has not had any significant direct exposure to capital market conditions other than through its investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2022, Oxford had outstanding deposits of $60.0 million in the FHLB.
For a more detailed discussion of this deposit, please see Note 4, Borrowings, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cash Provided from Operating Activities by Operating Segments
Moving and Storage
Net cash provided from operating activities were $1,419.0 million and $1,698.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to reduced net earnings of $151.3 million and the payment of $78.0 million in federal income tax in fiscal 2023 compared with the receipt of $243 million of federal income tax refunds in fiscal 2022.
60
Property and Casualty Insurance
Net cash provided by operating activities were $30.2 million and $23.1 million for the first nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was the result of changes in intercompany balances and the timing of payables activity.
Property and Casualty Insurance’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolios amounted to $33.8 million and $41.7 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. These balances reflect funds in transition from maturity proceeds to long-term investments. Management believes this level of liquid assets, combined with budgeted cash flow, is adequate to meet foreseeable cash needs. Capital and operating budgets allow Property and Casualty Insurance to schedule cash needs in accordance with investment and underwriting proceeds.
Life Insurance
Net cash provided by operating activities were $66.5 million and $67.2 million for the first nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to a decrease in investment and premium income only partially offset by a decrease in benefits, commissions, and federal income taxes.
In addition to cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, a substantial amount of liquid funds are available through Life Insurance’s short-term portfolio and its membership in the FHLB. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments amounted to $60.2 million and $50.1 million, respectively. Management believes that the overall sources of liquidity are adequate to meet foreseeable cash needs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources - Summary
We believe we have the financial resources needed to meet our business plans, including our working capital needs. We continue to hold significant cash and have access to existing credit facilities and additional liquidity to meet our anticipated capital expenditure requirements for investment in our rental fleet, rental equipment and storage acquisitions and build outs.
As a result of the federal income tax provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, we have filed applicable forms with the Internal Revenue Service to carryback net operating losses.
These refund claims total approximately $366 million, of which we have received approximately $243 million and are reflected in Prepaid expense. These amounts are expected to provide us additional liquidity whenever received. It is possible future legislation could negatively impact our ability to receive these tax refunds.
Our borrowing strategy has primarily focused on asset-backed financing, rental equipment leases and private placement borrowings limited by the amount of unencumbered assets available. As part of this strategy, we seek to ladder maturities and fix interest rates. While each of these loans typically contains provisions governing the amount that can be borrowed in relation to specific assets, the overall structure is flexible with no limits on overall Company borrowings. Management believes it has adequate liquidity between cash and cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity in existing credit facilities to meet the current and expected needs of the Company over the next several years. As of December 31, 2022, we had available borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities of $465.0 million. It is possible that circumstances beyond our control could alter the ability of the financial institutions to lend us the unused lines of credit. We believe that there are additional opportunities for leverage in our existing capital structure. For a more detailed discussion of our long term debt and borrowing capacity, please see Note 4, Borrowings, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
Our estimates as to future contractual obligations have not materially changed from the disclosure included under the subheading Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.
61
Fiscal 2023 Outlook
We will continue to focus our attention on increasing transaction volume and improving pricing, product and utilization for self-moving equipment rentals. Maintaining an adequate level of new investment in our truck fleet is an important component of our plan to meet our operational goals and is likely to increase in fiscal 2023.
Revenue in the U-Move
®
program could be adversely impacted should we fail to execute in any of these areas. Should we be unable to acquire enough new rental equipment to properly rotate our fleet, repair and maintenance costs will continue to increase.
Even if we execute our plans, we could see declines in revenues primarily due to unforeseen events including adverse economic conditions or heightened competition that is beyond our control.
With respect to our storage business, we have added new locations and expanded existing locations. In fiscal 2023, we are actively looking to complete current projects, increase occupancy in our existing portfolio of locations and acquire new locations. New projects and acquisitions will be considered and pursued if they fit our long-term plans and meet our financial objectives. It is likely spending on acquisitions and new development will increase in fiscal 2023. We will continue to invest capital and resources in the U-Box
®
program throughout fiscal 2023.
Inflationary pressures may challenge our ability to maintain or improve upon our operating margin.
Property and Casualty Insurance will continue to provide loss adjusting and claims handling for U-Haul and underwrite components of the Safemove

Life Insurance is pursuing its goal of expanding its presence in the senior market through the sales of its Medicare supplement, life and annuity policies. This strategy includes growing its agency force, expanding its new product offerings, and pursuing business acquisition opportunities.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To mitigate these risks, we may utilize derivative financial instruments, among other strategies. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Interest Rate Risk
The exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate debt obligations and one variable rate operating lease. We have used interest rate swap agreements and forward swaps to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates. We enter into these arrangements with counterparties that are significant financial institutions with whom we generally have other financial arrangements. We are exposed to credit risk should these counterparties not be able to perform on their obligations. Following is a summary of our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2022:

1 Month SOFR
As of December 31, 2022, we had $823.5 million of variable rate debt obligations. If SOFR were to increase 100 basis points, the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by $6.2 million annually (after consideration of the effect of the above derivative contracts). Certain senior mortgages have an anticipated repayment date and a maturity date. If these senior mortgages are not repaid by the anticipated repayment date, the interest rate on these mortgages would increase from the current fixed rate. We are using the anticipated repayment date for our maturity schedule.
62
Additionally, our insurance subsidiaries’ fixed income investment portfolios expose us to interest rate risk. This interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates. As part of our insurance companies’ asset and liability management, actuaries estimate the cash flow patterns of our existing liabilities to determine their duration. These outcomes are compared to the characteristics of the assets that are currently supporting these liabilities assisting management in determining an asset allocation strategy for future investments that management believes will mitigate the overall effect of interest rates.
We use derivatives to hedge our equity market exposure to indexed annuity products sold by our Life Insurance company. These contracts earn a return for the contractholder based on the change in the value of the S&P 500 index between annual index point dates. We buy and sell listed equity and index call options and call option spreads. The credit risk is with the party in which the options are written. The net option price is paid up front and there are no additional cash requirements or additional contingent liabilities. These contracts are held at fair market value on our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, these derivative hedges had a net market value of $2.2 million and $7.5 million, with notional amounts of $456.4 million and $416.7 million, respectively. These derivative instruments are included in Investments, other, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Although the call options are employed to be effective hedges against our policyholder obligations from an economic standpoint, they do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under GAAP. Accordingly, the call options are marked to fair value on each reporting date with the change in fair value, plus or minus, included as a component of net investment and interest income. The change in fair value of the call options includes the gains or losses recognized at the expiration of the option term and the changes in fair value for open contracts.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
The exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our Canadian business. Approximately 5.2% of our revenue was generated in Canada during each of the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and 2022. The result of a 10.0% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar would not be material to net income. We typically do not hedge any foreign currency risk since the exposure is not considered material.
Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report contains “forward-looking statements” regarding future events and our future results of operations. We may make additional written or oral forward-looking statements from time to time in filings with the SEC or otherwise. We believe such forward-looking statements are within the meaning of the safe-harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Such statements may include, but are not limited to, the risk associated with COVID-19 or similar events on employees or customers; impact on the economic environment or demand of our products and the cost and availability of debt and capital; estimates of capital expenditures; plans for future operations, products or services, financing needs plans and strategies; our perceptions of our legal positions and anticipated outcomes of government investigations and pending litigation against us; liquidity and the availability of financial resources to meet our needs, goals and strategies; plans for new business, storage occupancy, growth rate assumptions, pricing, costs, and access to capital and leasing markets; the impact of our compliance with environmental laws and cleanup costs; our beliefs regarding our sustainable practices; our used vehicle disposition strategy; the sources and availability of funds for our rental equipment and self-storage expansion and replacement strategies and plans; our plan to expand our U-Haul storage affiliate program; that additional leverage can be supported by our operations and business; the availability of alternative vehicle manufacturers; our estimates of the residual values of our equipment fleet; our plans with respect to off-balance sheet arrangements; our plans to continue to invest in the U-Box ®
program; the impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate changes on our operations; the sufficiency of our capital resources; the sufficiency of capital of our insurance subsidiaries; inflationary pressures that may challenge our ability to maintain or improve upon our operating margin; expectations regarding the potential impact to our information technology infrastructure and on our financial performance and business operations, including any related costs, fines or lawsuits, and our ability to continue ongoing operations and safeguard the integrity of our information technology infrastructure, data, and employee customer and vendor information, as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “estimate,” “project” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made.
63
Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified. Factors that could significantly affect results include, without limitation, the degree and nature of our competition; our leverage; general economic conditions; fluctuations in our costs to maintain and update our fleet and facilities; the limited number of manufacturers that supply our rental trucks; our ability to effectively hedge our variable interest rate debt; that we are controlled by a small contingent of stockholders; fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality; changes in, and our compliance with, government regulations, particularly environmental regulations and regulations relating to motor carrier operations; outcomes of litigation; our reliance on our third party dealer network; liability claims relating to our rental vehicles and equipment; our ability to attract, motivate and retain key employees; reliance on our automated systems and the internet; our credit ratings; our ability to recover under reinsurance arrangements and other factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in this Quarterly Report or the other documents we file with the SEC. The above factors, as well as other statements in this Quarterly Report and in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, could contribute to or cause such risks or uncertainties, or could cause our stock price to fluctuate dramatically. Consequently, the forward-looking statements should not be regarded as representations or warranties by us that such matters will be realized. We assume no obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, unforeseen events, changed circumstances or otherwise, except as required by law.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Attached as exhibits to this Quarterly Report are certifications of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act. This "Controls and Procedures" section includes information concerning the controls and procedures evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented in the section titled Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) (“Disclosure Controls”) as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report. Our Disclosure Controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Our Disclosure Controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our Disclosure Controls were not effective due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.
An error was identified in the implementation of the accounting for the two-class method of earnings per share associated with the recently issued UHAL.B common stock.
The error arose during the preparation of the Form 10-Q and was due to our untimely review of the matter in connection with our financial reporting process, which constitutes a material weakness.
Our remediation process includes, but is not limited to, enhancing the design of controls relevant to the preparation and presentation of financial reporting matters; and evaluating applicable personnel to ensure appropriate knowledge and experience. We believe that these actions will remediate the material weakness. The weakness will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate, and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.
Notwithstanding such material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, our management, including our CEO and our CFO, have concluded that our consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of our operations and our cash flows for the periods presented in this Quarterly Report, in conformity with GAAP.
64
Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of our controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Other than the material weakness described above, there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
PART II Other information
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
The information regarding our legal proceedings in Note 9, Contingencies, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
We refer you to documents filed by us with the SEC, specifically “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, which identify important risk factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. We also refer you to the factors and cautionary language set forth in the section entitled “Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in our MD&A of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with such risks and other factors for a full understanding of our operations and financial conditions. The risks described in our Form 10-K and herein are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
The trading price for our outstanding Voting Common Stock may continue to be volatile and the trading price for our newly distributed Series N Non-Voting Common Stock may also be volatile.
An Independent Special Committee of the Board of Directors authorized the creation of a new Series of Common Stock, designated as Series N Non-Voting Common Stock, par value of $0.001 per share (the “Non-Voting Common Stock”). This series of stock is in addition to our pre-existing class of common stock, $0.25 par value (the “Voting Common Stock”). On November 9, 2022, each holder of our Voting Common Stock as of November 3, 2022 received nine shares of Non-Voting Common Stock for every outstanding share of Voting Common Stock through a stock dividend.
The Non-Voting Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, a liquid trading market will develop long-term for the Non-Voting Common Stock. If a liquid trading market does not develop or if the Non-Voting Common Stock is not attractive to retail investors, including team members and customers of the Company, we may not achieve our objectives in creating this new class.
65
The trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile, including as a result of the distribution of shares of Non-Voting Common Stock. The market prices of our two series of stock and the allocation of value between the two may be volatile and their respective values may decline. The trading price of our Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:
•
Quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors.
•
Announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments.
•
Recommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates.
•
Announcements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations.
•
Announcements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations.
•
Commentary by industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and other matters affecting our business and results, regardless of its accuracy.
•
The volume of shares of Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock available for public sale.
•
Sales of Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock by us or by our stockholders (including sales by our directors, executive officers, and other employees).
•
Short sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on shares of our Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock.
•
The perceived values of Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock relative to one another.
A substantial amount of our shares is owned by a small contingent of stockholders.
Willow Grove Holdings LP, directly and through controlled entities (“WGHLP”), owns 9,767,011 shares of Voting Common stock, and together with Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen, owns 9,803,642 shares (approximately 50.0%) of Voting Common Stock.
The general partner of WGHLP controls the voting and disposition decisions with respect to the Voting Common Stock owned by WGHLP, and is managed by Edward J. Shoen (the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of U-Haul Holding Company) and his brother, Mark V. Shoen.
Accordingly,
Edward J. Shoen
and
Mark V. Shoen
are in a position to significantly influence
our business and policies, including the approval of
certain
significant transactions, the election of the members of
our
Board and other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that their
interests will not conflict with the interests
of our other stockholders.
In addition, 855,032 shares (approximately 4.4%) of Voting Common Stock are owned under our ESOP.
Each ESOP participant is entitled to vote the shares allocated to himself or herself in their discretion.
In the event an ESOP participant does not vote his or her shares, such shares shall be voted by the ESOP trustee, in the ESOP trustee’s discretion.
The concentrated voting control of U-Haul Holding Company may limit or severely restrict our stockholders’   ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. Further, this concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could cause the trading price of our capital stock to decline or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their capital stock. As a result, the market price of our Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock could be adversely affected

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Stock Dividend
The description of the issuance of shares of Non-Voting Common Stock by way of a stock dividend to our shareholders is incorporated herein by reference to Items 3.02 and 8.01 of our
Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 24, 2022.
