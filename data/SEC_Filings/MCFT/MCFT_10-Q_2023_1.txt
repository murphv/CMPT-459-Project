CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of statements that include words such as “could,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “expect,” “likely,” “believe,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project” and other similar words or phrases. Forward-looking statements involve estimates and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.
The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on assumptions that we have made considering our industry experience and our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other important factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read and consider this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control) and assumptions. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many important factors could affect our actual operating and financial performance and cause our performance to differ materially from the performance anticipated in the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the following: changes in interest rates, the potential effects of supply chain disruptions and production inefficiencies, general economic conditions, demand for our products, inflation, changes in consumer preferences, competition within our industry, our reliance on our network of independent dealers, our ability to manage our manufacturing levels and our fixed cost base, the successful introduction of our new products, geopolitical conflicts and the other important factors described under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on September 9, 2022 (our “2022 Annual Report”) and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Quarterly Report"). Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of these assumptions prove incorrect, our actual operating and financial performance may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements.
Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New important factors that could cause our business not to develop as we expect may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation
— The Company’s fiscal year begins July 1 and ends June 30, with the interim quarterly reporting periods consisting of 13 weeks. Therefore, the fiscal quarter end will not always coincide with the date of the end of a calendar month.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings") and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Holdings and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to herein as the "Company."
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2022, and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments considered necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of January 1, 2023, its results of operations for the three and six months ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, its cash flows for the six months ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, and its statements of stockholders’ equity for the three and six months ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022. All adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC for financial information have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The June 30, 2022 condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from the audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. However, management believes that the disclosures in these condensed consolidated financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Due to the seasonality of the Company’s business, the interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the remainder of the fiscal year.
There were no significant changes in or changes to the application of the Company’s significant or critical accounting policies or estimation procedures for the three and six months ended January 1, 2023, as compared with those described in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 . Investments
— The Company has, and may continue to invest excess cash balances in short-term debt securities, such as money market funds, government-sponsored securities, corporate bonds, and/or certificates of deposit. The Company accounts for its investments in debt securities in accordance with ASC 320,
Investments — Debt and Equity Securities . This statement requires debt securities to be classified into three categories: Held-to-maturity — Debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are measured at amortized cost and are presented at the net amount expected to be collected. Any change in the allowance for credit losses during the period is reflected in earnings. Discounts and premiums to par value of the debt securities are amortized to interest income/expense over the term of the security. Trading Securities — Debt securities that are bought and held primarily for the purpose of selling in the near term are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Available-for-Sale — Debt securities not classified as either securities held-to-maturity or trading securities are reported at fair value. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we evaluate as of the balance sheet date whether the unrealized losses are attributable to a credit loss or other factors. The portion of unrealized losses related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings, and the portion of unrealized loss not related to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. We classify our investments in debt securities based on the facts and circumstances present at the time of purchase of the securities. We subsequently reassess the appropriateness of that classification at each reporting date. During the quarter ended January 1, 2023, all of our investments in debt securities were classified as held-to-maturity and are due to mature within one year (see Note 4). Estimated fair value measurements related to our debt securities are Level 2 measurements. See Part IV. Item 15, Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies, Fair Value Measurements in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further fair value measurement details.

Discontinued Operations
— On September 2, 2022, the Company sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its NauticStar segment. The disposal represented the Company's exit from the saltwater fishing and deck boat category, a strategic shift that has a significant effect on the Company's operations and financial results, and as such, qualifies for reporting as discontinued operations. The NauticStar segment results, for the periods presented, are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows as discontinued operations. Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations are classified as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated balance sheet for the prior-period presented (see Note 3).
Unless otherwise indicated, the financial disclosures and related information provided herein relate to our continuing operations and we have recast prior period amounts to reflect discontinued operations. Reclassifications
— Certain historical amounts have been reclassified in these condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes herewith to conform to the current presentation.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On September 2, 2022, the Company sold its NauticStar business to certain affiliates of Iconic Marine Group, LLC ("Purchaser"). Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, substantially all of the assets of NauticStar were sold, including, among other things, all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in its wholly-owned subsidiary NS Transport, LLC, all owned real property, equipment, inventory, intellectual property and accounts receivable, and the Purchaser assumed substantially all of the liabilities of NauticStar, including, among other things, product liability and warranty claims. In conjunction with the purchase agreement, the Company entered into a joint employer services agreement and a transition services agreement, which provide certain services to the Purchaser for various periods of time after the sale. Both agreements ended during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. These agreements did not a have a material impact on expenditures, earnings, nor cash flows during the three and six months ended January 1, 2023. Further, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement as described further in Note 9 related to waivers of restrictions within the Credit Agreement, as amended, on the sale of assets.
During the three and six months ended January 1, 2023 , the Company recognized a $ 0.4
million and $ 22.5
million loss on sale, respectively, subject to further changes based upon a customary working capital adjustment. Furthermore, assets and liabilities retained, primarily related to certain claims, are subject to change, with activity after the date of sale being recorded as discontinued operations.

4. INVESTMENTS   During the quarter ended January 1, 2023, we invested a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in short-term investments, which primarily consist of investment grade corporate bonds. We have the ability and intention to hold these investments until maturity and therefore have classified these investments as held-to-maturity and recorded them at amortized cost and presented them in “Held-to-maturity securities” on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2023. As of June 30, 2022, there were no outstanding held-to-maturity investments.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   Legal Proceedings   The Company is subject to various litigation, claims and proceedings, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues for litigation, claims and proceedings when a liability is both probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
As of January 1, 2023 , the Company’s accruals for litigation matters are not material. While these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, management believes that current litigation, claims and proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, and after considering expected insurance reimbursements, are not likely to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On June 28, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides the Company with a $ 160.0
million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $ 60.0
million term loan (the “Term Loan”) and a $ 100.0
million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Credit Agreement refinanced and replaced the previously existing credit agreement. The Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company’s assets.
The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability to, subject to specified exceptions, incur additional debt; incur additional liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; pay dividends or make other distributions; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. The Company is also required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio.
On August 31, 2022, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement to obtain the necessary consents and waivers related to the sale of the NauticStar segment on September 2, 2022, as discussed in Note 3. 13
The Credit Agreement, as amended, bears interest, at the Company’s option, at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from
0.25 % to
1.00 % or at an adjusted term benchmark rate plus an applicable margin ranging from
1.25 % to
2.00 %, in each case based on the Company’s net leverage ratio. The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee for any unused portion of the revolving credit facility ranging from
0.15 % to
0.30 % based on the Company’s net leverage ratio. Effective during the
three and six months ended January 1, 2023 , the applicable margin for loans accruing at the prime rate was
0.25 % and the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at the benchmark rate was
1.25 %. As of
January 1, 2023 , the interest rate on the Company’s term loan was
5.67 %. The Credit Agreement will mature and all remaining amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on June 28, 2026. As of January 1, 2023, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. Revolving Credit Facility As of January 1, 2023 , the Company had
no
amounts outstanding on its Revolving Credit Facility and had remaining availability of
$ 100.0
million .
10. INCOME TAXES The Company’s consolidated interim effective tax rate is based on a current estimate of the annual effective income tax rate adjusted to reflect the impact of discrete items. The differences between the Company’s effective tax rates and the statutory federal tax rate of
21.0 % primarily relate to the inclusion of the state tax rate in the overall effective rate, the benefit of federal and state credits, and a permanent benefit associated with the foreign derived intangible income deduction, partially offset by a permanent add-back for Section 162(m) limitations. During the three months ended
January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the Company's effective tax rate was
24.4 %
and
23.2 % , respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended January 1, 2023 is higher compared to the effective tax rate for the three months ended January 2, 2022, primarily due to an increase in the tax impact of uncertain state tax positions and an increase in the effective state tax rate. During the six months ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the Company’s effective tax rate was
23.4 % .

Restricted Stock Awards During the six months ended January 1, 2023 , the Company granted
97,525
restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) to the Company’s non-executive directors, officers and certain other key employees. Generally, the shares of restricted stock granted during the
six months ended January 1, 2023 , vest pro-rata over
three years
for officers and certain other key employees and over
one year
for non-executive directors. The Company determined the fair value of the shares awarded by using the close price of our common stock as of the date of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value of RSAs granted in the
six months ended January 1, 2023 , was $ 23.55
per share.

As of January 1, 2023 , there was $ 2.8
million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested RSAs. The Company expects this expense to be recognized over a weighted average period of
1.8
years. Performance Stock Units Performance stock units (“PSUs”) are a form of long-term incentive compensation awarded to executive officers and certain other key employees designed to directly align the interests of employees to the interests of the Company’s stockholders, and to create long-term stockholder value. The awards will be earned based on the Company’s achievement of certain performance criteria over a
three-year
performance period. The performance period for the awards commences on July 1 of the fiscal year in which they were granted and continue for a three-year period, ending on June 30 of the applicable year. The probability of achieving the performance criteria is assessed quarterly. Following the determination of the Company’s achievement with respect to the performance criteria, the number of shares awarded is subject to further adjustment based on the application of a total shareholder return (“TSR”) modifier. The grant date fair value is determined based on both the probability assessment of the Company achieving the performance criteria and an estimate of the expected TSR modifier. The TSR modifier estimate is determined using a Monte Carlo Simulation model, which considers the likelihood of numerous possible outcomes of long-term market performance. Compensation expense related to nonvested PSUs is recognized ratably over the performance period. The following table summarizes the status of nonvested PSUs as of
January 1, 2023, and changes during the six months then ended.

For the three and six months ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, an immaterial number of shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. Stock Repurchase Program On June 24, 2021, the board of directors of the Company authorized a stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to $ 50.0
million of the Company’s common stock during the three-year period ending June 24, 2024. During the three months ended
January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 , the Company repurchased
224,284
shares and
356,296
shares of common stock for $ 4.8
million and $ 9.9
million, respectively, in cash, including related fees and expenses. During the
six months ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 , the Company repurchased
415,644
shares and
414,675
shares of common stock for $ 9.0
million and $ 11.4
million, respectively, in cash, including related fees and expenses. As of
January 1, 2023 , $ 15.6
million remained available under the program.
13. SEGMENT INFORMATION Reportable Segments Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the CODM in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. For the three and six months ended January 1, 2023 , the Company’s CODM regularly assessed the operating performance of the Company’s boat brands under
three
operating and reportable segments:
• The MasterCraft segment produces boats at its Vonore, Tennessee facility. These are premium recreational performance sport boats primarily used for water skiing, wakeboarding, wake surfing, and general recreational boating. • The Crest segment produces pontoon boats at its Owosso, Michigan facility. Crest’s boats are primarily used for general recreational boating.
• The Aviara segment produces luxury day boats at its Merritt Island, Florida facility. Aviara boats are primarily used for general recreational boating. 16
Each segment distributes its products through its own independent dealer network. Each segment also has its own management structure which is responsible for the operations of the segment and is directly accountable to the CODM for the operating performance of the segment, which is regularly assessed by the CODM who allocates resources based on that performance. The Company files a consolidated income tax return and does not allocate income taxes and other corporate-level expenses, including interest, to operating segments. All material corporate costs are included in the MasterCraft segment. Selected financial information for the Company’s reportable segments was as follows:

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, the statements in this discussion and analysis regarding our expectations concerning the performance of our business, anticipated financial results, liquidity and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above and in “Risk Factors” set forth in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this Quarterly Report. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.
Certain statements in the following discussions are based on non-GAAP financial measures. A “non-GAAP financial measure” is a numerical measure of a registrant’s historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and statistical measures. The Company includes non-GAAP financial measures in Management’s Discussion and Analysis, as the Company’s management believes that these measures and the information they provide are useful to users of the financial statements, including investors, because they permit users of the financial statements to view the Company’s performance using the same tools that management utilizes and to better evaluate the Company’s ongoing business performance. In order to better align the Company’s reported results with the internal metrics used by the Company's management to evaluate business performance as well as to provide better comparisons to prior periods and peer data, non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of purchase accounting amortization related to business acquisitions.
Discontinued Operations
On September 2, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its NauticStar business. This business, which was previously reported as the Company's NauticStar segment until fiscal 2023, is being reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Company's results for all periods presented, as discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis, are presented on a continuing operations basis with prior year amounts recast to provide visibility and comparability. See Note 3 in Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on Discontinued Operations.
Overview
All segments contributed to the strong performance and increased net sales and profitability despite ongoing supply chain disruptions and macroeconomic uncertainty. Net sales increased $14.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to the prior-year period. Gross margin decreased 120 basis points due to higher costs from inflationary pressures, changes in model mix, higher dealer incentives, and increased warranty costs, partially offset by higher prices and improved production efficiencies.
Outlook
Our sales are impacted by general economic conditions, which affect the demand for our products, optional features, availability and cost of credit for our dealers and retail consumers, and overall consumer confidence. While the marine industry benefited from changes in consumer preferences accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, macroeconomic headwinds may adversely impact our financial results in fiscal 2023. However, as retail trends evolve, we believe our highly flexible business model will allow us to mitigate the impact of these downward pressures for fiscal 2023.
We will continue to actively monitor the impact of general economic conditions, supply chain disruptions, macroeconomic uncertainty, inflation, and other evolving factors on our business. However, the full extent of the impact on our business, operations, and financial results cannot be predicted. See Item 1A. "Risk Factors" set forth in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and this Quarterly Report.

Net sales increased 10.2 percent during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, when compared with the same prior-year period. Net sales benefited from higher prices, partially offset by decreased sales volumes and increased dealer incentives. Dealer incentives include higher floor plan financing costs and other incentives as dealer inventories recover.
Net sales increased 19.5 percent during the first six months of fiscal 2023, when compared with the same prior-year period. Net sales benefited from higher prices, increased options and content sales, and favorable model mix, partially offset by increased dealer incentives.

Gross margin decreased 120 basis points during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, when compared with the same prior-year period, due to higher costs from inflationary pressures, changes in mix, higher dealer incentives, and increased warranty costs, partially offset by higher prices and improved production efficiencies.
Gross margin increased 130 basis points during the first six months of fiscal 2023, when compared with the same prior-year period, due to higher net sales and improved production efficiencies, partially offset by higher costs from inflationary pressures, higher dealer incentives and increased warranty costs.
Operating expenses decreased $1.0 million and $1.4 million during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively, when compared to the same prior year periods, primarily related to decreased variable compensation costs. Additionally, an impairment charge of $1.1 million related to the allocated goodwill associated with the Aviara segment was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as discussed in Note 6 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Interest income of $0.6 million and $0.8 million during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively, is derived primarily from investments in a portfolio of fixed income securities as part of the Company's cash management strategy.

Non-GAAP Measures
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
We define EBITDA as net income from continuing operations, before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations. For the periods presented herein, these adjustments include share-based compensation and goodwill impairment. We define EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin as EBIDTA and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, each expressed as a percentage of Net sales.
21
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share
We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share as net income from continuing operations, adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and reflecting income tax expense on adjusted net income before income taxes at our estimated annual effective tax rate. For the periods presented herein, these adjustments include other intangible asset amortization, share-based compensation, and goodwill impairment.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per share, which we refer to collectively as the Non-GAAP Measures, are not measures of net income or operating income as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The Non-GAAP Measures are not measures of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income per share, or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow. We believe that the inclusion of the Non-GAAP Measures is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts and investors use the Non-GAAP Measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than does U.S. GAAP measures alone.
We believe Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share assists our board of directors, management, investors, and other users of the financial statements in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes certain non-cash items and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and reflecting income tax expense on adjusted net income before income taxes at our estimated annual effective tax rate. The Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
• Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and the Non-GAAP measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;
• The Non-GAAP measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
• The Non-GAAP measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
• The Non-GAAP measures do not reflect our tax expense or any cash requirements to pay income taxes;
• The Non-GAAP measures do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness; and
• The Non-GAAP measures do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations, but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations.
In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry.
Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, due to the effects of discontinued operations, as discussed above, the Company's non-GAAP financial measures are presented on a continuing operations basis, for all periods presented.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance working capital, fund capital expenditures, service our debt, fund our stock repurchase program, and fund potential business acquisitions. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash balance, investments due to their short-term nature, cash generated from operating activities, our revolving credit agreement and the refinancing and/or new issuance of long-term debt. We believe our cash balance, investments, cash from operations, and our ability to borrow will be sufficient to provide for our liquidity and capital resource needs.
Cash and cash equivalents totaled $29.1 million as of January 1, 2023, a decrease of $5.1 million from $34.2 million as of June 30, 2022. Held-to-maturity securities totaled $59.7 million as of January 1, 2023. As of June 30, 2022, there were no outstanding held-to-maturity securities. Total debt as of January 1, 2023 and June 30, 2022, was $55.1 million and $56.5 million, respectively.
As of January 1, 2023, we had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving $100.0 million of available borrowing capacity. Refer to Note 9 — Long Term Debt in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
On June 24, 2021, the board of directors of the Company authorized a stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our common stock during the three-year period ending June 24, 2024. During the six months ended January 1, 2023, the Company repurchased 415,644 shares of common stock for $9.0 million in cash, including related fees and expenses.

Six Months Ended January 1, 2023 Cash Flows from Continuing Operations
Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended January 1, 2023 was $79.8 million, primarily due to net income and cash provided by favorable changes in working capital. Working capital is defined as accounts receivable, income tax receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses and other current assets net of accounts payable, income tax payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities as presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, excluding the impact of acquisitions and non-cash adjustments. Favorable changes in working capital primarily consisted of a decrease in accounts receivable and inventories, and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Partially offsetting favorable changes in working capital was a decrease in accounts payable and income tax payable. Accounts receivable decreased primarily as a result of lower sales at the end of the period compared to the end of the prior-year period. Inventories decreased as we rebalance inventory levels after the summer selling season, partially offset by increased materials costs from inflation. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily increased due to increased warranty and floor plan interest costs, offset by payments of other dealer incentives. Accounts payable decreased as a result of decreased production levels during the holiday season. Income tax payable decreased due to the tax benefit generated from the sale of NauticStar.
Net cash used in investing activities was $71.6 million, due to investments in held-to-maturity securities of $59.7 million and $11.9 million of capital expenditures. Our capital spending was focused on expanding our capacity, maintenance capital, and information technology.
Net cash used in financing activities was $10.9 million, which included net payments of $1.5 million on long-term debt and stock repurchases totaling $9.0 million.
Six Months Ended January 2, 2022 Cash Flows from Continuing Operations
Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended January 2, 2022 totaled $26.7 million mainly due to net income, partially offset by working capital usage. Working capital usage primarily consisted of an increase in inventory and a decrease in accounts payable. Partially offsetting the working capital usage was a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Inventory increased $17.0 million for the first half of fiscal 2022 due to an increase in raw materials to support higher production volumes and to increase safety stock to manage supply chain risk. Work in process increased due to supply chain disruptions. Accounts payable decreased as a result of the timing of purchases and payment of invoices. Accounts receivable decreased due to decreased sales at the end of the period compared to the end of the prior-year period. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased due to increased contract liabilities and increased warranty costs, partially offset due to continuing strong retail demand without the need for rebates, as well as payments of variable compensation that were accrued for at June 30, 2021.
Net cash used in investing activities was $4.9 million, which consisted of capital expenditures. Our capital spending was focused on expanding our capacity and maintenance capital.
Net cash used in financing activities was $31.1 million and related to net payments of long-term debt of $19.5 million and funding of the stock repurchase program totaling $11.4 million.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements as of January 1, 2023.
Critical Accounting Policies
As of January 1, 2023, there were no significant changes in or changes to the application of our critical accounting policies or estimation procedures from those presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on September 9, 2022.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
We maintain an investment portfolio comprised of fixed income securities, all designated as held-to-maturity securities. Fixed income securities do carry some degree of interest rate and credit risk. However, due to the securities' investment grade ratings, short-term nature, and our intention to hold the securities to maturity, we do not expect to recognize impairment losses on declines in fair value
25
below our cost basis. See Note 4 in Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on investments.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) (of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of January 1, 2023.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 1, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

RISK
FACTORS.
Except as noted below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
We face risks associated with our investments.
We maintain an investment portfolio comprised of fixed income securities, all designated as held-to-maturity securities. While all of these securities currently maintain an investment grade rating and will mature within one year, these securities are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of issuer credit quality, increases in delinquency and default rates, changes in prevailing interest rates and other economic factors. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that our current or future investments will not result in losses or impairments, which would negatively impact our earnings and financial condition.
