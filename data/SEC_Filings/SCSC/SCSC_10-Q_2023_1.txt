Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Business Description ScanSource, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries referred to as “the Company” or “ScanSource”) is a leading hybrid distributor connecting devices to the cloud and accelerating growth for partners across hardware, Software as a Service ("SaaS"), connectivity and cloud. The Company brings technology solutions and services from the world’s leading suppliers of mobility and barcode, point-of-sale ("POS"), payments, physical security, unified communications and collaboration, telecom and cloud services to market. The Company operates in the United States, Canada, Brazil and the UK. The Company's
two
operating segments, Specialty Technology Solutions and Modern Communications & Cloud, are based on technology. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared by the Company’s management in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring and non-recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the results of operations for the quarters and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the statements of comprehensive income for the quarters and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the statements of shareholders' equity for the quarters and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the statements of cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The results of operations for the quarters and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Unless otherwise indicated, disclosures provided in the Notes pertain to continuing operations only. The Company has reclassified certain prior-year amounts in the segment results to conform with current year presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on the condensed consolidated financial results. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies There have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from the policies described in the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. For a discussion of the Company’s significant accounting policies, please see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains zero-balance disbursement accounts at various financial institutions at which the Company does not maintain significant depository relationships. Due to the terms of the agreements governing these accounts, the Company generally does not have the right to offset outstanding checks written from these accounts against cash on hand, and the respective institutions are not legally obligated to honor the checks until sufficient funds are transferred to fund the checks.
As a result, checks released but not yet cleared from these accounts in the amounts of $ 8.9
million and $ 18.0
million are included in accounts payable on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Long-lived Assets 11 Table of Contents The Company presents depreciation expense and intangible amortization expense on the Condensed Consolidated Income Statements. The Company's depreciation expense related to selling, general and administrative costs totaled $ 2.7
million and $ 5.4
million for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022 and $ 2.5
million and $ 5.4
million for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2021. Depreciation expense reported as part of cost of goods sold on the Condensed Consolidated Income Statements totaled $ 0.2
million and $ 0.5
million for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company's intangible amortization expense reported on the Condensed Consolidated Income Statements relates to selling, general and administrative costs, not the cost of selling goods.
Intangible amortization expense totaled $ 4.2
million and $ 8.4
million for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022 and $ 4.4
million and $ 9.0
million for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2021. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company has reviewed newly issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they are either not applicable to its business or that no material effect is expected on its consolidated financial statements as a result of future adoption. (2)
Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable, Net The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated future expected credit losses resulting from customers’ failure to make payments on accounts receivable due to the Company. The Company has notes receivable with certain customers, which are included in “Accounts receivable, less allowance” in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management determines the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable by considering a number of factors, including: (i) historical experience, (ii) aging of the accounts receivable, (iii) specific information obtained by the Company on the financial condition and the current creditworthiness of its customers, (iv) the current economic and country-specific environment and (v) reasonable and supportable forecasts about collectability. Expected credit losses are estimated on a pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist using an age-based reserve model. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Estimates of expected credit losses on trade receivables over the contractual life are recorded at inception and adjusted over the contractual life. The changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are set forth in the table below.
June 30, 2022 Amounts Charged to Expense Write-offs Other  (1) December 31, 2022 (in thousands) Trade accounts and current notes receivable allowance $ 16,806   $ 33   $ ( 2,842 ) $ ( 644 ) $ 13,353   (1) "Other" amounts include recoveries and the effect of foreign currency fluctuations for the six months ended December 31, 2022.

Revenue Recognition The Company provides technology solutions and services from the world's leading suppliers of mobility, barcode, POS, payments, physical security, unified communications, collaboration, telecom and cloud services. This includes hardware, related accessories and device configuration as well as software licenses, professional services and hardware support programs.
In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize, the Company applies the following five-step model: (i) identify contracts with customers; (ii) identify performance obligations in the contracts; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations per the contracts; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue as control of products and services are transferred to customers, which is generally at the point of shipment. The Company delivers products to customers in several ways, including: (i) shipment from a Company warehouse, (ii) drop-shipment directly from the supplier or (iii) electronic delivery for non-physical products.
Principal versus Agent Considerations 12 Table of Contents The Company is the principal for sales of all hardware and certain software and services. The Company considers itself the principal in those transactions where it has control of the product or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company recognizes the principal-associated revenue and cost of goods sold on a gross basis. The Company is the agent for third-party service contracts, including product warranties and supplier-hosted software. These service contracts are sold separately from the products, and the Company often serves as the agent for the contract on behalf of the original equipment manufacturer. The Company's responsibility is to arrange for the provision of the specified service by the original equipment manufacturer, and the Company does not control the specified service before it is transferred to the customer. Because the Company acts as an agent, revenue is recognized net of cost at the time of sale. The Intelisys business operates under an agency model.
Variable Considerations For certain transactions, products are sold with a right of return and may also provide other rebates or incentives, which are accounted for as variable consideration. The Company estimates a returns allowance based on historical experience and reduces revenue accordingly. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration for rebates and incentives by using the expected value to be given to the customer and reduces the revenue by those estimated amounts. These estimates are reviewed and updated as necessary at the end of each reporting period. Contract Balances The Company records contract assets and liabilities for payments received from customers in advance of services performed. These assets and liabilities are the result of the sales of the Company's self-branded warranty programs and other transactions where control has not yet passed to the customer. These amounts are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.

Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt The following table presents the Company’s debt at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. 15 Table of Contents December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 (in thousands) Current portion of long-term debt $ 5,040   $ 11,598   Mississippi revenue bond, net of current portion 3,381   3,733   Senior secured term loan facility, net of current portion 144,375   120,000   Borrowings under revolving credit facility 230,000   135,839   Total debt $ 382,796   $ 271,170   Credit Facility The Company has a multi-currency senior secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of banks (as amended, the “Amended Credit Agreement”). On September 28, 2022, ScanSource, Inc. amended and restated the Amended Credit Agreement, which includes (i) a
five-year , $ 350  million multicurrency senior secured revolving credit facility and (ii) a
five-year
$ 150  million senior secured term loan facility. The Amended Credit Agreement extended the credit facility maturity date to September 28, 2027. In addition, pursuant to an “accordion feature,” the Company may increase its borrowings up to an additional $ 250
million, subject to obtaining additional credit commitments from the lenders participating in the increase. The Amended Credit Agreement allows for the issuance of up to $ 50
million for letters of credit. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of the domestic assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries. Under the terms of the revolving credit facility, the payment of cash dividends is restricted. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of $ 1.4
million in connection with the amendment and restatement of the Amended Credit Agreement. These costs were capitalized to other non-current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and added to the unamortized debt issuance costs from the previous credit facility. Loans denominated in U.S. dollars, other than swingline loans, shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, (i) the adjusted Term SOFR or adjusted daily simple SOFR plus an additional margin ranging from
1.00 % to
1.75 %, depending upon the Company’s ratio of (A) total consolidated debt less up to $ 30  million of unrestricted domestic cash to (B) trailing four-quarter consolidated EBITDA measured as of the end of the most recent year or quarter, as applicable, for which financial statements have been delivered to the Lenders (the “leverage ratio”); or (ii) the alternate base rate plus an additional margin ranging from
0 % to
0.75 %, depending upon the Company’s leverage ratio, plus, if applicable, certain mandatory costs. All swingline loans denominated in U.S. dollars shall bear interest based upon the adjusted daily simple SOFR, floating daily, plus an additional margin ranging from
1.00 % to
1.75 %, depending upon the Company's leverage ratio, or such other rate as the Company and the applicable swingline lender may agree. The adjusted term SOFR and adjusted daily simple SOFR include a fixed credit adjustment of
0.10 % over the applicable SOFR reference rate. Loans denominated in foreign currencies shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable benchmark rate set forth in the New Credit Agreement plus an additional margin ranging from
1.00 % to
1.75 %, depending upon the Company’s leverage ratio, plus, if applicable, certain mandatory costs.
During the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company's borrowings under the credit facility were U.S. dollar loans. The spread in effect as of December 31, 2022 was
1.50 %, plus a
0.10 % credit spread adjustment for SOFR-based loans and
0.50 % for alternate base rate loans. The commitment fee rate in effect at December 31, 2022 was
0.25 %. The Amended Credit Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants. Specifically, the Company’s Leverage Ratio must be less than or equal to
3.50
to 1.00 at all times. In addition, the Company’s Interest Coverage Ratio (as such term is defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) must be at least
3.00
to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter. In the event of a default, customary remedies are available to the lenders, including acceleration and increased interest rates. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility at December 31, 2022.
The average daily outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility, excluding the term loan facility, during the six month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 219.5
million and $ 57.1
million, respectively. There was $ 120.0
million and $ 214.2
million available for additional borrowings as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. There were
no
letters of credit issued under the multi-currency revolving credit facility at December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022. Mississippi Revenue Bond 16 Table of Contents On August 1, 2007, the Company entered into an agreement with the State of Mississippi to provide financing for the acquisition and installation of certain equipment to be utilized at the Company’s Southaven, Mississippi warehouse, through the issuance of an industrial development revenue bond. The bond matures on September 1, 2032 and accrues interest at the 30-day LIBOR rate plus a spread of
0.85 %. The terms of the bond allow for payment of interest only for the first
10
years of the agreement, and then, starting on September 1, 2018 through 2032, principal and interest payments are due until the maturity date or the redemption of the bond. The agreement also provides the bondholder with a put option, exercisable only within
180
days of each fifth anniversary of the agreement, requiring the Company to pay back the bonds at
100 % of the principal amount outstanding. At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under this bond. The interest rates at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 were
4.97 % and
1.97 %, respectively. Debt Issuance Costs At December 31, 2022, net debt issuance costs associated with the credit facility and bond totaled $ 1.8
million and are being amortized on a straight-line basis through the maturity date of each respective debt instrument. (8)
Derivatives and Hedging Activities The Company's results of operations could be materially impacted by significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In an effort to manage the exposure to these risks, the Company periodically enters into various derivative instruments. The Company's accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company records all derivatives on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments or the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in other income and expense. Foreign Currency Derivatives
– The Company conducts a portion of its business internationally in a variety of foreign currencies and is exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company attempts to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and once these opportunities have been exhausted the Company uses currency options and forward contracts or other hedging instruments with third parties. These contracts will periodically hedge the exchange of various currencies, including the U.S. dollar, Brazilian real, euro, British pound and Canadian dollar.
The Company had contracts outstanding for purposes of managing cash flows with notional amounts of $ 47.4
million and $ 34.5
million for the exchange of foreign currencies at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. To date, the Company has chosen not to designate these derivatives as hedging instruments, and accordingly, these instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in other income and expense.
Summarized financial information related to these derivative contracts and changes in the underlying value of the foreign currency exposures included in the Condensed Consolidated Income Statements for the quarters and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:   Quarter ended Six months ended December 31, December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021   (in thousands) Net foreign exchange derivative contract losses (gains) $ 871   $ ( 523 ) $ 1,309   $ ( 2,175 ) Net foreign currency transactional and re-measurement (gains) losses ( 524 ) 1,003   ( 39 ) 3,141   Net foreign currency exchange losses $ 347   $ 480   $ 1,270   $ 966   Net foreign currency exchange gains and losses consist of foreign currency transactional and functional currency re-measurements, offset by net foreign currency exchange contract gains and losses and are included in other income and expense.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are generated as the result of fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Brazilian real, the U.S. dollar versus the euro, the British pound versus the euro, and the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar.. Interest Rates -
The Company’s earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from floating rate debt instruments. The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by using interest rate swaps to hedge this exposure and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating rate debt. On April 30, 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which was amended on September 28, 2022 to change the reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR. The swap agreement has a notional amount of $ 100.0
million, with a $ 50.0
million tranche scheduled to mature on April 30, 2024 and a $ 50.0
million tranche scheduled to mature April 30, 2026.
This swap
17 Table of Contents agreement is designated as a cash flow hedge to hedge the variable rate interest payments on the revolving credit facility. Interest rate differentials paid or received under the swap agreement are recognized as adjustments to interest expense. To the extent the swap is effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows, changes in the fair value of the swap are not included in current earnings but are reported as other comprehensive income (loss). There was no ineffective portion to be recorded as an adjustment to earnings for the quarters and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The components of the cash flow hedge included in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the quarters and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, are as follows: Quarter ended Six months ended December 31, December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 (in thousands) Net interest (income) expense recognized as a result of interest rate swap $ ( 345 ) $ 579   $ ( 313 ) $ 1,157   Unrealized gain in fair value of interest rate swap 349   999   2,849   983   Net increase in accumulated other comprehensive income 4   1,578   2,536   2,140   Income tax effect 1   406   652   555   Net increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax $ 3   $ 1,172   $ 1,884   $ 1,585   The Company used the following derivative instruments at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, reflected in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, for the risk management purposes detailed above:   December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022   Balance Sheet Location Fair Value  of Derivatives Designated  as Hedge Instruments Fair Value  of Derivatives Not Designated as  Hedge Instruments Fair Value  of Derivatives Designated

Fair Value of Financial Instruments Accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Under this guidance, the Company classifies certain assets and liabilities based on the fair value hierarchy, which aggregates fair value measured assets and liabilities based upon the following levels of inputs: • Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; • Level 2 – Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and • Level 3 – Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). The assets and liabilities maintained by the Company that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis include deferred compensation plan investments, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency hedge agreements and interest rate swap agreements. The carrying value of debt is considered to approximate fair value, as the Company’s debt instruments are indexed to a variable rate using the market approach (Level 2).
The following table summarizes the valuation of the Company’s remaining assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022: Total Quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2)   (in thousands) Assets: Deferred compensation plan investments, current and non-current portion $ 27,387   $ 27,387   $ —   Interest rate swap agreement 4,223   —   4,223   Total assets at fair value $ 31,610   $ 27,387   $ 4,223   Liabilities: Deferred compensation plan investments, current and non-current portion $ 27,387   $ 27,387   $ —   Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 9   —   9   Foreign currency hedge 281   —   281   Total liabilities at fair value $ 27,677   $ 27,387   $ 290   The following table summarizes the valuation of the Company’s remaining assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2022: 19 Table of Contents Total Quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2)   (in thousands) Assets: Deferred compensation plan investments, current and non-current portion $ 25,178   $ 25,178   $ —   Interest rate swap agreement 1,686   —   1,686   Total assets at fair value $ 26,864   $ 25,178   $ 1,686   Liabilities: Deferred compensation plan investments, current and non-current portion $ 25,178   $ 25,178   $ —   Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 5   —   5   Foreign currency hedge 93   —   93   Total liabilities at fair value $ 25,276   $ 25,178   $ 98   The investments in the deferred compensation plan are held in a "rabbi trust" and include mutual funds and cash equivalents for payment of non-qualified benefits for certain retired, terminated and active employees. These investments are recorded to prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current assets depending on their corresponding, anticipated distribution dates to recipients, which are reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities, respectively. Derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts, are measured using the market approach on a recurring basis considering foreign currency spot rates and forward rates quoted by banks or foreign currency dealers and interest rates quoted by banks (Level 2).
Fair values of interest rate swaps are measured using standard valuation models with inputs that can be derived from observable market transactions, including LIBOR spot and forward rates (Level 2). Foreign currency contracts and interest rate swap agreements are classified in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as prepaid expenses and other non-current assets or accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, depending on the respective instruments' favorable or unfavorable positions.

Leases
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 842, at contract inception the Company determines if a contract contains a lease by assessing whether the contract contains an identified asset and whether the Company has the ability to control the asset. The Company also determines if the lease meets the classification criteria for an operating lease versus a finance lease under ASC 842. Substantially all of the Company's leases are operating leases for real estate, warehouse and office equipment ranging in duration from
1
year to
10
years. The Company has elected not to record short-term operating
21 Table of Contents leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating leases are recorded as other non-current assets, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has finance leases for information technology equipment expiring through fiscal year 2027. Finance leases are recorded as
property and equipment, net ,
accrued expenses and other current liabilities
and
other long-term liabilities
on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The gross amount of the balances recorded related to finance leases is immaterial to the condensed consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2022 and the consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2022. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the net present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company generally is not able to determine the rate implicit in its leases and has elected to apply an incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the present value determination, which is based on the Company's cost of borrowings for the relevant terms of each lease and geographical economic factors. Certain operating lease agreements contain options to extend or terminate the lease. The lease term used is adjusted for these options when the Company is reasonably certain it will exercise the option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments not based on a rate or index, such as costs for common area maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Further, the Company has elected the practical expedient to recognize all lease and non-lease components as a single lease component, where applicable.

Commitments and Contingencies The Company and its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to lawsuits arising out of operations. Although there can be no assurance, based upon information known to the Company, the Company believes that any liability resulting from an adverse determination of such lawsuits would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. During the Company's due diligence for the Network1 acquisition, several pre-acquisition contingencies were identified regarding various Brazilian federal and state tax exposures. The Company recorded indemnification receivables that are reported gross of the pre-acquisition contingency liabilities as the funds were escrowed as part of the acquisition. The amount available after the impact of foreign currency translation for future pre-acquisition contingency settlements or to be released to the sellers was
$ 3.0
million and $ 4.1
million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The table below summarizes the balances and line item presentation of Network1's pre-acquisition contingencies and corresponding indemnification receivables in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022: December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Network1   (in thousands) Assets Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 15   $ 15   Other non-current assets $ 3,833   $ 3,818   Liabilities Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 15   $ 15   Other long-term liabilities $ 3,833   $ 3,818   (13)

During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, there were
no
material discrete items. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, a discrete net tax benefit of $ 0.7  million was recorded, which is primarily attributable to a notional interest deduction on the net equity of the Company's Brazilian subsidiary. 23 Table of Contents The Company’s effective tax rate of
28.9 % and
27.3 % for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022, differs from the current federal statutory rate of 21% primarily as a result of income derived from tax jurisdictions with varying income tax rates, nondeductible expenses and state income taxes. The Company's effective tax rate was
23.9 % and
24.4 % for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the Company is not permanently reinvested with respect to all earnings generated by foreign operations. The Company has determined that there is no material deferred tax liability for federal, state and withholding tax related to undistributed earnings. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, foreign subsidiaries repatriated cash of $ 9.1  million to the United States. There is no certainty to the timing of any future distributions of such earnings to the U.S. in whole or in part. The Company had approximately $ 1.1  million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. Of this total at December 31, 2022, approximately $ 0.9  million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that are permanent in nature and, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate. The Company does not believe that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months of the reporting date. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had approximately $ 1.2  million accrued for interest and penalties. The Company conducts business globally and one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal, various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities in countries and states in which it operates. With certain exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to federal, state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before June 30, 2017. (14)
Discontinued Operations On August 20, 2019, the Company announced plans to divest the product distribution businesses in Europe, the UK, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Peru and the Miami-based export operations ("Divestitures") as these businesses were performing below management's expectations. The Company continues to operate its digital business in these countries.
Management determined that the Company did not have sufficient scale in these markets
to maximize the value-added model for product distribution, leading the Company to focus and invest in its higher-growth, higher-margin businesses. Results from the Divestitures were included within each reportable segment, which includes the Specialty Technology Solutions and Modern Communications & Cloud segments. The Company signed an agreement on July 23, 2020 with Intcomex for its businesses located in Latin America, outside of Brazil. The Company finalized the sale of the Latin America businesses on
October 30, 2020. Th e Company also finalized the sale of the Europe and UK business on November 12, 2020. Total cash received for the sale of divestitures was $ 37.5  million. There were
no
components of net income or loss from discontinued operations for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022. During the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a gain from the sale of discontinued operations of $ 0.1  million. There were
no
assets or liabilities classified as held-for-sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. There were
no
cash flows from discontinued operations for the
six
months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021. 24 Table of Contents Item 2.

Gross Profit The following table summarizes our gross profit for the quarters and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:   Quarter ended December 31, % of Net Sales December 31,   2022 2021 $ Change % Change 2022 2021   (in thousands)       Specialty Technology Solutions $ 56,732   $ 52,048  $ 4,684  9.0  % 9.0   % 10.5  % Modern Communications & Cloud 58,602   55,605  2,997  5.4  % 15.3   % 15.1  % Gross profit $ 115,334   $ 107,653  $ 7,681  7.1  % 11.4   % 12.5  %   Six months ended December 31, % of Net Sales December 31,   2022 2021 $ Change % Change 2022 2021   (in thousands)       Specialty Technology Solutions $ 115,135   $ 97,742  $ 17,393  17.8  % 9.6   % 9.8  % Modern Communications & Cloud 113,683   111,483  2,200  2.0  % 15.1   % 15.4  % Gross profit $ 228,818   $ 209,225  $ 19,593  9.4  % 11.7   % 12.2  % Our gross profit is primarily affected by sales volume and gross margin mix. Gross margin mix is impacted by multiple factors, which include sales mix (proportion of sales of higher margin products or services relative to total sales), vendor program recognition (consisting of volume rebates, inventory price changes and purchase discounts) and freight costs. Increases in vendor program recognition decrease cost of goods sold, thereby increasing gross profit. Net sales derived from our Intelisys business contribute 100% to our gross profit dollars and margin as they have no associated cost of goods sold. Specialty Technology Solutions For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, gross profit dollars for the Specialty Technology Solutions segment increased $4.7 million, or 9.0%. Higher sales volume, after considering the associated cost of goods sold, contributed $13.7 million to the growth of gross profit dollars. Gross margin mix negatively impacted gross profit by $9.0 million, largely from a less favorable sales mix and decreased vendor program recognition. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the gross profit margin decreased 143 basis points over the prior-year to 9.0%. 27 Table of Contents For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Specialty Technology Solutions segment achieved gross profit growth of $17.4 million, or 17.8%. Increases in sales volume, after considering the associated cost of goods sold, contributed $20.1 million to the growth of gross profit dollars. Gross margin mix negatively impacted gross profit by $2.7 million, primarily from increased freight costs. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the gross profit margin decreased 22 basis points over the prior year to 9.6%. Modern Communications & Cloud For the
quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Modern Communications & Cloud segment gross profit increased by $3.0 million, or 5.4%. Higher sales volume, after considering the associated cost of goods sold, positively contributed $2.5 million to gross profit dollars. Gross margin mix positively impacted gross profit by $0.5 million, largely driven by a more favorable sales mix. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the gross profit margin increased 13 basis points over the prior year to 15.3%. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Modern Communications & Cloud segment achieved gross profit growth of $2.2 million, or 2.0%. Increases in sales volume, after considering the associated cost of goods sold, contributed $4.3 million to the growth of gross profit dollars. Gross margin mix negatively impacted gross profit by $2.1 million, primarily from increased freight costs. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the gross profit margin decreased 28 basis points over the prior year to 15.1%. Operating Expenses The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the quarters and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:   Quarter ended December 31, % of Net Sales December 31,   2022 2021 $ Change % Change 2022 2021   (in thousands)       Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 69,074   $ 69,161  $ (87) (0.1) % 6.8   % 8.0  % Depreciation expense 2,678   2,547  131  5.1  % 0.3   % 0.3  % Intangible amortization expense 4,150   4,447  (297) (6.7) % 0.4   % 0.5  % Operating expenses $ 75,902   $ 76,155  $ (253) (0.3) % 7.5   % 8.8  %   Six months ended December 31, % of Net Sales December 31,   2022 2021 $ Change % Change 2022 2021   (in thousands)       Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 140,667   $ 133,016  $ 7,651  5.8  % 7.2   % 7.7  % Depreciation expense 5,441   5,427  14  0.3  % 0.3   % 0.3  % Intangible amortization expense 8,391   8,956  (565) (6.3) % 0.4   % 0.5  % Operating expenses $ 154,499   $ 147,399  $ 7,100  4.8  % 7.9   % 8.6  % Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") decreased by less than $0.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior-year period. The decrease for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 is primarily attributable to a recovery of prior period withholding taxes in Brazil, which reduced SG&A by $2.9 million, partially offset by higher employee costs.
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, SG&A expenses increased by $7.7 million, or 5.8%, compared to the prior-year period. The increase for the six months ended December 31, 2022 is primarily attributable to higher employee costs, partially offset by a $2.9 million recovery of prior period withholding taxes in Brazil.

Operating margin decreased to 3.1% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, operating margin increased to 3.5%. The increase in operating income for the quarter and six month period is primarily due to higher gross profits. Modern Communications & Cloud For the Modern Communications & Cloud segment, operating income increased $4.9 million and $1.6 million for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the prior-year period. Operating margin increased to 5.1% and 4.4% for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The increase in operating income and margin for the quarter and six month period is primarily due to higher gross profits and a $2.9 million recovery of prior period withholding taxes in Brazil.
Corporate Corporate recognized no restructuring or divestiture expenses for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to less than $0.1 million in the prior-year quarter and six month period.

Interest expense increased for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior-year periods, primarily from higher borrowings and increases in interest rates on our multi-currency revolving credit facility. Interest income for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022 was generated on interest-bearing investments in Brazil and customer receivables.
Net foreign exchange gains and losses consist of foreign currency transactional and functional currency re-measurements, offset by net foreign currency exchange contract gains and losses. Foreign exchange gains and losses are generated as the result of fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Brazilian real, the U.S. dollar versus the euro, the British pound versus the euro, and the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. We partially offset foreign currency exposure with the use of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against these exposures. The costs associated with foreign exchange forward contracts are included in the net foreign exchange losses. Provision for Income Taxes For the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022, income tax expense was $10.5 million and $18.7 million reflecting an effective tax rate of 28.9% and 27.3%, respectively. In comparison, for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2021, income tax expense was $7.3 million and $14.6 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 23.9% and 24.4%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the quarter and six months is primarily due to a decrease in forecasted tax exempt income and a decrease in creditable foreign taxes compared to the prior-year quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 to be approximately 27.0% to 28.0%. See Note 13

Non-GAAP Financial Information Evaluating Financial Condition and Operating Performance In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("US GAAP" or "GAAP"), we also disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures include non-GAAP operating income; non-GAAP pre-tax income; non-GAAP net income; non-GAAP EPS; adjusted earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("adjusted EBITDA"); adjusted return on invested capital ("adjusted ROIC"); and constant currency. Constant currency is a measure that excludes the translation exchange impact from changes in
30 Table of Contents foreign currency exchange rates between reporting periods. We use non-GAAP financial measures to better understand and evaluate performance, including comparisons from period to period. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and the non-GAAP financial measures that we report may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. Analysis of results and outlook on a non-GAAP basis should be considered in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Adjusted Return on Invested Capital Adjusted ROIC assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operating performance. We believe the calculation of adjusted ROIC provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance during the year. Adjusted EBITDA starts with net income and adds back interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, and other non-GAAP adjustments. Since adjusted EBITDA excludes some non-cash costs of investing in our business and people, we believe that adjusted EBITDA shows the profitability from our business operations more clearly.
We calculate adjusted ROIC as adjusted EBITDA, divided by invested capital. Invested capital is defined as average equity plus average daily funded interest-bearing debt for the period. The following table summarizes annualized adjusted ROIC for the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively:     Quarter ended December 31,   2022 2021 Adjusted return on invested capital ratio, annualized
(a) 15.6   % 17.6  % (a) The annualized EBITDA amount is divided by days in the quarter times 365 days per year, or 366 days for leap year. There were 92 days in the current and prior-year quarter.

(b) Acquisition and divestiture costs are generally nondeductible for tax purposes. (c) Average funded debt is calculated as the daily average amounts outstanding on our short-term and long-term interest-bearing debt. Net Sales in Constant Currency, Excluding Acquisitions and Divestitures We make references to "constant currency," a non-GAAP performance measure that excludes the foreign exchange rate impact from fluctuations in the average foreign exchange rates between reporting periods. Constant currency is calculated by translating current period results from currencies other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using the comparable average foreign exchange rates from the prior year period. We also exclude the impact of acquisitions prior to the first full year of operations from the acquisition date in order to show net sales results on an organic basis.

Recovery of prior period withholding taxes in Brazil 36 Table of Contents Additional Non-GAAP Metrics
To evaluate current period performance on a more consistent basis with prior periods, we disclose non-GAAP SG&A expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP pre-tax income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Non-GAAP results exclude amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition and divestiture costs, restructuring costs, impact of Divestitures and other non-GAAP adjustments. These year-over-year metrics include the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These metrics are useful in assessing and understanding our operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods. Below we provide a non-GAAP reconciliation of the aforementioned metrics adjusted for the costs and charges mentioned above:

Recovery of prior period withholding taxes in Brazil 38 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our $350 million revolving credit facility. Our business requires significant investment in working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventory, partially financed through our accounts payable to vendors, cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit. In general, as our sales volumes increase, our net investment in working capital increases, which typically results in decreased cash flow from operating activities. Conversely, when sales volumes decrease, our net investment in working capital typically decreases, which typically results in increased cash flow from operating activities. Our cash and cash equivalents balance totaled $66.4 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $38.0 million at June 30, 2022, including $44.3 million and $35.0 million held outside of the United States at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Checks released but not yet cleared in the amounts of $8.9 million and $18.0 million are included in accounts payable at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
We conduct business in many locations throughout the world where we generate and use cash. We provide for United States income taxes from the earnings of our Canadian and Brazilian subsidiaries. See Note 13 -
Income Taxes
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Our net investment in working capital increased $172.8 million to $882.3 million at December 31, 2022 from $709.5 million at June 30, 2022, primarily from increases in accounts receivable and inventory. Our net investment in working capital is affected by several factors such as fluctuations in sales volume, net income, timing of collections from customers, increases and decreases to inventory levels and payments to vendors. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, our working capital investment increased to support our 13.6% year-over-year net sales growth. Six months ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ (75,346) $ (75,378) Investing activities (4,262) 480  Financing activities 108,029   51,365
Net cash used in operating activities was $75.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $75.4 million used in operating activities in the prior-year period. Cash used in operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 is attributable to increases in inventory and accounts receivable, which increased 24% and 7%, respectively, compared to the beginning of the six month period. Cash used in operating activities for the six months ended
December 31, 2021 is primarily attributable to increases in inventory and accounts receivable, which increased 20% and 8%, respectively, compared to the beginning of the
six
month period.
Operating cash flows are subject to variability period over period as a result of the timing of payments related to accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other working capital items. The number of days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 69 days at December 31, 2022, compared to 68 days at June 30, 2022 and 64 days at December 31, 2021. The increase in DSO for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to increased net receivables, driven by project specific customer terms and timing of sales near the end of the reporting period. Inventory turned 5.0 times during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to 5.1 times for previous quarter ended September 30, 2022 and 5.7 times in the prior-year quarter ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in inventory turns for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to increased average inventory. Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $4.3 million, compared to $0.5 million provided by investing activities in the prior-year period. Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 represents capital expenditures, primarily for IT investments. Cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended
December 31, 2021 represents proceeds from the sale of our discontinued operations, partially offset by capital expenditures. 39 Table of Contents Management expects capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 to range from $6.5 million to $9.0 million, primarily for IT investments and facility improvements. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by financing activities totaled $108.0 million, compared to $51.4 million provided by financing activities for the prior-year period. Cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021
is primarily attributable to net borrowings on the revolving credit facility.
Credit Facility We have a multi-currency senior secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of banks (as amended, the “Amended Credit Agreement”). On September 28, 2022, we amended and restated our Amended Credit Agreement, which includes (i) a five-year, $350 million multicurrency senior secured revolving credit facility and (ii) a five-year $150 million senior secured term loan facility. The Amended Credit Agreement extended the credit facility maturity date to September 28, 2027. In addition, pursuant to an “accordion feature,” we may increase our borrowings up to an additional $250 million, subject to obtaining additional credit commitments from the lenders participating in the increase. The Amended Credit Agreement allows for the issuance of up to $50 million for letters of credit. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic assets and our domestic subsidiaries. Under the terms of the revolving credit facility, the payment of cash dividends is restricted. We incurred debt issuance costs of $1.4 million in connection with the amendment and restatement of the Amended Credit Agreement. These costs were capitalized to other non-current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and added to the unamortized debt issuance costs from the previous credit facility. Loans denominated in U.S. dollars, other than swingline loans, shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, (i) the adjusted Term SOFR or adjusted daily simple SOFR plus an additional margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.75%, depending upon our ratio of (A) total consolidated debt less up to $30 million of unrestricted domestic cash to (B) trailing four-quarter consolidated EBITDA measured as of the end of the most recent year or quarter, as applicable, for which financial statements have been delivered to the Lenders (the “leverage ratio”); or (ii) the alternate base rate plus an additional margin ranging from 0% to 0.75%, depending upon our leverage ratio, plus, if applicable, certain mandatory costs. All swingline loans denominated in U.S. dollars shall bear interest based upon the adjusted daily simple SOFR, floating daily, plus an additional margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.75%, depending upon our leverage ratio, or such other rate as agreed upon with the applicable swingline lender. The adjusted term SOFR and adjusted daily simple SOFR include a fixed credit adjustment of 0.10% over the applicable SOFR reference rate. Loans denominated in foreign currencies shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable benchmark rate set forth in the New Credit Agreement plus an additional margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.75%, depending upon our leverage ratio, plus, if applicable, certain mandatory costs.
During the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2022, our borrowings under the credit facility were U.S. dollar loans. The spread in effect as of December 31, 2022 was 1.50% for LIBOR and SOFR-based loans and 0.50% for alternate base rate loans. The commitment fee rate in effect at December 31, 2022 was 0.25%. The Amended Credit Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants. Specifically, our Leverage Ratio must be less than or equal to 3.50 to 1.00 at all times. In addition, our Interest Coverage Ratio (as such term is defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) must be at least 3.00 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter. In the event of a default, customary remedies are available to the lenders, including acceleration and increased interest rates. We were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility at December 31, 2022.
The average daily outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility, excluding the term loan facility, during the six month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $219.5 million and $57.1 million, respectively. There was $120.0 million and $214.2 million available for additional borrowings as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. There were no letters of credit issued under the multi-currency revolving credit facility at December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022. Availability to use this borrowing capacity depends upon, among other things, the levels of our Leverage Ratio and Interest Coverage Ratio, which, in turn, will depend upon (1) our Credit Facility Net Debt relative to our Credit Facility EBITDA and (2) Credit Facility EBITDA relative to total interest expense, respectively. As a result, our availability will increase if EBITDA increases (subject to the limit of the facility) and decrease if EBITDA decreases. While we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022, and currently expect to continue to maintain such compliance, should we encounter difficulties, our historical relationship with our Credit Facility lending group has been strong and we anticipate their continued support of our long-term business. Summary 40 Table of Contents We believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities, supplemented as necessary with funds under our credit agreements, will provide sufficient resources to meet our present and future working capital and cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. We also believe that our longer-term working capital, planned expenditures and other general funding requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities.
