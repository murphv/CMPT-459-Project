NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Basis of Presentation Darden Restaurants, Inc. (we, our, Darden or the Company) owns and operates full-service dining restaurants in the United States and Canada under the trade names Olive Garden ® , LongHorn Steakhouse ® , Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen ® , Yard House ® , The Capital Grille ® , Seasons 52 ® , Bahama Breeze ® , Eddie V’s Prime Seafood ®
and The Capital Burger ® . As of November 27, 2022, through subsidiaries, we own and operate all of our restaurants in the United States and Canada, except for
2
joint venture restaurants managed by us and
34
franchised restaurants.
We also have
31
franchised restaurants in operation located in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Asia.
We have prepared these consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally presented in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and are of a normal recurring nature. We operate on a 52/53-week fiscal year which ends on the last Sunday in May. Our fiscal year ending May 28, 2023 will contain 52 weeks of operation.
Operating results for interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the full fiscal year. These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP.
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and costs and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
We have reclassified certain amounts in prior-period financial statements to conform to the current period’s presentation. COVID-19 Pandemic and Other Impacts to our Operating Environment During fiscal 2022, increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases throughout the United States including the Omicron variant which significantly impacted our restaurants in the third quarter, mostly in January 2022, subjected some of our restaurants to COVID-19-related restrictions such as mask and/or vaccine requirements for team members, guests or both.
Exclusions and quarantines of restaurant team members or groups thereof disrupt an individual restaurant’s operations and often come with little or no notice to the local restaurant management. During fiscal 2022, along with COVID-19, our operating results were impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic events, leading to higher than usual inflation on wages and other cost of goods sold. These events further impacted the availability of team members needed to staff our restaurants and caused additional disruptions in our product supply chain.
During fiscal 2023, these events have continued to impact our operating results as wage and cost inflation continue to exceed recent norms. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 and its variants, along with other geopolitical and macroeconomic events could lead to further capacity restrictions, mask and vaccination mandates, wage inflation, staffing challenges, product cost inflation and disruptions in the supply chain that impact our restaurants’ ability to obtain the products needed to support their operations.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), which requires annual disclosures that increase the transparency of transactions involving government grants, including (i) information about the nature of the transactions and related accounting policy used to account for the transactions; (ii) the line items on the balance sheet and income statement affected by these transactions including amounts applicable to each line; and (iii) significant terms and conditions of the transactions, including commitments and contingencies.
The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, but the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. 10 Table of Contents DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC.

million as of November 27, 2022 and May 29, 2022, respectively, which represents cash held as security for a standby letter of credit and cash held in escrow related to the sale of properties.
Restricted cash is included in Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets on the balance sheet. See Note 12, Commitments
and Contingencies, for further details around standby letters of credit.
Note 4. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for continuing operations for the quarter ended November 27, 2022 was
12.1
percent compared to an effective income tax rate for the quarter ended November 28, 2021 of
14.4
percent.
This change was primarily driven by the impact of federal tax credits and hedge mark-to-market impacts. The effective income tax rate for continuing operations for the six months ended November 27, 2022 was
13.0
percent compared to an effective income tax rate for the quarter ended November 28, 2021 of
13.4
percent.
This change was primarily driven by the impact of federal tax credits and lower net earnings from continuing operations. Included in our remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits is $ 7.9
million related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts could change within the next twelve months based on the outcome of examinations or as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions.
The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was enacted on August 16, 2022. The IRA includes provisions imposing a 1% excise tax on share repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022 and introduces a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax

The Other Business segment aggregates our remaining brands and includes the results of our company-owned Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze and The Capital Burger restaurants in the U.S and results from our franchise operations.
External sales are derived principally from food and beverage sales. We do not rely on any major customers as a source of sales, and the customers and long-lived assets of our reportable segments are predominantly in the U.S. There were no material transactions among reportable segments.
Our management uses segment profit as the measure for assessing performance of our segments. Segment profit includes revenues and expenses directly attributable to restaurant-level results of operations (sometimes referred to as restaurant-level earnings).
These expenses include food and beverage costs, restaurant labor costs, restaurant expenses and marketing expenses (collectively “restaurant and marketing expenses”). Non-cash lease-related expenses included in restaurant expenses (which is a component of segment profit) and lease-related depreciation and amortization are reported at the corporate level as these are expenses for which our operating segments are not being evaluated. Additionally, our lease-related right-of-use assets are not managed or evaluated at the operating segment level, but rather at the corporate level. 13 Table of Contents DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments as provided by FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and those utilized as economic hedges. We use financial derivatives to manage interest rate and compensation risks inherent in our business operations. Cash flows related to derivatives are included in operating activities. By using these instruments, we expose ourselves, from time to time, to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us. We minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates, commodity prices, or the market price of our common stock.
We minimize this market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. We designate commodity contracts and equity forward contracts as cash flow hedging instruments. Our interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related debt.
Further, we entered into equity forward contracts to hedge the risk of changes in future cash flows associated with recognized, employee-directed investments in Darden stock within the non-qualified deferred compensation plan. We did not elect hedge accounting with the expectation that changes in the fair value of the equity forward contracts would offset changes in the fair value of Darden stock investments in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The notional and fair values of our derivative contracts are as follows:   18 Table of Contents DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC.

(2) The fair value of equity forwards is based on the closing market value of Darden stock, inclusive of the risk of nonperformance. (3) The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is based on current and expected market interest rates, inclusive of the risk of nonperformance. The carrying value and fair value of long-term debt as of November 27, 2022, was $ 885.8  million and $ 839.9
million, respectively. The carrying value and fair value of long-term debt as of May 29, 2022, was $ 901.0
million and $ 896.9  million, respectively. The fair value of long-term debt, which is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, is determined based on market prices or, if market prices are not available, the present value of the underlying cash flows discounted at our incremental borrowing rates. The fair value of non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, is determined based on third-party market appraisals. As of November 27, 2022 and May 29, 2022, adjustments to the fair values of non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, classified as Level 2, were not material.
The fair value of non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, is determined based on appraisals, sales prices of comparable assets, or estimates of discounted future cash flows. As of November 27, 2022, adjustments to the fair values of non-financial assets, classified as Level 3, were not material.

Commitments and Contingencies As collateral for performance on contracts and as credit guarantees to banks and insurers, we are contingently liable for guarantees of subsidiary obligations under standby letters of credit. As of November 27, 2022 and May 29, 2022, we had $ 85.4
million and $ 104.8
million, respectively, of standby letters of credit related to workers’ compensation and general liabilities accrued in our consolidated financial statements. As of November 27, 2022 and May 29, 2022, we had $ 19.3
million and $ 18.8
million, respectively, of surety bonds related to other payments. Most surety bonds are renewable annually. As of November 27, 2022 and May 29, 2022, we had $ 91.4
million and $ 101.0
million, respectively, of guarantees associated with leased properties that have been assigned to third parties. These amounts represent the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees. The fair value of the maximum potential future payments discounted at our weighted-average cost of capital as of November 27, 2022 and May 29, 2022, amounted to $ 75.8
million and $ 83.6
million, respectively. In the event of default by a third party, the indemnity and default clauses in our assignment agreements govern our ability to recover from and pursue the third party for damages incurred as a result of its default. We do not hold any third-party assets as collateral related to these assignment agreements, except to the extent that the assignment allows us to repossess the building and personal property.
These guarantees expire over their respective lease terms, which range from fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2034. We are subject to private lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. A number of these lawsuits, proceedings and claims may exist at any given time. These matters typically involve claims from guests, employees and others related to operational issues common to the restaurant industry, and can also involve infringement of, or challenges to, our trademarks. While the resolution of a lawsuit, proceeding or claim may have an impact on our financial results for the period in which it is resolved, we believe that the final disposition of the lawsuits, proceedings and claims in which we are currently involved, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.   Note 13.

COVID-19 Pandemic During fiscal 2022, increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases throughout the United States including the Omicron variant which significantly impacted our restaurants in the third quarter, mostly in January 2022, subjected some of our restaurants to COVID-19-related restrictions such as mask and/or vaccine requirements for team members, guests or both.
Exclusions and quarantines of restaurant team members or groups thereof disrupt an individual restaurant’s operations and often come with little or no notice to the local restaurant management. During fiscal 2022, along with COVID-19, our operating results were impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic events, leading to higher than usual inflation on wages and other cost of goods sold. These events further impacted the availability of team members needed to staff our restaurants and caused additional disruptions in our product supply chain.
During fiscal 2023, these events have continued to impact our operating results as wage and cost inflation continue to exceed recent norms. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 and its variants, along with other geopolitical and macroeconomic events could lead to further capacity restrictions, mask and vaccination mandates, wage inflation, staffing challenges, product cost inflation and disruptions in the supply chain that impact our restaurants’ ability to obtain the products needed to support their operations.
Financial Highlights - Consolidated                                                                                         • Total sales increased 9.4% and 7.7% to $2.49 billion and $4.93 billion for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2023 compared to $2.27 billion and $4.58 billion for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2022 driven by blended same-restaurant sales increases of 7.3% and 5.7% and sales from 35 net new restaurants. • Our net earnings from continuing operations were $187.5 million and $381.1 million for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2023 compared to $193.4 million and $425.1 million for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2022. • Reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.52 and $3.09 for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2023 compared to $1.48 and $3.24 for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2022.      Outlook We expect sales for fiscal 2023 to be between $10.3 and $10.45 billion, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 5.0 to 6.5 percent and 55 to 60 new restaurant openings.
Additionally, we expect capital expenditures incurred to build new restaurants, remodel and maintain existing restaurants and for technology initiatives to be $525 to $575 million. 24 Table of Contents

This change was primarily driven by the impact of federal tax credits and hedge mark-to-market impacts. The effective income tax rate for continuing operations for the six months ended November 27, 2022 was 13.0 percent compared to an effective income tax rate for the quarter ended November 28, 2021 of 13.4 percent.
This change was primarily driven by the impact of federal tax credits and lower net earnings from continuing operations. The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was enacted on August 16, 2022. The IRA includes provisions imposing a 1% excise tax on share repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022 and introduces a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) on adjusted financial statement income. The CAMT will be effective for us beginning in fiscal 2024. We currently are not expecting the IRA to have a material adverse impact to our financial statements. LOSSES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On an after-tax basis, losses from discontinued operations for the second quarter and six months ended of fiscal 2023 were $0.3 million ($0.00 per diluted share) and 0.9 million ($(0.01) per diluted share) compared with losses from discontinued operations for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2022 of $0.2 million ($0.00 per diluted share) and 1.0 million ($(0.01) per diluted share).
SEGMENT RESULTS We manage our restaurant brands, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze, Eddie V’s and The Capital Burger in North America as operating segments. We aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size, economic characteristics and sub-segment of full-service dining within which each brand operates. Our four reportable segments are: (1) Olive Garden, (2) LongHorn Steakhouse, (3) Fine Dining and (4) Other Business (see Note 6 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report).
Our management uses segment profit as the measure for assessing performance of our segments. The following table presents segment profit margin for the periods indicated. Three Months Ended Six Months Ended Segment November 27, 2022 November 28, 2021 Change November 27, 2022 November 28, 2021 Change Olive Garden 18.6% 21.8% (320) BPS 18.9% 22.5% (360)  BPS LongHorn Steakhouse 14.3% 15.3% (100) BPS 14.7% 17.1% (240)  BPS Fine Dining 19.3% 21.0% (170) BPS 17.9% 20.5% (260)  BPS Other Business 11.6% 13.6% (200) BPS 12.7% 15.7% (300)  BPS The decrease in Olive Garden and LongHorn’s segment profit margin for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2023 was driven primarily by food and beverage costs partially offset by positive same-restaurant sales.
The decrease in Fine Dining and Other Business’ segment profit margin for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2023 was driven primarily by food and beverage and restaurant labor costs partially offset by positive same-restaurant sales.
SEASONALITY Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally. Typically, our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring, followed by the summer, and lowest in the fall.
Holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather, effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Typically, cash flows generated from operating activities are our principal source of liquidity, which we use to finance capital expenditures for new restaurants and to remodel and maintain existing restaurants, to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock. Since substantially all of our sales are for cash and cash equivalents, and accounts payable are generally paid in 5 to 90 days, we are typically able to carry current liabilities in excess of current assets.
27 We currently manage our business and financial ratios to target an investment-grade bond rating, which has historically allowed flexible access to financing at reasonable costs. Our publicly issued long-term debt currently carries the following ratings: • Moody’s Investors Service “Baa2”;
• Standard & Poor’s “BBB”; and • Fitch “BBB”.
Our commercial paper has ratings of: • Moody’s Investors Service “P-2”;
• Standard & Poor’s “A-2”; and
• Fitch “F-2”.
These ratings are as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q and have been obtained with the understanding that Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch will continue to monitor our credit and make future adjustments to these ratings to the extent warranted. The ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities, may be changed, superseded or withdrawn at any time and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. On September 10, 2021, we entered into a $1 billion Revolving Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. (BOA), as administrative agent, and the lenders and other agents party thereto. The Revolving Credit Agreement is a senior unsecured credit commitment to the Company and contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants (including limitations on liens and subsidiary debt and a maximum consolidated lease adjusted total debt to total capitalization ratio of 0.75 to 1.00) and events of default usual for credit facilities of this type.
As of November 27, 2022, we had no outstanding balances and were in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement.
As of November 27, 2022, $58.0 million of commercial paper was outstanding, which was backed by this facility.
After consideration of commercial paper backed by the Revolving Credit Agreement, as of November 27, 2022, we had $942.0 million of credit available under the Revolving Credit Agreement.
The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on September 10, 2026, and the proceeds may be used for working capital and capital expenditures, the refinancing of certain indebtedness, certain acquisitions and general corporate purposes.
Loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin determined by reference to a ratings-based pricing grid (Applicable Margin), or the base rate (which is defined as the highest of the BOA prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus 0.500 percent, and the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00 percent) plus the Applicable Margin. Assuming a “BBB” equivalent credit rating level, the Applicable Margin under the Revolving Credit Agreement will be 1.000 percent for LIBOR loans and 0.000 percent for base rate loans.
As of November 27, 2022, our outstanding long-term debt consisted principally of: • $500.0 million of unsecured 3.850 percent senior notes due in May 2027; • $96.3 million of unsecured 6.000 percent senior notes due in August 2035; • $42.8 million of unsecured 6.800 percent senior notes due in October 2037; and • $300.0 million of unsecured 4.550 percent senior notes due in February 2048. The interest rate on our $42.8 million senior notes due in October 2037 is subject to adjustment from time to time if the debt rating assigned to such series of notes is downgraded below a certain rating level (or subsequently upgraded). The maximum adjustment is 2.000 percent above the initial interest rate and the interest rate cannot be reduced below the initial interest rate. As of November 27, 2022, no such adjustments are made to this rate. We may from time to time repurchase our remaining outstanding debt in privately negotiated transactions. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and other factors. From time to time we enter into interest rate derivative instruments. See Note 10 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report, which is incorporated by reference.
Net cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased to $635.6 million for the six months of fiscal 2023, from $481.5 million for the six months of fiscal 2022. Net cash flows provided by operating activities include net earnings from continuing operations of $381.1 million and $425.1 million in the six months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Net cash flows provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2023 primarily due to the change in working capital compared to fiscal 2022 offset by lower net earnings from continuing operations.
Net cash flows used in investing activities of continuing operations were $273.4 million for the six months of fiscal 2023, compared to $177.8 million for the six months of fiscal 2022.
Capital expenditures increased to $280.3 million for the six
28 months of fiscal 2023 from $173.3 million for the six months of fiscal 2022 reflecting an increase in new restaurant construction and remodel activity during fiscal 2023. Net cash flows used in financing activities of continuing operations were $534.9 million for the six months of fiscal 2023, compared to $721.0 million for the six months of fiscal 2022.
Net cash flows used in financing activities for the six months of fiscal 2023 included dividends paid of $296.5 million, share repurchases of $299.2 million, and repayments of short-term debt of $253.5 million partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of short-term debt. Net cash flows used in financing activities for the six months of fiscal 2022 included dividends paid of $286.1 million and share repurchases of $452.3 million partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.
Dividends declared by our Board of Directors totaled $2.42 and $2.20 per share for the six months of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.
On June 22, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $1 billion of our outstanding common stock.
This repurchase program does not have an expiration and replaces the existing share repurchase authorization.
During the quarter and six months ended November 27, 2022, we repurchased 0.76 million and 2.4 million shares of our common stock, respectively, compared to 1.8 million and 3.1 million shares of our common stock, respectively, during the quarter and six months ended November 28, 2021.
We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, sales, costs or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Impairment of our assets, including goodwill or trademarks, adversely affects our financial position and results of operations, and our leverage ratio for purposes of our Revolving Credit Agreement. A leverage ratio exceeding the maximum permitted under our Revolving Credit Agreement would be a default under our Revolving Credit Agreement.  At November 27, 2022, write-downs of goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets, or any other assets in excess of approximately $824.7 million would have been required to cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum. As our leverage ratio is determined on a quarterly basis, and due to the seasonal nature of our business, a lesser amount of impairment in future quarters could cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum.
FINANCIAL CONDITION Our current assets totaled $892.1 million as of November 27, 2022, compared to $1.18 billion as of May 29, 2022.
The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in prepaid income taxes as well as cash and cash equivalents. Our current liabilities totaled $1.91 billion as of November 27, 2022, compared to $1.85 billion as of May 29, 2022.
The increase was primarily driven by an increase in accounts payable and short-term debt, offset by a decrease in accrued payroll. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales, costs and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We have discussed the development, selection and disclosure of those estimates with the Audit Committee. Our critical accounting estimates have not changed materially from those previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022.

Any of the risks described above or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the SEC could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. Therefore, the above is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, compensation and commodity prices. To manage this exposure, we periodically enter into interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, equity forward and commodity derivative instruments for other than trading purposes (see Note 10 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report). We use the variance/covariance method to measure value at risk, over time horizons ranging from one week to one year, at the 95 percent confidence level. As of November 27, 2022, our potential losses in future net earnings resulting from changes in equity forwards, commodity instruments and floating rate debt interest rate exposures were approximately $74.5 million over a period of one year. The value at risk from an increase in the fair value of all of our long-term fixed-rate debt, over a period of one year, was approximately $82.4 million. The fair value of our long-term fixed-rate debt outstanding as of November 27, 2022, averaged $851.9 million, with a high of $893.7 million and a low of $798.0 million during the six months of fiscal 2023. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows by targeting an appropriate mix of variable and fixed-rate debt. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of November 27, 2022, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of November 27, 2022. During the fiscal quarter ended November 27, 2022, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 31 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1.
