Skyline Champion Corporation
Notes to Condensed Consoli dated Financial Statements
1.
Basis of Presentation and Business Nature of Operations:
Skyline Champion Corporation's (the “Company”) operations consist of manufacturing, retail and transportation activities. At December 31, 2022, the Company operated
37
manufacturing facilities throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and
five
manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. In addition to its core home building business, the Company provides construction services to install and set-up factory-built homes. The Company’s retail operations consist of
31
sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers across the U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada and manufactured houses in certain regions of the U.S. The Company also has a holding company located in the Netherlands. Basis of Presentation:
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 24, 2022 (the “Fiscal 2022 Annual Report”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated income statements, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2023,” will end on April 1, 2023 and will include 52 weeks. References to “fiscal 2022” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended April 2, 2022. The three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 included 13 and 39 weeks, respectively.
The Company’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. Accounts receivable are reflected net of reserves of
$ 2.1
million
and
$ 1.7
million
at December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, respectively. At both December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, other notes receivable are reflected net of reserves of
$ 0.4
million . In May 2022, the Company acquired certain operating assets from Manis Custom Builders, Inc. ("Manis"). In July 2022, the Company acquired
12
Factory Expo retail sales centers from Alta Cima Corporation. The purchase price and net assets acquired for both transactions were not material to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. There were no accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

On July 7, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $ 200.0
million, including a $ 45.0
million letter of credit sub-facility ("Amended Credit Agreement"). The Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Company's previously existing $ 100.0
million revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings of $ 26.9
million on the Company's previous revolving credit facility were repaid in July 2021. The Amended Credit Agreement allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available facility during the term, subject to certain terms and conditions, matures in
July 2026 , and has no scheduled amortization. The Company capitalized $ 1.1
million of deferred financing fees associated with the Amended Credit Agreement, which are included in other noncurrent assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company wrote off $ 0.3
million of deferred financing fees associated with the previously existing credit facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2022.

Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued   The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement adjusts based on the consolidated total net leverage of the Company from a high of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (" LIBOR") or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus the benchmark replacement adjustment ("Replacement Rate") plus
1.875 % and
Alternative Base Rate (" ABR") plus
0.875 %, at the election of the Company, when the consolidated total net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than
2.25 :1.00, to a low of LIBOR or the Replacement Rate plus
1.125 % and ABR plus
0.125 % when the consolidated total net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between
0.15 % and
0.3 % (depending on the consolidated total net leverage ratio) in respect of unused commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. There were
no
outstanding borrowings under the revo lving credit facility at December 31, 2022 and April, 2, 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2022
the interest rate under the Amended Credit Agreement was 5.60% and letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Agreement totaled $ 32.1
million.
Available borrowing capacity under the Amended Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022 was
$ 167.9
million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at December 31, 2022, including related costs and fees, was
5.25 %. T he industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in
2029 .   The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022. Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations historically utilized floor plan financing to fund the purchase of manufactured homes for display or resale. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company repaid all of its outstanding floor plan borrowings. At April 2, 2022, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing of
$ 35.5
million. Total credit line capacity provided under the agreements wa s $ 70.0
million
as of December 31, 2022 . Under floor plan financing,
borrowings are secured by the financed homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer.

Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments primarily based on net sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets.
The Company operates in
two
reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily includes cash and U.S. deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment.     11

Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on its agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is significantly reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase and is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. Based on these repurchase agreements and our historical loss experience, we established an associated loss reserve which was
$ 2.6
million
and
$ 2.3
million
at December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, respectively. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of December 31, 2022 was estimated to be
$ 399.4
million . Losses incurred on homes repurchased were not significant during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 or January 1, 2022.   12
Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued   At December 31, 2022 , the Company was contingently obligated for $ 32.1
million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of
$ 12.6
million to support long-term debt, $ 19.2
million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3
million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued from a sub-facility of the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for
$ 30.8
million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. The Company has received claims for damage related to water intrusion in homes built in one of its manufacturing facilities. The Company is investigating the cause of the damage and assessing its responsibility to remediate. While it is reasonably possible that the Company will receive future claims that could result in additional costs to repair that could be significant in the aggregate, the Company is unable to estimate the number of such claims or the amount or range of any potential losses associated with such claims at this time.
In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to
12 years
from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Item 2.
MANAGEMENT’
S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Report.
Overview
Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including company-owned retail locations, transportation logistics services, and construction services to install and set-up factory-built homes. The Company markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Atlantic Homes, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 37 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed, manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 31 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers across the U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles, and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada.
Acquisitions and Expansions
Over the last several years, demand for the Company’s products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to increase capacity utilization and profitability at its existing manufacturing facilities as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprint through facility and equipment investments and acquisitions. The Company continues to focus on growing in strong housing markets across the U.S. and Canada, as well as expanding products and services to provide more holistic solutions to homebuyers.
In July 2022, the Company acquired 12 Factory Expo retail sales centers from Alta Cima Corporation, which expanded the internal retail network across a broader portion of the U.S. In May 2022, the Company acquired Manis Custom Builders, Inc. ("Manis") in order to expand its manufacturing footprint and further streamline its product offering in the Southeast U.S. On February 28, 2021, the Company acquired ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies (collectively, "Scotbilt"), which operated two manufacturing facilities in Georgia providing affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. The ScotBilt acquisition complemented the Company’s prior manufacturing footprint in the attractive mid-south region.
The Company is also focused on streamlining its U.S. manufacturing production capacity through various plant start-ups. In June 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Navasota, Texas in order to increase its production capabilities in the Texas market. The Company began production at one of those facilities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. In January 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Pembroke, North Carolina, and is currently certifying one of those facilities for production in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company is also in the process of opening previously idled facilities in Bartow, Florida and Decatur, Indiana, both of which are expecting to begin production in fiscal 2024.
The Company's acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations through streamlining production of similar product categories. These acquisitions and investments are included in the Company's consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates.
Industry and Company Outlook
Since July 2020, the U.S. and Canadian housing industry demand has generally been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has driven demand for new homes in those markets. In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the U.S., including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 55 years of age, the population of first-time homebuyers, and the population of households earning less than $60,000 per year. More recently, we have seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of accessory dwelling units ("ADUs") and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options.
Recent increases in interest rates in response to inflation have impacted the demand for the Company's products in both the U.S. and Canada. Incoming orders from our manufacturing customers decreased compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, our independent retail customers have cancelled stock-model orders in response to the increase in floor plan carrying costs and the desire to optimize their model home inventory based on rising interest rates. The Company's backlog was $532.0 million as of December 31, 2022 compared to $1.5 billion as of January 1, 2022. The decrease in backlog is due to the year-over-year decrease in net orders and higher production volumes during fiscal 2023 compared to last year. Cancellation of end-consumer orders, at the retail level, have been minimal.
14
The robust demand for housing in 2021 and the first half of 2022 resulted in significant increases in certain raw material and labor costs. Although we have seen recent improvements in raw material costs and availability, we continue to experience intermittent disruption and higher freight costs. Finding and retaining qualified labor continues to be a challenge for our plants which requires us to monitor our compensation programs and adjust accordingly. We manage our business to anticipate or quickly react to these supply challenges and cost increases and generally are able to pass along increased costs to our customers.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, approximately 88% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") code construction standard in the U.S. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes are reported on a one-month lag. According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute, HUD-code industry home shipments were 76,802 and 71,281 units during the eight months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on industry data, the Company’s U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 20.9% and 19.4%, for the eight months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Annual HUD-code industry shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually.

Net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $582.3 million, an increase of $47.6 million, or 8.9%, compared to the three months ended January 1, 2022. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.
U.S. Factory-built Housing:
Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $57.5 million, or 11.9%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended January 1, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in average home selling price of 13.5%, partially offset by a decrease in homes sold of 1.4%. The decrease in the number of homes sold was a result of lower customer orders and production volume, partially offset by additional capacity from recent acquisitions and expansions. The average selling price increase was due to pricing actions previously enacted on our products in response to rising material, freight, and labor costs. Generally, we have been able to pass the increase in input costs to our customers.
Canadian Factory-built Housing:
The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $5.6 million, or 15.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 18.8% decrease in homes sold, partially offset by a 4.5% increase in average home selling price. The increase in average selling price was due to pricing actions previously enacted in response to rising material and labor costs. The decrease in homes sold is due to slowing housing demand in certain regions of Canada and a shift in mix. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $2.3 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year.
Corporate/Other:
Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, net sales decreased $4.3 million, or 32.1%, primarily attributable to the decrease in home and recreational vehicle shipments.

Net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $2,115.0 million, an increase of $545.9 million, or 34.8%, compared to the nine months ended January 1, 2022. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment.
U.S. Factory-built Housing:
Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $543.8 million, or 38.5%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended January 1, 2022. The increase was primarily due to a 9.6% increase in the number of homes sold during the period, as well as a 26.4% increase in the average home selling price. The increase in the number of homes sold was a result of utilizing additional capacity from recent acquisitions and expansions, FEMA Disaster Relief housing sales and increased production output from our existing facilities. The average selling price increase was due, in part, to the impact of sales to FEMA of $200.3 million as well as to pricing actions on our core products taken in response to rising material, freight, and labor costs. FEMA units generally have more specifications than our typical products and therefore drive a higher average selling price per home.
Canadian Factory-built Housing:
The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $2.4 million, or 2.1% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 18.7% increase in average home selling price, partially offset by a 14.0% decrease in homes sold. The increase in average selling price was due to pricing actions previously taken in response to rising material and labor costs and a change in product mix. The decrease in homes sold is due to slowing demand in certain regions of Canada and a shift in mix. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $5.1 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year.
Corporate/Other:
Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net sales decreased $0.3 million, or 0.6%.

U.S. Factory-built Housing:
Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $269.3 million, or 75.0%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit was 32.1% as a percent of segment net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 25.4% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit was due to a combination of higher volumes and sales prices for our products. In addition, sales to FEMA during the first half of fiscal 2023 increased margins since these sales are generally at higher prices than our core products, which helps offset the disruption to our operations and our customers.
Canadian Factory-built Housing:
Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $9.0 million, or 32.8% during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 31.5% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 24.2% in the same period of the prior year.
The increase in gross profit was due to higher average selling prices of our homes and lower material input costs.
Corporate/Other:
Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased $1.1 million, or 9.7%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Gross profit increased as a percent of segment net sales to 29.9% from 27.0% due to revenue mix in the Company's transportation business.

Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $468.9 million, an increase of $236.4 million from the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily a result of higher operating income due to increases in sales volume, average selling prices and gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.
The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus, (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest income or expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) restructuring charges and impairment of assets, and (f) other non-operating income and costs, including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that, in the future, the Company may incur expenses similar to those adjusted for in this presentation. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an implication that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
Adjusted EBITDA:
• does not reflect the interest expense on our debt;
• excludes impairments; and
• does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
• although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and
• other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
Given these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only on a supplemental basis.

BACKLOG
Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at December 31, 2022 totaled $532.0 million compared to $1.5 billion at January 1, 2022. The decrease in backlog was primarily driven by higher production rates and lower net orders. Recent increases in interest rates in response to inflation has impacted the demand for the Company's products in both the U.S. and Canada. Incoming gross orders from our customers decreased compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, our independent retail customers have cancelled stock-model orders in response to the increase in floor plan carrying costs and the desire to optimize their model home inventory. Cancellation of end-consumer orders, at the retail level, has been minimal.

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flows from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives and investments. The Company has an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility ("Amended Credit Agreement"). At December 31, 2022, $167.9 million was available for borrowing under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes (i) a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00, subject to an upward adjustment upon the consummation of a material acquisition, and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. The Company anticipates compliance with its debt covenants and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year and beyond. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise its operating strategies.
Cash provided by operating activities was $364.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $164.4 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2022. Cash provided by operating activities increased due to higher net income and higher cash generated from working capital items.
Cash used in investing activities was $44.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $22.9 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2022. The increase in cash used for investing activities was related to net cash paid for acquisitions and higher capital expenditures to support plant expansion and ongoing maintenance.
Cash used in financing activities was $36.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to cash used in financing activities of $21.4 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2022. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the Company's repayment of all oustanding floor plan borrowings in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.
