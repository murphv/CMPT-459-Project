Republic First Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)
Note
1:
Basis of Presentation
Republic First Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a
one -bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Its wholly owned subsidiary, Republic First Bank, does business under the name of Republic Bank (“Republic”). Republic is a Pennsylvania state-chartered bank that offers a variety of banking services to individuals and businesses throughout the Greater Philadelphia, Southern New Jersey, and New York City markets through its offices and branch locations in Philadelphia, Montgomery, Delaware and Bucks Counties in Pennsylvania, Camden, Burlington, Atlantic and Gloucester Counties, New Jersey and New York County. In
2016,
Republic acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Oak Mortgage Company, LLC (“Oak Mortgage”) and, as a result, Oak Mortgage became a wholly owned subsidiary of Republic on that date. In
2018,
Oak Mortgage was merged with and into Republic and restructured as a division of Republic. The Oak Mortgage name is still utilized for marketing and branding purposes. The Company also has
two
unconsolidated subsidiaries, which are statutory trusts established by the Company in connection with its sponsorship of
two
separate issuances of trust preferred securities.
The Company and Republic encounter vigorous competition for market share in the geographic areas they serve from bank holding companies, national, regional, and other community banks, thrift institutions, credit unions and other non-bank financial organizations, such as mutual fund companies, insurance companies and brokerage companies.
The Company and Republic are subject to federal and state regulations governing virtually all aspects of their activities, including but
not
limited to, lines of business, liquidity, investments, the payment of dividends and others. Such regulations and the cost of adherence to such regulations can have a significant impact on earnings and financial condition.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Republic. The Company follows accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”).  The FASB sets accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) that are followed to ensure consistent reporting of financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. All material inter-company transactions have been eliminated. Events occurring subsequent to the date of the balance sheet have been evaluated for potential recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Form
10 -Q and Article
10
of SEC Regulation S- X.   Accordingly, they do
not
include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for financial statements for a complete fiscal year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the
three - and
nine -month periods ended
September 30, 2022
are
not
necessarily indicative of the results that
may
be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2022
or for any other period.
Note
2:
Correction of Immaterial Errors in Previously Filed Financial Statements
Subsequent to filing the Form
10 -Qs for both the
first
and
second
quarters of
2022,
the Company identified certain errors related to the previously reported allowance for credit losses (the “ACL”) and related provision for credit losses for the reporting periods ended
March 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022.
Based on a total mix of factors, the Company concluded that the errors were immaterial to the unaudited financial statements for the reporting periods ended
March 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022.
As such, the errors have been corrected within this filing.
8
The correction of the immaterial errors in the Company’s previously reported allowance for credit losses and related provision for credit losses relate to the implementation of the Company’s new allowance methodology in connection with the adoption of ASU
2016 - 13,
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic
326 ): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
(“CECL”) in
2022.
Specifically, the adjustments correct the calculation of historical loss data, improper loan portfolio segmentation, and the exclusion of off-balance sheet commitments from the allowance calculation. As a result, the Company’s provision for credit losses, loans receivable, other liabilities (which contains the ACL on off-balance sheet commitments), and other assets (which contains net deferred tax assets) for the quarters ended
March 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022
were corrected.
The Company also corrected an immaterial error for an under accrual of legal fees for the quarter ended
March 31, 2022,
increasing other liabilities and legal expenses. The Company also adjusted other assets which contains net current tax assets. Such legal fees were subsequently paid in the quarter ended
June 30, 2022.
The Company assessed both the qualitative and quantitative factors individually and in aggregate with the other immaterial corrections noted above and determined the error was immaterial both individually and in aggregate.
For the
three
months ended
March 31, 2022,
the corrected net income is $ 6.2
million, or $ 0.08
per diluted share, which is $ 0.1
million, or $ 0.00
per diluted share, higher than previously reported. For the
three
months ended
June 30, 2022,
the corrected net income is $ 4.0
million, or $ 0.05
per diluted share, which is $ 0.5
million, or $ 0.01
per diluted share, lower than as previously reported. The impacts of the correction on the
March 31, 2022
and
June 30, 2022
financial statements are further illustrated below.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Risks and Uncertainties
The earnings of the Company depend primarily on the earnings of Republic. The earnings of Republic are heavily dependent upon the level of net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the interest paid on its interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Accordingly, the Company’s results of operations are subject to risks and uncertainties surrounding Republic’s exposure to changes in the interest rate environment. Prepayments on residential real estate mortgage and other fixed rate loans and mortgage-backed securities vary significantly and
may
cause significant fluctuations in interest margins.
The coronavirus (“COVID- 19” ) outbreak and the public health response to contain it resulted in unprecedented economic and financial market conditions. Additionally, more recent geopolitical (including the conflict in Ukraine), inflationary pressures, interest rate hikes by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) and potential recessionary conditions have added even further uncertainty to the overall economic environment. During
2022,
the federal funds target range increased by
425
basis points to a range of
4.25%
-
4.50%
to curb inflation, with continued increases planned.
The effects of geopolitical conflict, inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and potential recessionary conditions
may
meaningfully impact loan production, income levels, and the measurement of certain significant estimates such the allowance for credit losses.  Moreover, if in a period of economic contraction, elevated levels of credit losses and reduced interest income
may
occur.  The extent to which the economic environment impacts the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as the Company's regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the current economic environment and actions taken by governmental authorities and other
third
parties in response to geopolitical conflict and inflationary pressures.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
19
Significant estimates are made by management in determining the allowance for credit losses and the realization of deferred income tax assets. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates.
Mortgage Banking Activities and Mortgage Loans Held for Sale
Mortgage loans held for sale are originated and held until sold to permanent investors. Management elected to adopt the fair value option in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , and record loans held for sale at fair value.
Mortgage loans held for sale originated on or subsequent to the election of the fair value option are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value is determined on a recurring basis by utilizing quoted prices from dealers in such securities. Changes in fair value are reflected in mortgage banking income in the statements of income. Direct loan origination costs are recognized when incurred and are included in non-interest expense in the statements of income.
Interest Rate Lock Commitments
Mortgage loan commitments known as interest rate locks that relate to the origination of a mortgage that will be held for sale upon funding are considered derivative instruments under the derivatives and hedging accounting guidance in FASB ASC
815,
Derivatives and Hedging . Loan commitments that are classified as derivatives are recognized at fair value on the balance sheet as other assets and other liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded as mortgage banking income and included in non-interest income in the statements of income. Outstanding interest rate lock commitments (“IRLCs”) are subject to interest rate risk and related price risk during the period from the date of issuance through the date of loan funding, cancellation, or expiration. Loan commitments generally range between
30
and
90
days; however, the borrower is
not
obligated to obtain the loan. Republic is subject to fallout risk related to IRLCs, which is realized if approved borrowers choose
not
to close on the loans within the terms of the IRLCs. Republic uses best efforts commitments to substantially eliminate these risks. The valuation of the IRLCs issued by Republic includes the value of the servicing released premium. Republic sells loans where the servicing is released, and the servicing released premium is included in the market price. See Note
12:
Derivatives and Risk Management Activities for further detail of IRLCs.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates are made by management in determining the allowance for credit losses for in-scope financial instruments including investments of debt securities, loans, unfunded commitments, and the realization of deferred income tax assets. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates.
In estimating the allowance for credit losses, management considers current economic conditions, past loss experience, the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, results of internal loan reviews and regulatory examinations, borrowers perceived financial and managerial strengths, the adequacy of underlying collateral, if collateral dependent, or present value of future cash flows, and other relevant and qualitative risk factors. Subsequent to foreclosure, an estimate for the carrying value of other real estate owned is normally determined through valuations that are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less the cost to sell. Because the allowance for credit losses and carrying value of other real estate owned are dependent, to a great extent, on the general economy and other conditions that
may
be beyond Republic’s control, the estimates of the allowance for credit losses and the carrying values of other real estate owned could differ materially in the near term.

The Company adopted ASU
2016 - 13,
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic
326 ): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
for their current expected credit losses effective
January 1, 2022.
Our implementation process included, among other things, assessment and documentation of governance and reporting processes and related internal controls; model development, documentation and validation; and the incorporation of qualitative adjustments for model limitations.  ASU
2016 - 13
lists several credit loss methods that are acceptable such as a discounted cash flow method, loss-rate method and probability of default/loss given default (“PD/LGD”).  We contracted with a
third -party vendor to assist us in the application of ASU
2016 - 13
and utilize various methodologies such as Cohort and Weighted Average Remaining Maturity to estimate the allowance for credit losses.
In evaluating the Company’s ability to recover deferred tax assets, management considers available positive and negative evidence, including the past operating results and forecasts of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, management makes assumptions for the amount of taxable income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require management to make judgments about the future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the business. A material reduction in estimated future taxable income
may
require management to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. The establishment of or an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on future earnings.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has a Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the
“2005
Plan”), under which the Company granted options, restricted stock or stock appreciation rights to the Company’s employees, directors, and certain consultants. Under the terms of the
2005
Plan,
1.5
million shares of common stock, plus an annual increase equal to the number of shares needed to restore the maximum number of shares that could be available for grant under the
2005
Plan to
1.5
million shares, were available for such grants. As of
September 30, 2022,
the only grants outstanding under the
2005
Plan were option grants. The
2005
Plan provided that the exercise price of each option granted equaled the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of the grant. Options granted pursuant to the
2005
Plan vest within
one
to
four
years and have a maximum term of
10
years. The
2005
Plan terminated on
November 14, 2015.
On
April 29, 2014,
the Company’s shareholders approved the Republic First Bancorp, Inc.
2014
Equity Incentive Plan (the
“2014
Plan”), under which the Company
may
grant options, restricted stock, stock units, or stock appreciation rights to the Company’s employees, directors, independent contractors, and consultants.  Under the terms of the
2014
Plan,
2.6
million shares of common stock, plus an annual adjustment to be
no
less than
10 % of the outstanding shares or such lower number as the Board of Directors
may
determine, are available for such grants. Compensation cost for all awards is calculated and recognized over the vesting period of the awards. If the service conditions are
not
met, the Company reverses previously recorded compensation expense upon forfeiture. The Company’s accounting policy election is to recognize forfeitures as they occur. At
September 30, 2022,
the maximum number of common shares issuable under the
2014
Plan was
6.5
million shares. During the
nine
months ended
September 30, 2022,
714,167
stock units were granted under the
2014
Plan with a fair value of $ 3.7
million.

Equity Incentive Plan (the
“2021
Plan”), under which the Company
may
grant options, restricted stock, stock units, or stock appreciation rights to the Company’s employees, directors, independent contractors, and consultants. Under the terms of the
2021
Plan, the maximum number of shares which
may
be issued or awarded is
7.5
million shares of common stock. As of

Earnings per Share
Earnings per share (“EPS”) consists of
two
separate components: basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for each period presented. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus dilutive common stock equivalents (“CSEs”). CSEs consist of units and convertible preferred stock/dilutive stock options granted through the Company’s stock option plans for the
three - and
nine -months ended
September 30, 2022
and
September 30, 2021.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
ASU
2016 - 13
The Company adopted ASU
2016 - 13,
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic
326 ): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
for their current expected credit losses (“CECL”) effective
January 1, 2022.
Our implementation process included, among other things, assessment and documentation of governance and reporting processes and related internal controls; model development, documentation and validation; and the incorporation of qualitative adjustments for model limitations. ASU
2016 - 13
lists several credit loss methods that are acceptable such as a discounted cash flow method, loss-rate method and probability of default/loss given default (“PD/LGD”). We contracted with a
third -party vendor to assist us in the application of ASU
2016 - 13
and utilize various methodologies such as Cohort and Weighted Average Remaining Maturity to estimate the allowance for credit losses.
Section
4014
of the CARES Act provided financial institutions with optional temporary relief from having to comply with ASU
2016 - 13,
including the CECL methodology for estimating the allowance for credit losses. This temporary relief was set to expire on the earlier of the date on which the national emergency concerning COVID- 19
terminated or
December 31, 2020,
with adoption being effective retrospectively as of
January 1, 2020.
25
Section
540
of the Consolidated Appropriations Act,
2021,
amended Section
4014
of the CARES Act by extending the relief period provided in the CARES Act. The Consolidated Appropriations Act,
2021,
modified the CARES Act so that temporary relief will expire on the earlier of the
first
day of the fiscal year that begins after the date on which the national emergency concerning COVID- 19
terminates or
January 1, 2022.
The Company elected to delay the implementation of ASU
2016 - 13
following the approval of the CARES Act and continued to use the incurred loss methodology for estimating the allowance for credit losses in
2020
and
2021.
ASU
2016 - 13
requires financial institutions to calculate an allowance utilizing a reasonable and supportable forecast period, which the Company has established as a
one -year period. In the unprecedented circumstances surrounding the COVID- 19
pandemic and the response thereto, the Company believed that adopting ASU
2016 - 13
in the
first
quarter of
2020
would have added an unnecessary level of subjectivity and volatility to the calculation of the allowance for credit losses. With the approval of the Consolidated Appropriations Act,
2021,
management elected to delay adoption of ASU
2016 - 13
to
January 1, 2022.
This allowed the Company to utilize the CECL standard for the entire year of adoption.
The Company adopted ASC
326
using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance-sheet (OBS) credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after
January 1, 2022
are presented under ASC
326
while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The Company recorded a net decrease to retained earnings of $ 3.6
million as of
January 1, 2022
for the cumulative effect of adopting ASC
326.

Reference Rate Reform (Topic
848 ): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.
The ASU provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or derecognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. Specifically, the amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. These relate only to those contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The ASU became effective as of
March 12, 2020
and can be adopted anytime during the period of
January 1, 2020
through
December 31, 2022.
There is only

Commitments and Contingencies
The Company and Republic are from time to time parties (plaintiff or defendant) to lawsuits in the normal course of business. While any litigation involves an element of uncertainty, management is of the opinion that the liability of the Company and Republic, if any, resulting from such actions will
not
have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company and Republic, except as noted below.
On
September 19, 2022,
a complaint was filed in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania against the Company and its then Interim Chief Executive Officer and director and
two
other current directors.  The lawsuit is styled  Vernon Hill et al. v. Lisa Jacobs, et al.,  Case
No.
220901684.
The complaint was amended on
December 12, 2022.
The
two
plaintiffs, the former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and a former director of the Company, allege defamation, defamation per se and false light against the
three
individual defendants. The amended complaint includes
three
additional allegations by the former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, alleging fraudulent inducement (against Madonna and Wildstein), fraudulent concealment (against Madonna, Jacobs and Wildstein), and unjust enrichment (against the Company). The former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer also alleges a breach of his employment agreement by the Company. The complaint seeks certain reimbursement payments and compensatory and (as against the individual defendants) punitive damages.  The defendants all filed Preliminary Objections to the complaint, as well as to the amended complaint, and discovery has commenced. On
February 27, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed papers opposing the Preliminary Objections, and briefing of those Objections is ongoing.  The matter is in its early stages and, accordingly, the Company is still assessing the potential outcomes and materiality of the matter.  The Company plans to defend itself vigorously.
27
On
November 22, 2022,
shareholders George E. Norcross, III, Gregory B. Braca and Philip A. Norcross filed a complaint in the same Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas against the Company and its directors.  The lawsuit, captioned  George E. Norcross, III, et al. v. Republic First Bancorp, Inc.  Case
No.
221102195,
alleges generally that the Company and its Board have acted in violation of their fiduciary duties by rejecting Plaintiffs’ efforts to nominate Mr. Braca as a director candidate at its
2022
annual meeting of shareholders.  The Company rejected that attempted nomination on grounds that the plaintiff who made the nomination was
not
a stockholder of record, as the Company’s By-Laws require.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief that includes a demand that the Court waive enforcement of the Company’s By-Laws, reopen the deadline for nominating director candidates or find that the defendants violated the Company’s By-Laws in connection with its appointment of director Benjamin Duster to fill a vacancy on the Board. On
December 6, 2022,
plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction and asked defendants to accept service of the complaint, which they have done.  Following a status conference on
January 18, 2023,
a hearing on the preliminary injunction motion was scheduled for
April 25, 2023,
and the Company was ordered
not
to hold any shareholder vote with regard to any vacancy on its board of directors until
May 31, 2023,
at the earliest. Given its early stage, the Company cannot predict potential outcomes of the matter or plaintiffs’ motion; however, the defendants deny the alleged wrongdoing and intend to defend the matter vigorously.
On
November 28, 2022,
Plaintiffs Vernon Hill (“Hill”) and Interarch, Inc. (“Interarch”) filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, captioned  Hill and Interarch v. Republic First Bancorp, Inc. et al. ,
No.
2:22 -cv- 04735,
and they filed an amended complaint on
February 10, 2023.
Hill is a former Republic First Bancorp, Inc. (“Republic”) board chair and Chief Executive Officer and a former Republic director.  Interarch, owned by Hill’s wife, Shirley Hill, provided certain branding and architecture services to Republic.  Plaintiffs Hill and Interarch bring claims against Defendants Republic and
two
Republic employees (who are former Interarch employees), Rodney Dean (“Dean”) and John Chessa (“Chessa”).  Plaintiff Interarch brings claims for copyright infringement (against Republic), , breach of contract (against Republic), and breach of the duty of loyalty (against Dean and Chessa).  Hill, in turn, brings a claim for trademark infringement (against Republic) and violation of Hill’s right of publicity (against Republic). Hill and Interarch together bring claims for unjust enrichment (against Republic), unfair competition (against Republic), misappropriation of trade secrets under federal and state law (against all Defendants), misappropriation of trade secrets under federal and state law (against all Defendants), misappropriation of confidential information under state law (against all Defendants), tortious interference (against Republic) and a request for a declaratory judgment relating to these claims (against all Defendants).  This matter is in its early stages, and Republic is assessing the potential outcome and materiality of this matter.  The Company intends to defend itself vigorously.

Collateralized mortgage obligations and agency mortgage-backed securities have expected maturities that differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay with or without prepayment penalties and, therefore, these securities are classified separately with
no
specific maturity date.

The Company’s investment securities portfolio consists primarily of debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies, U.S. government-sponsored agencies, state governments, local municipalities and certain corporate entities. Equity securities consist of investments in non-cumulative preferred stock. There were
no
private label mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) or collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”) held in the investment securities portfolio as of
September 30, 2022
or
December 31, 2021.
There was also
no
MBS or CMO securities that were rated “Alt-A” or “sub-prime” as of those dates.
The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. Net unrealized gains and losses in the available for sale portfolio are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. Securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than the amortized cost basis. The adoption of CECL on
January 1, 2022
resulted in
no
impact to the held-to-maturity securities portfolio, as the Company’s entire portfolio consists of securities guaranteed by various agencies or government-sponsored enterprises and carries
no
risk of nonpayment.
The Company evaluates investment securities that are in an unrealized/unrecognized loss position on a quarterly basis and more frequently when warranted in order to determine if the decline in fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset. Accounting standards require the evaluation of the discounted cash flows when estimating expected credit losses to determine if a credit loss has occurred. In the event of a credit loss, that amount must be recognized against income in the current period. The portion of the unrealized loss related to other factors, such as liquidity conditions in the market or the current interest rate environment, is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for investment securities classified available for sale. There were
no
credit-related impairment charges recognized in net income during the
nine
months ended
September 30, 2022
or the year ended
December 31, 2021.

Unrealized/unrecognized losses on securities in the investment portfolio amounted to $ 499.1
million with a total fair value of $ 2.3
billion as of
September 30, 2022
compared to unrealized/unrecognized losses of $ 36.1
million with a total fair value of $ 2.1
billion as of
December 31, 2021.
The Company believes the unrealized/unrecognized losses presented in the tables above are primarily related to market interest rates or limited trading activity in a particular type of security rather than the underlying credit quality of the issuers. The Company does
not
currently intend to sell or believe it will be required to sell securities in an unrealized/unrecognized loss position prior to maturity or recovery of the amortized cost bases.
The Company held
17
U.S. Government agency securities,
103
collateralized mortgage obligations and
103
agency mortgage-backed securities that were in an unrealized/unrecognized loss position as of
September 30, 2022.
Principal and interest payments of the underlying collateral for each of these securities are backed by U.S. Government sponsored agencies and carry minimal credit risk. Management found
no
evidence of losses related to credit factors on any of these securities and believes the unrealized/unrecognized losses are due to fluctuations in fair values resulting from changes in market interest rates as of
September 30, 2022.
31
All municipal securities held in the investment portfolio are reviewed on least a quarterly basis for impairment. Each bond carries an investment grade rating by either Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s. In addition, the Company periodically conducts its own independent review on each issuer to ensure the financial stability of the municipal entity. The largest geographic concentration was in New Jersey and consisted of either general obligation or revenue bonds backed by the taxing power of the issuing municipality. As of
September 30, 2022,
the investment portfolio included
15
municipal securities that were in an unrealized loss position.
On
September 30, 2022,
the investment portfolio included
22
corporate bonds that were in an unrealized loss position. Management believes the unrealized losses on these securities were also driven by changes in market interest rates and
not
a result of credit deterioration.
Proceeds associated with the sale of securities available for sale during the
three
and
nine
months ended
September 30, 2022
were each $ 34.1  million. The tax provision applicable to the net loss of $ 46,000
for the
three
and
nine
months ended
September 30, 2022
each amounted to
$ 12,000 .
There were
no
proceeds from the sale of securities during the
three
or
nine
months ended
September 30, 2021.
There was
no
allowance for credit losses recorded for debt securities available for sale at either
September 30, 2022
or
December 31, 2021.
Additionally, for the
three
and
nine
months ended
September 30, 2022
and

there was
no
credit-related investment impairment losses recognized.

The Company disaggregates its loan portfolio into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics for purposes of estimating the allowance for credit losses. The Company’s loan groups include commercial real estate, construction and land development, commercial and industrial, owner-occupied real estate, consumer, residential mortgages and Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans, which are fully guaranteed by the U.S. Government and as such have
no
allowance associated with them. The loan groups are also considered classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics.
32
The performance and credit quality of the loan portfolio is also monitored by analyzing the age of the loans receivable as determined by the length of time a recorded payment is past due. The following table presents the classes of the loan portfolio summarized by the past due status as of
September 30, 2022

Credit Quality Indicators:
The Company places all commercial loans into various credit risk rating categories based on an assessment of the expected ability of the borrowers to properly service their debt. The assessment considers numerous factors including, but
not
limited to, current financial information on the borrower, historical payment experience, strength of any guarantor, nature of and value of any collateral, acceptability of the loan structure and documentation, relevant public information, and current economic trends. This credit risk rating analysis is performed when the loan is initially underwritten and then annually based on set criteria in the loan policy. The Company uses the following regulatory definitions for criticized and classified risk ratings:
Special Mention:
These loans have a potential weakness that deserves Management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, the potential weaknesses
may
result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loans or of the institution’s credit position at some future date.
Substandard:
These loans are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are
not
corrected.
Doubtful:
These loans have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, based on currently existing facts, conditions, and values.
33
Loans
not
meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above-described process are considered to be pass-rated loans.
The following table presents the classes of the loan portfolio summarized by the amortized cost basis by origination year and the aggregate pass rating and the classified ratings of special mention, substandard and doubtful within the Company’s internal risk rating system as of

Troubled Debt Restructurings
A modification to the contractual terms of a loan that results in a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty is classified as a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”). The concessions made in a TDR are those that would
not
otherwise be considered for a borrower or collateral with similar risk characteristics. A TDR is typically the result of efforts to minimize potential losses that
may
be incurred during loan workouts, foreclosure, or repossession of collateral at a time when collateral values are declining. Concessions include a reduction in the interest rate below current market rates, a material extension of time to the loan term or amortization period, partial forgiveness of the outstanding principal balance, acceptance of interest only payments for a period of time, or a combination of any of these conditions.
Pursuant to the CARES Act, loan modifications made between
March 1, 2020
and the earlier of i)
December 30, 2020
or ii)
60
days after the President declares a termination of the COVID- 19
national emergency were
not
classified as TDRs if the related loans were
not
more than
30
days past due as of
December 31, 2019.
In
December 2020,
the Economic Aid Act was signed into law, which extended the period to suspend the requirements under TDR accounting guidance to the earlier of i)
January 1, 2022
or ii)
60
days after the President declared a termination of the national emergency related to the COVID- 19
pandemic. As of
September 30, 2022
and
December 31, 2021,
there were
no
loan customers deferring loan payments, and all customers that were granted deferrals to assist during the COVID pandemic have resumed contractual payments. All TDRs are considered impaired and are therefore individually evaluated for impairment in the calculation of the allowance for credit losses. Some TDRs
may
not
ultimately result in the full collection of principal and interest as restructured and could lead to potential incremental losses. These potential incremental losses would be factored into the Company’s estimate of the allowance for credit losses. The level of any subsequent defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions.
There were
no
loan modifications made during the
three
and
nine
months ended
September 30, 2022
or
September 30, 2021
that met the criteria of a TDR.
After a loan is determined to be a TDR, the Company continues to track its performance under the most recent restructured terms. There were
no
TDRs that subsequently defaulted during the
three
and
nine
months ended
September 30, 2022.
There were
no
TDRs that subsequently defaulted during the year ended
December 31, 2021.
The last remaining TDR on the Company’s books was paid off in full during
2021.
There were
no
residential mortgages in the process of foreclosure as of
September 30, 2022.
There was
one
residential mortgage in the process of foreclosure at
December 31, 2021.
There was
no
other real estate owned relating to residential real estate as of
September 30, 2022
and
December 31, 2021.

and $ 1.3
billion at
December 31, 2021.
At
September 30, 2022,
we had outstanding overnight borrowings totaling $ 442.5

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any estimation technique.  Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are
not
necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could have realized in a sales transaction on the dates indicated.  The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of their respective year-ends and have
not
been re-evaluated or updated for purposes of these financial statements subsequent to those respective dates.  As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates
may
be different than the amounts reported at each year-end.
The Company follows the guidance issued under ASC
820,
Fair Value Measurement,
which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and identifies required disclosures on fair value measurements.
ASC
820
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level
1
measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level
3
measurements).  The
three
levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC
820
are as follows:
Level
1 : Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
Level
2 : Quoted prices in markets that are
not
active, or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level
3 : Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported with little or
no
market activity).
An asset or liability’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
40
For financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy used as of
September 30, 2022
and
December 31, 2021
were as follows:

The range and weighted average of qualitative factors such as economic conditions and estimated liquidation expenses are presented as a percent of the appraised value.
( 4 )
The valuation technique is determined based on estimated insurance proceeds and litigation.
43
The significant unobservable inputs for impaired loans and other real estate owned are the appraised value or an agreed upon sales price. These values are adjusted for estimated costs to sell which are incremental direct costs to transact a sale such as broker commissions, legal fees, closing costs and title transfer fees. The costs must be considered essential to the sale and would
not
have been incurred if the decision to sell had
not
been made. The costs to sell are based on costs associated with the Company’s actual sales of other real estate owned which are assessed annually.
Fair Value Assumptions
The following information should
not
be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only provided for a limited portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities.  Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company’s disclosures and those of other companies
may
not
be meaningful.  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments as of
September 30, 2022
and
December  31,
2021.
Investment Securities
The fair value of investment securities available for sale (carried at fair value) and held to maturity (carried at amortized cost) are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level  1 ), or matrix pricing (Level
2 ), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value investment securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted prices.  For certain securities, which are
not
traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence (Level
3 ).  In the absence of such evidence, management’s best estimate is used.  Management’s best estimate consists of both internal and external support on certain Level
3
investments.  Internal cash flow models using a present value formula that includes assumptions market participants would use along with indicative exit pricing obtained from broker/dealers (where available) were used to support fair values of certain Level
3
investments. The fair value of equity securities (carried at fair value) is determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level  1 ).
The types of instruments valued based on matrix pricing in active markets include all of the Company’s U.S. government and agency securities, corporate bonds, and municipal obligations held in the investment securities portfolio. Such instruments are generally classified within Level
2
of the fair value hierarchy. As required by ASC
820 - 10,
the Company does
not
adjust the matrix pricing for such instruments.
Level
3
is for positions that are
not
traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions and
may
be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, with such adjustment generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management’s best estimate is used. Subsequent to inception, management only changes Level
3
inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments, completed or pending
third -party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in the equity or debt markets, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows. Republic has
one
Level
3
investment classified as available for sale which is a single corporate bond.
The corporate bond included in Level
3
was transferred from Level
2
in
2010
and is
not
actively traded. Impairment would depend on the repayment ability of the underlying issuer, which is assessed through a detailed quarterly review of the issuer’s financial statements. The issuer is a “well capitalized” financial institution as defined by federal banking regulations and has demonstrated the ability to raise additional capital, when necessary, through the public capital markets. The fair value of this corporate bond is estimated by obtaining a price of a comparable floating rate debt instrument through Bloomberg.
44
Mortgage Loans Held for Sale (Carried at Fair Value)
The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is determined by obtaining prices at which they could be sold in the principal market at the measurement date and are classified within Level
2
of the fair value hierarchy. Republic elected to adopt the fair value option for its mortgage loans held for sale portfolio in order to more accurately reflect their economic value. Interest income on loans held for sale, which totaled $ 392,000
and $ 728,000
for
three
and
nine
months ended
September 30, 2022,
respectively, and $ 123,000
and $ 599,000
for the
three
and
nine
months ended
September 30, 2021,
respectively, are included in interest and fees in the statements of income.
The following table reflects the difference between the carrying amount of mortgage loans held for sale, measured at fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal amount that Republic is contractually entitled to receive at maturity as of
June 30, 2022
and
December 31, 2021 ( dollars in thousands):
Carrying

Principal Balance
Excess Carrying

September 30, 2022
$ 6,038     $ 5,994     $ 44
December 31, 2021
$ 8,538     $ 8,241     $ 297
Changes in the excess carrying amount over aggregate unpaid principal balance are recorded in the statement of income in mortgage banking income. As of
September 30, 2022,
Republic had
no
mortgage loans held for sale recorded at fair value that was
90
or more days past due and on non-accrual. Republic did
not
have any mortgage loans held for sale recorded at fair value that were
90
or more days past due and on non-accrual as of
December 31, 2021.
Interest Rate Lock Commitments
The Company determines the value of IRLC’s by comparing the market price to the price locked in with the customer, adding fees or points to be collected at closing, subtracting commissions to be paid at closing, and subtracting estimated remaining loan origination costs to the bank based on the processing status of the loan, The Company also considers pull-through as it determines the fair value of IRLC’s. Factors that affect pull-through rates include the origination channel, current mortgage interest rates in the market versus the interest rate incorporated in the IRLC, the purpose of the mortgage (purchase versus financing), the stage of completion of the underlying application and underwriting process, and the time remaining until the IRLC expires. IRLCs are classified within Level
2
of the valuation hierarchy.
Best Efforts Forward Loan Sales Commitments
Best efforts forward loan sales commitments are classified within Level
2
of the valuation hierarchy. Best efforts forward loan sales commitments fix the forward sales price that will be realized upon the sale of mortgage loans into the secondary market. Best efforts forward loan sales commitments are entered into for loans at the time the borrower commitment is made. These best-efforts forward loan sales commitments are valued using the committed price to the counterparty against the current market price of the interest rate lock commitment or mortgage loan held for sale.
Mandatory Forward Loan Sales Commitments
Fair values for mandatory forward loan sales commitments are based on fair values of the underlying mortgage loans and the probability of such commitments being exercised. Due to the observable inputs used by Republic, best efforts mandatory loan sales commitments are classified within Level
2
of the valuation hierarchy.
45
Individually Evaluated Collateral Dependent Loans
When a loan is individually evaluated, it is valued at the lower of cost or fair value. Collateral dependent loans which are individually evaluated and carried at fair value have been partially charged off or receive specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses. For collateral dependent loans, fair value is generally based on real estate appraisals. These appraisals
may
utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including the comparable sales approach and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments result in a Level
3
classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Additionally, updated independent appraisals valuations are obtained annually for all collateral dependent loans.
Other Real Estate Owned (Carried at Lower of Cost or Fair Value)
These assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is determined through valuations periodically performed by
third -party appraisers, and the real estate is carried at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Any declines in the fair value of the real estate properties below the initial cost basis are recorded through a valuation expense. At
September 30, 2022
and
December 31, 2021,
these assets are carried at current fair value and classified within Level
3
of the fair value hierarchy.
SBA Servicing Asset (Carried at Fair Value)
The SBA servicing asset is initially recorded when loans are sold, and the servicing rights are retained and recorded on the balance sheet. An updated fair value is obtained from an independent
third
party on a quarterly basis and adjustments are presented as loan and servicing fees on the statement of income. The valuation begins with the projection of future cash flows for each asset based on their unique characteristics, the Company’s market-based assumptions for prepayment speeds and estimated losses and recoveries. The present value of the future cash flows is then calculated utilizing the Company’s market-based discount ratio assumptions. In all cases, the Company models expected payments for every loan for each quarterly period in order to create the most detailed cash flow stream possible.
The Company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the impairment of the SBA servicing asset. These assumptions include prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved and comparable to assumptions used by participants to value and bid serving rights available for sale in the market. As of
September 30, 2022
and
December 31, 2021,
the sensitivity of the current fair value of the SBA loan servicing rights to immediate
10%
and
20 % adverse changes in key assumptions are included in the accompanying table.

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should
not
be considered to be predictive of future performance. As indicated, changes in value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in value
may
not
be linear. Also in this table, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the value of the SBA servicing rights is calculated without changing any other assumption. While in reality, changes in
one
factor
may
magnify or counteract the effect of the change.
Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments (Disclosed at notional amounts)
Fair values for the Company’s off-balance sheet financial instruments (lending commitments and letters of credit) are based on fees currently charged in the market to enter into similar agreements, taking into account, the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties’ credit standing.
The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments as of
September 30, 2022
were as follows.

The fair value of Republic’s IRLCs, best efforts forward loan sales commitments, and mandatory forward loan sales commitments are based upon the estimated value of the underlying mortgage loan (determined consistent with “Loans Held for Sale”), adjusted for ( 1 ) estimated costs to complete and originate the loan, and ( 2 ) the estimated percentage of IRLCs that will result in a closed mortgage loan. The valuation of the IRLCs issued by Republic includes the value of the servicing released premium. Republic sells loans servicing released, and the servicing released premium is included in the market price.

Leases
We have operating lease agreements for certain land, buildings, and equipment. In some instances, a lease
may
contain renewal options to extend the term of the lease. We do
not
have any short-term leases in the calculation of the right-of-use assets and lease liability obligations. The most significant assumption related to the Company’s lease application of ASC
842
was the discount rate assumption. Since most of the lease agreements do
not
provide an implicit interest rate, the discount rate used in determining the operating lease liability obligation for each individual lease was the assumed incremental borrowing rate for the Company that corresponded with the remaining lease term.
As of
September 30, 2022,
the Company had
39
operating lease agreements, which include operating leases for
21
branch locations,
six
offices that are used for general office space, and
twelve
operating leases for equipment. Four of the real property operating leases did
not
include
one
or more options to extend the lease term. Eight of the operating leases for branch locations are land leases where the Company is responsible for the construction of the building on the property. The
39
operating leases have maturity dates ranging from
December 2022
to
August 2059.
Most of the property leases include options for multiple
five
and
ten
year extensions that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.
No
operating leases include variable lease payments that are based on an index or rate, such as the CPI. The weighted average remaining operating lease term for these leases is
18.7
years as of
September 30, 2022.
The weighted average operating lease discount rate was
3.38 % as of
September 30, 2022.
As of
September 30, 2021,
the Company had
44
operating lease agreements, which include operating leases for
twenty
branch locations,
seven
offices that are used for general office space, and
seventeen
operating leases for equipment. Two of the real property operating leases did
not
include
one
or more options to extend the lease term. Eight of the operating leases for branch locations are land leases where the Company is responsible for the construction of the building on the property. The
44
operating leases have maturity dates ranging from
December 2021

Most of the property leases include options for multiple

Subsequent Events
On
December 22, 2022,
Mr. Madonna resigned from his position as Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  Under his employment agreement, upon his resignation, Mr. Madonna was entitled to receive a severance payment of $ 1.59
million (subject to reduction for the amount paid to Mr. Madonna to reimburse him for the cost of life insurance), and
five
years of continued health benefits. The Company recognized such expense on
December 22, 2022.
The Company reassessed classification of certain investments, and effective
December 2022,
the Company transferred approximately $ 90  million of agency debenture bonds from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity securities. The transfer of these securities was accounted for at fair value. These securities had an unrealized loss of $ 29  million at the transfer date, which was reflected as a discount on the date of transfer. This discount, as well as the related unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income, will be amortized into interest income as a yield adjustment through earnings over the remaining term of the securities. The amortization of the unrealized holding loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the discount.  No  gains or losses were recorded at the time of transfer.
On
March 10, 2023
the Company announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with certain accredited investors for a private placement of equity securities of the Company (the “Capital Raise”) in the aggregate amount of $ 125.0
million at a purchase price of $ 2.25
per share of common stock equivalent securities. Affiliates of Castle Creek Capital (together with its affiliates and co-investors, “Castle Creek”), has committed to participate in the Capital Raise for an aggregate amount of $ 60.725
million. The consummation of the Capital Raise is conditioned on other accredited investors committing to purchase an additional $ 34.275
million on the same terms.
The Capital Raise includes (i) Common Stock of the Company, par value $ 0.01
per share (“Common Stock”), (ii) Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.01
(“Series B Preferred Stock”), authorized by the Board through the Company’s existing blank check preferred provision, which will have
no
voting rights and be economically equivalent to
10
shares of Common Stock and which, upon the authorization of the Non-Voting Common Stock, will automatically convert into
10
shares of Non-Voting Common Stock for each share of Series B Preferred Stock, (iii) Non-voting common stock of the Company, par value $ 0.01
(“Non-Voting Common Stock”), to be authorized and issued post-closing upon receipt of shareholder approval and which
may
be converted into Common Stock at the option of the holder if, following such conversion, the holder will own
no
more than
9.9 % of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or in connection with specified permitted transfers, and (iv) Warrants issued to Castle Creek to purchase Series B Preferred Stock/Non-Voting Common Stock as further described below (“Warrants” and together with the Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock, the “Securities”).
At closing, in exchange for the cash consideration of $ 2.25
per share of Common Stock equivalent securities on an as-converted basis, the Company will issue to each purchaser a mix of voting Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock agreed by the Company and the purchaser. In consideration of Castle Creek’s role as the anchor investor, the Company will also issue to Castle Creek a Warrant for
1,300,000
shares of Non-Voting Common Stock (or equivalent Series B Preferred Stock) with a strike price of $ 2.25
per share of Non-Voting Common Stock. The Warrant has a
seven -year term and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments for non-cash dividends, non-cash distributions, stock splits, subdivisions, reclassifications or combinations of Common Stock. Additionally, Cohen Private Ventures is contributing approximately $ 30
million of the total proceeds. The Capital Raise is expected to close in
May 2023.
In
2020,
the Company purchased $ 5.0
million of Signature Bank
5.00 % Non-cumulative Perpetual Series A Preferred Stock.  The preferred stock is treated as an equity security on the Company’s balance sheet at the security’s fair value, which was $ 3.5
million at
September 30, 2022.
On
March 12, 2023,
Signature Bank was closed by the New York State Department of Financial Services and was taken into receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  The value of the Signature Bank preferred securities will depend on whether another financial institution agrees to acquire Signature Bank or if Signature Bank is ultimately liquidated, which cannot be determined at this time.  In the event of a liquidation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act specifies the order in which claims will be paid under the receivership, which prioritizes secured claims and the payment of deposits in front of debt and security holders.

ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT ’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following is management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.
We may from time to time make written or oral “forward-looking statements,” including statements contained in this quarterly report. The forward-looking statements contained herein are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.  For example, risks and uncertainties can arise with changes in: general economic conditions, including turmoil in the financial markets and related efforts of government agencies to stabilize the financial system; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operation; geopolitical conflict and inflationary pressures including Federal Reserve interest rate hikes; the effect of potential recessionary conditions; the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and our methodology for determining such allowance; adverse changes in our loan portfolio and credit risk-related losses and expenses; concentrations within our loan portfolio, including our exposure to commercial real estate loans; inflation; changes to our primary service area; changes in interest rates; our ability to identify, negotiate, secure and develop new branch locations and renew, modify, or terminate leases or dispose of properties for existing branch locations effectively; business conditions in the financial services industry, including competitive pressure among financial services companies, new service and product offerings by competitors, price pressures and similar items; deposit flows; loan demand; the regulatory environment, including evolving banking industry standards, changes in legislation or regulation; our securities portfolio and the valuation of our securities; change in accounting principles, policies and guidelines as well as estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements; rapidly changing technology; our ability to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5250(c)(1) and 5620(a); the failure to maintain current technologies; failure to attract or retain key employees; our ability to access cost-effective funding; fluctuations in real estate values; litigation liabilities, including costs, expenses, settlements and judgments; and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services.  You should carefully review the risk factors described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The words "would be," "could be," "should be," "probability," "risk," "target," "objective," "may," "will," "estimate," "project," "believe," "intend," "anticipate," "plan," "seek," "expect" and similar expressions or variations on such expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

Executive Summary
Republic First Bancorp, Inc. was organized and incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1987 and is the holding company for Republic First Bank, which does business under the name Republic Bank. We offer a variety of credit and depository banking services to individuals and businesses primarily in Greater Philadelphia, Southern New Jersey, and New York City through our offices and branch locations in those markets.
As of September 30, 2022, we serve our customers through 34 branch locations, in addition to four loan offices that specialize in commercial, small business and residential mortgage lending. It is our goal to deliver best in class customer service across all delivery channels including not only our physical branch locations, but through online and mobile options as well.
54
Economic Environment
The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak and the public health response to contain it resulted in unprecedented economic and financial market conditions. Additionally, more recent geopolitical (including the conflict in Ukraine), inflationary pressures, interest rate hikes by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) and potential recessionary conditions have added even further uncertainty to the overall economic environment. During 2022, the federal funds target range increased by 425 basis points to a range of 4.25% - 4.50% to curb inflation, with continued increases planned.
The effects of geopolitical conflict, inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and potential recessionary conditions may meaningfully impact loan production, income levels, asset quality and the measurement of certain significant estimates such the allowance for credit losses. Moreover, if in a period of economic contraction, elevated levels of credit losses and reduced interest income may occur. The extent to which the economic environment impacts the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as the Company's regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the current economic environment and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to geopolitical conflict and inflationary pressures.
Loss Mitigation and Loan Portfolio Analysis
We take a proactive approach to analyzing and preparing for the potential challenges faced by the effects of the current economic environment on our customers. A detailed analysis of loan concentrations and segments that may present the areas of highest risk has been prepared and continues to be closely monitored. Our lending team is dedicated to working with our loan customers to discuss the impact that the economic environment has had on them or their businesses and the expected ramifications that could be felt in the future. We are ready to provide assistance as necessary such as loan modifications and payment deferral plans for customers that have an immediate need for assistance.
As a result of the changes in economic conditions cited above, we also continue to monitor levels of qualitative factors for certain components of Republic’s allowance for credit loss calculation. We believe the combination of ongoing communication with our customers, lower loan-to-value ratios on underlying collateral, loan payment deferrals and, increased focus on risk management practices should help mitigate potential future period losses. We will continue to closely monitor all key economic indicators and our internal asset quality metrics as the effects of inflationary pressures continue. Based on the current expected credit loss methodology currently utilized by Republic, the provision for credit losses and charge-offs may be impacted in future periods, but more time is needed to fully understand the magnitude and severity of the economic downturn and the full impact on our loan portfolio.
Financial Condition
Assets
Total assets increased by $372.6 million, or 7%, to $6.00 billion as of September 30, 2022, compared to $5.63 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in assets was primarily due to an increase in loans receivable of 22%. In addition to the ongoing success with our expansion strategy, the growth in assets was also driven by our participation in the PPP loan program, which resulted in a significant increase in new business relationships and deposit account openings.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits comprise this category, which consists of our most liquid assets. The aggregate amount in these categories decreased by $66.4 million to $52.5 million as of September 30, 2022, compared to $118.9 million as of December 31, 2021 as excess cash was used to fund loan originations and security purchases.
55
Loans Held for Sale
Loans held for sale are comprised of loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and residential mortgage loans, both of which we intend to sell in the future. Total SBA loans held for sale were $4.8 million as of September 30, 2022 as compared to $5.2 million as of December 31, 2021. Residential mortgage loans held for sale were $6.0 million at September 30, 2022, a decrease of $2.5 million, versus $8.5 million at December 31, 2021. A decrease in the volume of residential mortgage loans originated during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 due to the higher interest rate environment drove the decrease in residential mortgage loans held for sale compared to December 31, 2021. Loans held for sale as a percentage of total assets were less than 1% at September 30, 2022.
Loans Receivable
The loan portfolio represents our most significant source of interest income. Our lending strategy is focused on small- and medium-sized businesses and professionals that seek highly personalized banking services. The loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, construction loans, residential mortgages, home improvement loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, overdraft lines of credit, and others.
Net loans increased $547.2 million, or 22%, to $3.04 billion at September 30, 2022, versus $2.49 billion at December 31, 2021. Loans originated through the PPP loan program continue to be repaid or forgiven by the SBA, which offsets the growth experienced in other categories in the portfolio. Excluding the impact of the PPP loans, gross loans increased by $657.9 million, or 27%, to $3.05 billion at September 30, 2022 compared to $2.39 billion at December 31, 2021. This growth was primarily the result of the successful execution of our relationship banking model which has driven a steady flow in quality loan demand particularly within the residential mortgages and commercial real estate categories.
Investment Securities
Investment securities available for sale are investments that may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions, and for liquidity and other purposes. Our debt securities consist primarily of U.S. Government agency SBA bonds, U.S. Government agency collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”), agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), municipal securities, and corporate bonds. Investment securities available for sale totaled $999.5 million at September 30, 2022 as compared to $1.08 billion at December 31, 2021. The $75.8 million decrease was primarily due to a net unrealized loss of $191.9 million on available for sale securities, paydowns, maturities, and calls of securities available for sale totaling $100.0 million and proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale totaling $34.1 million, partially offset by the purchase of securities available for sale totaling $251.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2022, the portfolio had a net unrealized loss on available for sale securities of $203.5 million compared to a net unrealized loss of $11.6 million at December 31, 2021. The $191.9 million decrease in the market value of the investment portfolio was driven by an increase in market interest rates, which drove a decrease in the value of the available for sale securities held in our portfolio at September 30, 2022. As interest rates are expected to continue to increase throughout 2022, management will be looking to mitigate the trend on our investment portfolio with offsetting strategies and opportunities.
56
Investment securities held-to-maturity are investments for which there is the intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity. These investments are carried at amortized cost. The held-to-maturity portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Government agency Small Business Investment Company bonds (“SBIC”) and SBA bonds, CMO’s and MBS’s. The amortized cost of securities held-to-maturity totaled $1.56 billion and $1.66 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, with the decrease primarily attributable to securities paydowns in the held-to maturity category. The fair value of securities held-to-maturity totaled $1.27 billion and $1.65 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The $379.8 million decrease was primarily due to a net unrecognized loss of $281.8 million on held to maturity securities and paydowns, maturities, and calls of securities held to maturity totaling $147.4 million, partially offset by the purchase of securities held to maturity totaling $51.1 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2022, the portfolio had a net unrecognized loss on held-to-maturity securities of $294.8 million compared to a net unrecognized loss of $12.9 million at December 31, 2021. The $281.8 million decrease in the market value of the investment portfolio was driven by an increase in market interest rates, which drove a decrease in the value of the held-to-maturity securities held in our portfolio at September 30, 2022.
Equity securities consist of investments in the preferred stock of domestic banks. Equity securities are held at fair value. The fair value of equity securities totaled $6.6 million at September 30, 2022 compared to $9.2 million at December 31, 2021.
Restricted Stock
Restricted stock, which represents a required investment in the capital stock of correspondent banks related to available credit facilities, was carried at cost as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. As of those dates, restricted stock consisted of investments in the capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (“FHLB”) and Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (“ACBB”).
At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the investment in FHLB of Pittsburgh capital stock totaled $21.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively. At both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2020, ACBB capital stock totaled $143,000. Both the FHLB and ACBB paid dividends during the third quarter of 2022.
Premises and Equipment
The balance of premises and equipment increased by $3.5 million to $130.9 million at September 30, 2022 from $127.4 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to purchases of premises and equipment totaling $9.9 million partially offset by depreciation and amortization expense of $6.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The total branch count was 34 at September 30, 2022 with the opening of two new branches in Ocean City, NJ and Wayne, PA compared to 32 at December 31, 2021.
Other Real Estate Owned
At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the balance of other real estate owned was $876,000 and $360,000, respectively.
Operating Leases
–
Right of Use Asset
Under ASC 842, the right-of-use asset is valued as the initial amount of the lease liability obligation adjusted for any initial direct costs, prepaid or accrued rent, and any lease incentives. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the balance of operating leases – right-of-use asset was $73.1 million and $75.6 million, respectively.
Deposits
Deposits, which include non-interest and interest-bearing demand deposits, money market, savings, and time deposits, are Republic’s major source of funding. Deposits are generally solicited from our market area through the offering of a variety of products to attract and retain customers, with a primary focus on multi-product relationships.
57
Total deposits increased by $60.4 million to $5.25 billion at September 30, 2022 from $5.19 billion at December 31, 2021 with the increase primarily driven in the interest-bearing demand account category. We focus our efforts on the growth of deposit balances through the successful execution of our relationship banking model which is based upon a high level of customer service and satisfaction. This strategy has also allowed us to build a stable core-deposit base and nearly eliminate our dependence upon the more volatile sources of funding found in brokered and internet certificates of deposit. Our participation in the PPP loan program also resulted in significant growth in new deposit relationships.
Other Borrowings
At September 30, 2022, we had $442.5 million in other borrowings compared to no borrowings at December 31, 2021 as borrowings were used to fund loan growth.
Operating Lease Liability Obligation
Under ASC 842, the operating lease liability obligation is calculated as the present value of the lease payments, using the discount rate specified in the lease, or if that is not available, our incremental borrowing rate. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the balance of the operating lease liability obligation was $79.6 million and $81.8 million, respectively.
Shareholders ’
Equity
Total shareholders’ equity decreased $134.7 million to $189.5 million at September 30, 2022 compared to $324.2 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss of $142.8 million partially offset by an increase in retained earnings of $6.0 million. The decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss due to an increase in market interest rates which drove a decrease in the market value of the securities held in our portfolio.
Results of Operations
Three Months Ended September 30, 2022
Compared to Three Months Ended September
30, 2021
We reported net income available to common shareholders of $909,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2022, compared to net income of $5.2 million or $0.08 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily driven by an increase in non-interest expenses and a decrease in non-interest income partially offset by an increase in net interest income.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021
We reported net income available to common shareholders of $9.6 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to net income of $16.5 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in earnings year over year was primarily driven by an increase in non-interest expenses and a decrease in non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily related to an increase in legal expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Legal expenses increased by $10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 when compared to the same period last year due to attorney fees paid related to litigation as described in Note 4,
Commitments and Contingencies
and other shareholder-related issues .
The decrease in non-interest income was primarily driven by a decrease in mortgage banking income due to a reduction in the volume of mortgage originations during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by an increase in interest and dividends on investment securities.

Analysis of Net Interest Income
Our earnings depend primarily upon Republic’s net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by changes in the mix of the volume and rates of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table provides an analysis of net interest income on an annualized basis, setting forth for the periods average assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity, interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, average yields earned on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities, and Republic’s net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets). Averages are computed based on daily balances. Non-accrual loans are included in average loans receivable. Yields are adjusted for tax equivalency, using a rate of 24% in 2022 and 24% in 2021.

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Net interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased $6.7 million, or 21%, over the same period in 2021. Interest income on interest-earning assets totaled $46.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $10.4 million, compared to $35.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in interest income was primarily the result of an $854.1 million increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets and a 29-basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The most significant increase in interest-earning assets was a $889.4 million increase in the average balance of the investment securities portfolio. Total interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased by $3.7 million, or 85%, over the same period in 2021. Interest expense on deposits increased by $1.5 million, or 35%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 versus the same period in 2021 due primarily to a $492.4 million increase in the average balance of deposits and an 8-basis point increase in the average cost of deposit balances. Interest expense on other borrowings increased by $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to September 30, 2021 due primarily to an increase in the average balance of overnight borrowings.
Net interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $19.3 million, or 21%, over the same period in 2021. Interest income on interest-earning assets totaled $128.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $20.4 million, compared to $108.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in interest income earned was primarily the result of a $991.5 million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets, offset by a 7-point decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The most significant increase in interest-earning assets was a $1.16 billion increase in the average balance of the investment portfolio. Total interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased by $1.1 million, or 8%, for the same period in 2021. Interest expense on deposits decreased by $1.3 million, or 9%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 versus the same period in 2021 due primarily to a 10-basis point decrease in the average cost of deposit balances. Interest expense on other borrowings increased by $2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to September 30, 2021 due primarily to an increase in the average balance of overnight borrowings balances.
61
Changes in net interest income are frequently measured by two statistics: net interest rate spread and net interest margin. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest rate spread on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 2.42% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 2.39% for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and was 2.55% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. Net interest margin represents the difference between interest income, including net loan fees earned, and interest expense, reflected as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the fully tax-equivalent net interest margin was 2.63% and 2.54%, respectively. The increase in the net interest margin during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to the yield on interest-earning assets rising at a faster rate than the cost of funds on interest-earning liabilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the fully tax-equivalent net interest margin was 2.69% and 2.71%, respectively. The decrease in the net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to the cost of funds on interest-earning liabilities rising at a faster rate than the yield on interest-earning assets.
Provision for Credit Losses
We recorded a provision of $4.0 million for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to a $900,000 provision for the three months ended September 30, 2021. We recorded a $4.8 million provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $3.9 million provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The provision recorded is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for credit losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb life of loan losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded commitments. The increase in the provision for credit losses for the three- and nine-month periods was primarily driven by requirements related to the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on loan balances and unfunded commitments due to the adoption of
ASU 2016-13
during 2022.
Non ‑ Interest Income
Total non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2022 decreased by $1.6 million, or 22%, compared to the same period in 2021. Mortgage banking income totaled $844,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2022, which represents a decrease of $1.6 million compared to the same period in 2021 due to a decrease in residential mortgage loan originations due to the higher interest rate environment. Loan and servicing fees totaled $311,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022, which represents a decrease of $635,000 from the same period in 2021. Gains on the sales of SBA loans decreased $139,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 to $502,000 when compared to same period in 2021. Service fees on deposit accounts increased $385,000 to $3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021.
Total non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 decreased $10.3 million, or 41%, compared to the same period in 2021. Mortgage banking income totaled $2.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, which represents a decrease of $7.0 million compared to the same period in 2021 due to an decrease in residential mortgage loan originations year over year. Loan and servicing fees totaled $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, which represents a decrease of $739,000 from the same period in 2021. Gains on the sales of SBA loans decreased $322,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $1.7 million when compared to same period in 2021. Service fees on deposit accounts totaled $10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, which represents a decrease of $260,000 over the same period in 2021.

Non ‑ Interest Expenses
Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2021
Non-interest expenses increased $7.9 million, or 27%, to $37.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. An explanation of changes in non-interest expenses for certain categories is presented in the following paragraphs.
Salaries and employee benefits increased by $1.6 million, or 11%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily as a result of merit increases and increased staffing levels.

Occupancy expense, including depreciation and amortization expenses, increased by $486,000, or 9%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period last year primarily as a result of new branches being opened in 2022.
Other real estate owned expenses totaled $317,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $198,000, or 166%, compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily related to higher costs to carry foreclosed properties during the current period.
All other non-interest expenses increased by $5.6 million, or 60%, for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period last year due primarily to increases in expenses related to legal expenses and professional fees.

New branches were opened in Ocean City, NJ and Wayne, PA during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 bringing the total branch count to 34.
Occupancy expense, including depreciation and amortization expenses, increased by $231,000, or 1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period last year, primarily as a result of new branches being opened in 2022.
Other real estate expenses totaled $409,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, a decrease of $301,000, or 42%, compared to the same period in 2021. The decrease was primarily related to higher costs to carry foreclosed properties during the prior quarterly period.
All other non-interest expenses increased by $14.6 million, or 54%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period last year primarily due to the increase in legal expenses related to the lawsuits during the period as disclosed in Note 4, Commitment and Contingencies and other shareholder-related issues.
63
Another productivity measure utilized by management is the efficiency ratio. This ratio expresses the relationship of non-interest expenses to net interest income plus non-interest income. The efficiency ratio equaled 86.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to 76.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The efficiency ratio equaled 84.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to 75.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 versus September 30, 2021 was due to non-interest expenses increasing at a faster rate than net interest income and non-interest income.
Provision for Federal Income Taxes
We recorded a provision for income taxes of $476,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to a $2.0 million provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2021. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $3.8 million, compared to a provision for income taxes of $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were 24% and 25%, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the effective tax rates were 24% and 24%, respectively.
The net deferred tax asset balance was $63.6 million as of September 30, 2022 and $14.2 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase in the deferred tax asset balance was primarily related to FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 320 (ASC 320)  Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
and the unrealized losses in the investment portfolio. The deferred tax asset will continue to be analyzed on a quarterly basis for changes affecting realizability.
The Company evaluates the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently, if necessary, in accordance with the guidance provided in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), in particular, applying the criteria set forth therein to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management’s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company carefully weighed both positive and negative evidence currently available. Judgment is required when considering the relative impact of such evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.
Preferred Dividends
Dividends of $644,000 and $2.2 million were declared and paid on the Company’s outstanding preferred stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $875,000 and $2.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.
64
Net Income and Net Income per Common Share
Net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $909,000, a decrease of $4.3 million, compared to a net income available to common shareholders of $5.2 million recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2021. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, basic and fully diluted net income per common share was $0.01 and $0.01, respectively, compared to basic and fully diluted net income per common share of $0.09 and $0.08 for the same period in 2021.
Net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $9.6 million, a decrease of $6.8 million, compared to a net income available to common shareholders of $16.5 million recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, basic and fully diluted net income per common share was $0.15 and $0.14, respectively, compared to basic and fully diluted net income per common share of $0.28 and $0.25 for the same period in 2021.
Return on Average Assets and Average Equity
Return on average assets (“ROA”) measures our net income in relation to our total average assets. The ROA for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was 0.10%, compared to 0.47% for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The ROA for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was 0.27% and 0.52%, respectively. Return on average equity (“ROE”) indicates how effectively we can generate net income on the capital invested by our shareholders. ROE is calculated by dividing annualized net income by average stockholders' equity. The ROE was 2.71% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to 7.47% for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The ROE for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was 6.03% and 8.07%, respectively.
Commitments, Contingencies and Concentrations
Financial instruments with contract amounts representing potential credit risk were commitments to extend credit of approximately $597.4 million and $549.8 million, and standby letters of credit of approximately $20.1 million and $18.0 million, at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. These financial instruments constitute off-balance sheet arrangements. Commitments often expire without being drawn upon. Substantially all of the $597.4 million of commitments to extend credit at September 30, 2022 were committed as variable rate credit facilities.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, and many require the payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment, and accounts receivable.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk and collateral policy involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment, and accounts receivable.
The exposure to credit loss for the Company in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for loan commitments and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same allowance for credit loss policies for evaluating expected losses associated with commitments and standby letters of credit as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.
65
Regulatory Matters
We are required to comply with certain “risk-based” capital adequacy guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The risk-based capital guidelines assign varying risk weights to the individual assets held by a bank. The guidelines also assign weights to the “credit-equivalent” amounts of certain off-balance sheet items, such as letters of credit and interest rate and currency swap contracts.
Under the capital rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned to one of several categories of risk-weights, based primarily on relative risk. Under applicable capital rules, Republic is required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 6%, a minimum total capital requirement of 8% and a minimum leverage ratio requirement of 4%. Under the rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets.
Management believes that the Company and Republic met, as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, all applicable capital adequacy requirements. The FDIC categorized Republic as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. There are no calculations or events since that notification which management believes would have changed this categorization. However, because Republic’s capital conservation buffer fell below the required buffer amount of 2.5% as of September 30, 2022, Republic is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses. Republic is limited to paying no more than 60% of Republic’s “eligible retained income” on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses. Eligible retained income is the greater of : (1) Republic’s net income, calculated in accordance with the instructions to the Call Report, for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income; and (2) the average of Republic’s net income, calculated in accordance with the instructions to the Call Report, for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter.
The Company and Republic’s ability to maintain the required levels of capital is substantially dependent upon the success of their capital and business plans, the impact of future economic events on Republic’s loan customers and Republic’s ability to manage its interest rate risk, growth and other operating expenses.

Dividend Policy
On August 26, 2020, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of 7.00% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), at a price of $25.00 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $48.3 million from the offering, after deducting offering costs. The Company will pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock when and if declared by its Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof. If declared, dividends will be due and payable at a rate of 7.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year. During the three month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022, dividends of $644,000 and $2.2 million were declared and paid on preferred stock compared to $875,000 and $2.6 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021.
Pursuant to the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares will not be declared, paid or set aside for payment to the extent such act would cause the Company to fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable capital adequacy guidelines.
We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We have no current plans to pay cash dividends on common stock in 2022.  Our ability to pay dividends will depend primarily on the receipt of dividends from our subsidiary, Republic. Dividend payments from Republic are subject to legal and regulatory limitations. The ability of Republic to pay dividends is also subject to profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures, and other cash flow requirements. As further discussed above under “Regulatory Matters,” because Republic’s capital conservation buffer fell below the required buffer amount of 2.5%, Republic was subject to limitations on paying dividends as of September 30, 2022. Republic is limited to paying no more than 60% of Republic’s “eligible retained income” on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses.
67
Liquidity
A financial institution must maintain and manage liquidity to ensure it has the ability to meet its financial obligations. These obligations include: the payment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity; the repayment of borrowings as they mature; the payment of lease obligations as they become due; the ability to fund new and existing loans and other funding commitments; and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities. Liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities. Our most liquid assets consist of cash, amounts due from banks and federal funds sold and available for sale securities.
Regulatory authorities require us to maintain certain liquidity ratios in order for funds to be available to satisfy commitments to borrowers and the demands of depositors. In response to these requirements, we have formed an asset/liability committee (“ALCO”), comprised of certain members of Republic’s Board of Directors and senior management to monitor such ratios. The ALCO is responsible for managing the liquidity position and interest sensitivity. That committee’s primary objective is to maximize net interest income while configuring Republic’s interest-sensitive assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk and provide adequate liquidity for projected needs. The ALCO meets on a quarterly basis or more frequently if deemed necessary.
Our target and actual liquidity levels are determined by comparisons of the estimated repayment and marketability of interest-earning assets with projected future outflows of deposits and other liabilities. Our most liquid assets, comprised of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, totaled $52.5 million at September 30, 2022, compared to $118.9 million at December 31, 2021. Loan maturities and repayments are another source of asset liquidity. At September 30, 2022, Republic estimated that more than $170.0 million of loans would mature or repay in the six-month period ending March 31, 2023. Additionally, a significant portion of our investment securities are available to satisfy liquidity requirements through sales on the open market or by pledging as collateral to access credit facilities. At September 30, 2022, we had outstanding commitments (including unused lines of credit and letters of credit) of $597.4 million. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year totaled $93.4 million at September 30, 2022. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet all current commitments.
Daily funding requirements have historically been satisfied by generating core deposits and certificates of deposit with competitive rates, buying federal funds, or utilizing the credit facilities of the FHLB. We have established a line of credit with the FHLB of Pittsburgh. Our maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $1.5 billion at September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding term borrowings with the FHLB. At September 30, 2022, we had outstanding overnight borrowings totaling $442.5 million. We had no outstanding overnight borrowings at December 31, 2021. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the FHLB had issued letters of credit, on Republic’s behalf, totaling $100.0 million against our available credit line. Subsequent to September 30, 2022 and through the date of this report, outstanding overnight borrowings have increased by approximately $323.2 million.  The letters of credit remain undrawn through the date of this report. We also established a Fed Funds line of credit with Zions Bank of $15.0 million to assist in managing our liquidity position. We had no amounts outstanding against the Zions Fed Funds line at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
Interest Rate Risk
Net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Company. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Company's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Company actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.
68
Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates
In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Company's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The Company primarily monitors the percentage change on the base-case economic value of equity. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 100 basis point shock with a floor of zero percent.
The table below, as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above.

Credit Quality
Republic’s written lending policies require specific underwriting, loan documentation and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding, with independent credit department approval for the majority of new loan balances. A committee consisting of senior management and certain members of the Board of Directors oversees the loan approval process to monitor that proper standards are maintained, while approving the majority of commercial loans.
Loans are generally classified as non-accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of interest or principal for a period of more than 90 days, unless such loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as non-accrual if repayment of principal and/or interest in full is in doubt. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower, in accordance with the contractual terms.
While a loan is classified as non-accrual, any collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding. When the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. For non-accrual loans, which have been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. Cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for credit losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered.

Allowance for Credit Losses
On January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13
(Topic 326),
which replaced the incurred loss methodology with CECL for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and other commitments to extend credit. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance for management’s estimate of expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The process to determine expected credit losses utilizes analytic tools and management judgment and is reviewed on a quarterly basis. When management is reasonably certain that a loan balance is not fully collectable, an analysis is completed whereby a specific reserve may be established or a full or partial charge off is recorded against the allowance. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance via a quantitative analysis that considers available information from internal and external sources related to past loan loss and prepayment experience and current conditions as well as the incorporation of reasonable and supportable forecasts. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. Also included in the allowance for credit losses are qualitative reserves that are expected, but, in the management’s assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative analysis. The allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off.
Management evaluates a variety of factors including available published economic information in arriving at its forecast. Factors considered in the calculation of the allowance for credit losses include several qualitative and quantitative factors such as historical loss experience, trends in delinquency and nonperforming loan balances, changes in risk composition and underwriting standards, experience and ability of management, and general economic conditions as well as external factors, such as competition, legal and regulatory requirements. Historical loss experience is analyzed by reviewing charge-offs over a life of loan period to determine loss rates consistent with the loan categories depicted in the allowance for credit loss table below.
The factors supporting the allowance for credit losses do not diminish the fact that the entire allowance for credit losses is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio and related commitment portfolio. Our principal focus, therefore, is on the adequacy of the total allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is subject to review by banking regulators along with the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. Our primary bank regulators regularly conduct examinations of the allowance for credit losses and make assessments regarding the adequacy and the methodology employed in their determination.

Provision to rollforward the allowance for credit losses excludes a provision of $7,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 related to off-balance sheet commitments.

Includes non-accruing loans.
We recorded a provision for credit losses of $4.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2022 and a $4.8 million provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The portion of the provision for credit losses related to unfunded commitments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $98,000 and $8,000. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $900,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2021 and a $3.9 million provision was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The provision recorded is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for credit losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb expected losses in the loan portfolio.
The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-performing loans (coverage ratio) was 141.7% at September 30, 2022, compared to 147.4% at December 31, 2021 and 133.0% at September 30, 2021. Total non-performing loans were $15.5 million, $12.9 million, and $11.9 million at September 30, 2022, December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The increase in the coverage ratio at September 30, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 was a result of an increase in the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2022.
72
Management makes at least a quarterly determination as to an appropriate provision to maintain an allowance for credit losses that it determines is adequate to absorb life of loan credit losses in the loan portfolio. The Board of Directors periodically reviews the status of all non-accrual and impaired loans and loans classified by the management team. The Board of Directors also considers specific loans, pools of similar loans, historical charge-off activity, economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecast of future credit losses, and other relevant factors in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Any additions deemed necessary to the allowance for credit losses are charged to operating expenses.
We evaluate loans for payment delinquency and potential charge-offs on a quarterly basis. Any loan rated as substandard or lower will have a collateral evaluation analysis completed in accordance with Company policy to determine if any further adjustments need to be made to the allowance for expected credit losses. Our credit monitoring process assesses the ultimate collectability of an outstanding loan balance from all potential sources. When a loan is expected to be uncollectible it is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. Unsecured commercial loans and all consumer loans are charged-off upon reaching the 90-day delinquency mark unless they are well-secured and in the process of collection. The timing on charge-offs of all other loan types is subjective and will be recognized when management determines that full repayment, either from the cash flow of the borrower, collateral sources, and/or guarantors, will not be sufficient and that repayment is unlikely. A full or partial charge-off is recognized equal to the amount of the estimated deficiency calculation.
Serious delinquency is often the first indicator of a potential charge-off. Reductions in appraised collateral values and deteriorating financial condition of borrowers and guarantors are factors considered when evaluating potential charge-offs. The likelihood of possible recoveries or improvements in a borrower’s financial condition is also assessed when considering a charge-off.
Partial charge-offs of non-performing and collateral dependent loans can significantly reduce the coverage ratio and other credit loss statistics due to the fact that the balance of the allowance for credit losses will be reduced while still carrying the remainder of a non-performing loan balance. The amount of non-performing loans for which partial charge-offs have been recorded amounted to $441,000 at September 30, 2022 and $4.2 million at December 31, 2021.

Our charge-off policy is reviewed on an annual basis and updated as necessary. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2022, there were no changes made to this policy.
Effects of Inflation
The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. Therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. Management believes that the most significant impact of inflation on its financial results is through our need and ability to react to changes in interest rates. Management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over a one-year time horizon in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations.
73
ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT MARKET RISK
There has been no material change in the Company’s assessment of its sensitivity to market risk since its presentation in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on October 26, 2022.
ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The Company’s management, with the participation of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e), were not effective due to the identification of the following previously disclosed material weaknesses and additional material weaknesses relating to effective controls over the measurement of Allowance for Credit Losses:
●
A failure to maintain an effective control environment, which resulted in deficiencies in the communication of certain relevant information to the Board of Directors of the Company, including information related to branch expenditures and the material weaknesses identified below.
●
A failure to design and maintain effective controls over the review, analysis and approval of related party transactions.
●
A failure to maintain effective controls over the implementation of FASB’s accounting standard, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, specifically, with regard to the quantification and review of the transition adjustment from the incurred loss model to the Current Expected Loss Model (“CECL”).
●
A failure to maintain effective controls over the measurement of Allowance for Credit Losses in accordance with FASB’s accounting standard, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, specifically the material weaknesses relate to a failure: (1) to identify and asses the risk introduced by ASC 326 impacting the system of internal control; (2) over the design and operation of the controls over the data, assumptions and methods utilized in the development of the Allowance for Credit Losses; (3) over the relevant expertise to assess the model; and (4) to maintain appropriate oversight and governance over the Allowance for Credit Losses. These material weaknesses resulted in a misstatement of the Company’s financial statements. Refer to Note 2 to these financial statements for further details on this.
These material weaknesses could result in misstatements of the aforementioned accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
74
Remediation Efforts of Material Weaknesses
Management and the Board of Directors have been actively engaged in taking action to remediate the material weaknesses noted above. Such changes, all of which were made subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2022, include:
●
the implementation of an ACL Governance Committee, which include the Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Credit Officer and the review of CECL results by the ACL Governance Committee and Audit Committee, including the key assumptions, inputs, and model results;
●
the implementation of additional oversight by the Audit Committee over the CECL results;
●
a quarterly review of key model assumptions utilized in the CECL analysis, documented in writing, including considerations of any changes to the assumptions or methodology;
●
the implementation of a checklist for review of model output including confirmation and documentation of each checklist item performed;
●
the implementation of CECL model input and output reconciliations;
●
the implementation of additional processes around the identification of loan segments;
●
the implementation of additional governance review over the day 1 adoption of the new accounting standard;
●
the enhancement of supporting documentation over initial key model assumptions and input selections; and
●
changes in and additional training of personnel who perform processes relating to the measurement of CECL.
The material weaknesses will not be considered fully remediated until the enhanced controls are fully implemented and operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.
The following changes in response to the previously disclosed material weaknesses were made prior to the quarter ended September 30, 2022:
●
the appointment of Harry D. Madonna as Executive Chair of the Board and Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company;
●
the re-appointment of a Lead Independent Director of the Company;
●
the restructuring of the Board of Directors to strengthen its risk and financial reporting oversight functions, including the addition of one new independent director with extensive public company and financial reporting experience;
●
reconstitution of the membership of the committees of the Board of Directors and the appointment of new committee chairs;
●
more frequent meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees;
●
the active encouragement by management, with the assistance of the Chairman and the rest of the Board, of an open and collaborative culture, to set an appropriate “tone at the top”;
●
the enhancement of information to be provided by management to the Board of Directors, specifically with regard to any potential branch expansion opportunities and anticipated expenses associated therewith;
●
the enhancement of the Company’s policies and procedures for the identification, review and reporting of existing related party transactions and the discontinuation of many future transactions with related parties; and
●
the implementation of design controls related to CECL and the Allowance for Credit Losses, which includes hiring an external consultant to assist with the continued refinement and testing of design features and controls.
The material weaknesses will not be considered fully remediated until the enhanced controls are fully implemented and operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.
Changes in Internal Controls
The principal executive officer and principal financial officer also conducted an evaluation of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (“Internal Control”) to determine whether any changes in Internal Control occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected or that are reasonably likely to materially affect Internal Control. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such change during the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Management and the Board of Directors continue to be actively engaged in taking action to remediate the material weaknesses noted above.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
Control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not an absolute, level of assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company and Republic are from time to time parties (plaintiff or defendant) to lawsuits in the normal course of business. While any litigation involves an element of uncertainty, management is of the opinion that the liability of the Company and Republic, if any, resulting from such actions will not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company and Republic, except as noted below.

On September 19, 2022, a complaint was filed in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania against the Company and its current Interim Chief Executive Officer and director and two other current directors.  The lawsuit is styled  Vernon Hill et al. v. Lisa Jacobs, et al.,  Case No. 220901684. The complaint was amended on December 12, 2022. The two plaintiffs, the former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and a former director of the Company, allege defamation, defamation per se and false light against the three individual defendants. The amended complaint includes three additional allegations by the former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, alleging fraudulent inducement (against Madonna and Wildstein), fraudulent concealment (against Madonna, Jacobs and Wildstein), and unjust enrichment (against the Company). The former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer also alleges a breach of his employment agreement by the Company. The complaint seeks certain reimbursement payments and compensatory and (as against the individual defendants) punitive damages.  The defendants all filed Preliminary Objections to the complaint, as well as to the amended complaint, and discovery has commenced. On February 27, 2023, Plaintiffs filed papers opposing the Preliminary Objections, and briefing of those Objections is ongoing.  The matter is in its early stages and, accordingly, the Company is still assessing the potential outcomes and materiality of the matter.  The Company plans to defend itself vigorously.
On November 22, 2022, shareholders George E. Norcross, III, Gregory B. Braca and Philip A. Norcross filed a complaint in the same Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas against the Company and its directors.  The lawsuit, captioned  George E. Norcross, III, et al. v. Republic First Bancorp, Inc.  Case No. 221102195, alleges generally that the Company and its Board have acted in violation of their fiduciary duties by rejecting Plaintiffs’ efforts to nominate Mr. Braca as a director candidate at its 2022 annual meeting of shareholders.  The Company rejected that attempted nomination on grounds that the plaintiff who made the nomination was not a stockholder of record, as the Company’s By-Laws require.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief that includes a demand that the Court waive enforcement of the Company’s By-Laws, reopen the deadline for nominating director candidates or find that the defendants violated the Company’s By-Laws in connection with its appointment of director Benjamin Duster to fill a vacancy on the Board. On December 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction and asked defendants to accept service of the complaint, which they have done.  Following a status conference on January 18, 2023, a hearing on the preliminary injunction motion was scheduled for April 25, 2023, and the Company was ordered not to hold any shareholder vote with regard to any vacancy on its board of directors until May 31, 2023, at the earliest. Given its early stage, the Company cannot predict potential outcomes of the matter or plaintiffs’ motion; however, the defendants deny the alleged wrongdoing and intend to defend the matter vigorously.
On November 28, 2022, Plaintiffs Vernon Hill (“Hill”) and Interarch, Inc. (“Interarch”) filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, captioned  Hill and Interarch v. Republic First Bancorp, Inc. et al. , No. 2:22-cv-04735, and they filed an amended complaint on February 10, 2023. Hill is a former Republic First Bancorp, Inc. (“Republic”) board chair and Chief Executive Officer and a former Republic director.  Interarch, owned by Hill’s wife, Shirley Hill, provided certain branding and architecture services to Republic.  Plaintiffs Hill and Interarch bring claims against Defendants Republic and two Republic employees (who are former Interarch employees), Rodney Dean (“Dean”) and John Chessa (“Chessa”).  Plaintiff Interarch brings claims for copyright infringement (against Republic), breach of contract (against Republic), and breach of the duty of loyalty (against Dean and Chessa).  Hill, in turn, brings a claim for trademark infringement (against Republic) and violation of Hill’s right of publicity (against Republic). Hill and Interarch together bring claims for unjust enrichment (against Republic), unfair competition (against Republic), misappropriation of trade secrets under federal and state law (against all Defendants), misappropriation of trade secrets under federal and state law (against all Defendants), misappropriation of confidential information under state law (against all Defendants), tortious interference (against Republic) and a request for a declaratory judgment relating to these claims (against all Defendants).  This matter is in its early stages, and Republic is assessing the potential outcome and materiality of this matter.  The Company intends to defend itself vigorously.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Significant risk factors could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operation. Risk factors discussing these risks can be found below and in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. You should carefully consider these risk factors. The risks described in the Company’s Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
The Company continually encounters technological change.
The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, including the entrance of financial technology companies offering new financial service products. The Company regularly upgrades or replaces technological systems to increase efficiency, enhance product and service capabilities, eliminate risks of end-of-lifecycle products, reduce costs, and better serve our customers. In June 2022, the Company replaced its core customer and deposit systems and other ancillary systems (collectively referred to as "core system"). While the conversion was completed successfully, the Company may face operational risks after the conversion, including disruptions to its technology systems, which may adversely impact customers. The Company's future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company's operations. Many of the Company's competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may encounter significant problems in effectively implementing new technology-driven products and services and may not be successful in marketing the new products and services to its customers. These problems might include significant time delays, cost overruns, loss of key people, and technological system failures. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry or failure to successfully complete the replacement of technological systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.
76
Continued delays in the filing of our periodic reports with the SEC and our failure to hold an annual meeting no later than one year after the end of the Company ’ s fiscal year-end could impact our listing on Nasdaq, which would materially and adversely affect our stock price, financial condition and/or results of operations.
Due to the Company needing additional time to assess the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company’s internal controls and evaluate the appropriateness of the methodology and assumptions contained in, the model established by the Company’s prior management in connection with the required adoption of FASB’s
Topic 326
–
Current Expected Credit Losses ( “ CECL ” )
accounting standard, effective January 1, 2022, we were unable to file this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q on a timely basis.  We were also previously unable to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 on a timely basis.  Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. If we are not able to timely file our required periodic financial reports with the SEC, our common stock may be subject to delisting by Nasdaq.
Additionally, the Company is not in compliance with Listing Rule 5620(a), which requires the Company to hold an annual meeting of shareholders no later than one year after the end of the Company’s fiscal year-end for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market. On January 19, 2023, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel granted the Company’s request for an extension through June 30, 2023 to hold its 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. If the Company is unable to comply with Listing Rule 5620(a) by June 30, 2023, our common stock may be subject to delisting by Nasdaq.
If our common stock is delisted by Nasdaq, it would materially and adversely affect our stock price, financial condition and/or results of operations.
A lack of liquidity could adversely affect the Company ’ s financial condition and results of operations.
Liquidity is essential to the Company’s business. The Company relies on its ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of loans to ensure that there is adequate liquidity to fund its operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale and maturities of loans and securities and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on liquidity. The Company’s most important source of funds is deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff, which are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates, local and national economic conditions and the availability and attractiveness of alternative investments. Further, the demand for deposits may be reduced due to a variety of factors such as demographic patterns, changes in customer preferences, reductions in consumers’ disposable income, the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve or regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments such as money market funds, the Company would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, which would increase its funding costs and reduce net interest income. Any changes made to the rates offered on deposits to remain competitive with other financial institutions may also adversely affect profitability and liquidity.
Other primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the FHLB of Pittsburgh.  The Company also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. The Company’s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize its activities, or on terms that are acceptable, could be impaired by factors that affect the Company directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry, a decrease in the level of the Company’s business activity as a result of a downturn in markets or by one or more adverse regulatory actions against the Company.
Any decline in available funding could adversely impact the Company’s ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet expenses, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on its liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to stringent capital requirements which may adversely impact return on equity, require additional capital raises, or limit the ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares.
Federal regulations establish minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions, including minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, and define "capital" for calculating these ratios. The minimum capital requirements are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The regulations also establish a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.5%, which if complied will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the capital conservation buffer amount. As of September 30, 2022, the Company fell below the capital conservation buffer amount for its total capital ratio calculation. As such, the Company is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonus.  For further information, see “Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Regulatory Matters.” The application of these capital requirements could, among other things, require us to maintain higher capital resulting in lower returns on equity, and we may be required to obtain additional capital to comply or result in regulatory actions if we are unable to comply with such requirements.
Our 100 largest deposit clients account for 16% of our total deposits and, therefore, if we were unable to maintain their deposits, we would be forced to replace such funds, which may prove difficult or costly.
As of September 30, 2022, our 100 largest bank depositors accounted for, in the aggregate, 16% of our total deposits. The majority of these deposits are not insured by the FDIC and could present a heightened risk of withdrawal, if such depositors materially decreased the volume of those deposits, it could reduce our liquidity.  As a result, it could become necessary for us to replace those deposits with higher-cost deposits or FHLB borrowings, which would adversely affect our net interest income and, therefore, our results of operations.
