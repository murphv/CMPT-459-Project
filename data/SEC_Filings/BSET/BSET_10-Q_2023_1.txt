BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-UNAUDITED
FEBRUARY 25, 2023
(Dollars in thousands except share and per share data)
1. Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements. In our opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.
References to “ASC” included hereinafter refer to the Accounting Standards Codification established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) as the source of authoritative GAAP.
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bassett Furniture Industries, Incorporated (“Bassett”, “we”, “our”, or the “Company”) and our wholly-owned subsidiaries of which we have a controlling interest. In accordance with ASC Topic 810, we have evaluated our licensees and certain other entities to determine whether they are variable interest entities (“VIEs”) of which we are the primary beneficiary and thus would require consolidation in our financial statements. To date we have concluded that none of our licensees represent VIEs.
Revenue from the sale of furniture and accessories is reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income net of estimates for returns and allowances.
On January 31, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Zenith Freight Lines, LLC (“Zenith”) to J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (“J.B. Hunt”). The sale was completed on February 28, 2022. Accordingly, the operations of our logistical services segment for the three months ended February 26, 2022 are presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income as discontinued operations. See Note 12, Discontinued Operations, for additional information. Costs incurred by Bassett for logistical services performed for Bassett by Zenith were included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended February 26, 2022.
On September 2, 2022, we acquired
100 % of the capital stock of Noa Home Inc. (“Noa Home”), a mid-priced e-commerce furniture retailer headquartered in Montreal, Canada. Noa Home has operations in Canada, Australia, Singapore and the United Kingdom. Since acquisition, Noa Home has been consolidated as a wholly-owned subsidiary. See Note 3 for additional information.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation (see Note 13, Segments).
2. Interim Financial Presentation and Other Information
All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The results of operations for the three months ended February 25, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 26, 2022.
Income Taxes
We calculate an anticipated effective tax rate for the year based on our annual estimates of pretax income and use that effective tax rate to record our year-to-date income tax provision. Any change in annual projections of pretax income could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate for the respective quarter.
Our effective tax rate was
36.8 % and
26.3 % for the three months ended February 25, 2023 and February 26, 2022, respectively. These effective rates differ from the federal statutory rate of
21 % primarily due to increases in the valuation allowance placed on deferred tax assets associated with Noa Home, the effects of state income taxes and various permanent differences.
Non-cash Investing and Financing Activity
During the three months ended February 25, 2023 and February 26, 2022, $ 3,406
and $ 4119 , respectively, of lease right-of- use assets were added through the recognition of the corresponding lease obligations.

3. Business Combinations
On September 2, 2022, we acquired
100 % of the capital stock of Noa Home Inc. (“Noa Home”), a mid-priced e-commerce furniture retailer headquartered in Montreal, Canada. Noa Home has operations in Canada, Australia, Singapore and the United Kingdom. The initial purchase price (denominated in Canadian dollars) of approximately C$ 7,700
included cash payments of C$ 2,000
paid to the co-founders of Noa Home and approximately C$ 5,700
for the repayment of existing debt owed by Noa Home. The Noa Home co-founders will also have the opportunity to receive additional cash payments totaling approximately C$ 1,330
per year for the three fiscal years following the year of acquisition based on established increases in net revenues and achieving certain internal EBITDA goals.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the fair value of the consideration transferred was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the remaining unallocated amount recorded as goodwill.
The allocation of the fair value of the acquired business has been based on a preliminary valuation. Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change as we obtain additional information for our estimates during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The primary areas of the preliminary allocation of the fair value of consideration transferred that are not yet finalized relate to the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and the residual goodwill. As of February 25, 2023, there have been no changes to the preliminary allocation of the purchase price (translated into U.S. dollars as of the acquisition date) which is as follows:
The following is a collective summary of the purchase price allocations for those acquisitions:

Goodwill was determined based on the residual difference between the fair value of the consideration transferred and the value assigned to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities recognized in connection with the acquisition and is deductible for tax purposes. Among the factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill are the expected synergies arising from combining the Company’s manufacturing and distribution capabilities with Noa Home’s position in the international e-commerce market for home furnishings and accessories.

BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-UNAUDITED
FEBRUARY 25, 2023
(Dollars in thousands except share and per share data)
A portion of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the amount of $ 1,929
has been assigned to the identifiable intangible asset associated with the Noa Home trade name. This intangible asset is considered to have an indefinite life. The indefinite-lived intangible asset and goodwill are not amortized but will be tested for impairment annually or between annual tests if an indicator of impairment exists.
The fair values of consideration transferred and net assets acquired were determined using a combination of Level 2 and Level 3 inputs as specified in the fair value hierarchy in ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures .
The revenues and results of operations of Noa Home for the three months ended February 25, 2023 were not material. The pro forma impact of the acquisition has not been presented because it was not material to our consolidated results of operations for the three months ended February 26, 2022.
4. Financial Instruments and Investments
Financial Instruments
Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments in certificates of deposit (CDs), accounts receivable, and accounts payable. Because of their short maturities, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments in CDs, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value.
Investments
Our short-term investments of $ 17,725
and $ 17,715
at February 25, 2023 and November 26, 2022 consisted of CDs. At February 25, 2023, the CDs had original terms averaging
eight
months, bearing interest at rates ranging from
0.3 % to
4.75 %. At February 25, 2023, the weighted average remaining time to maturity of the CDs was approximately five months and the weighted average yield of the CDs was approximately
4.29 %. Each CD is placed with a federally insured financial institution and all deposits are within federal deposit insurance limits. Due to the nature of these investments and their relatively short maturities, the carrying amount of the short-term investments at February 25, 2023 and November 26, 2022 approximates their fair value.
5. Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consists of the following:
February 25, 2023
November 26, 2022
Gross accounts receivable
$
18,992
$

Allowance for doubtful accounts
( 684

( 1,261
)
Accounts receivable, net
$
18,308
$
17,838
We maintain an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for credit losses is based on a review of specifically identified accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis which is applied to accounts pooled on the basis of similar risk characteristics. Judgments are made with respect to the collectibility of accounts receivable within each pool based on historical experience, current payment practices and current economic trends based on our expectations over the expected life of the receivables, which is generally ninety days or less. Actual credit losses could differ from those estimates.

We believe that the carrying value of our net accounts receivable approximates fair value. The inputs into these fair value estimates reflect our market assumptions and are not observable. Consequently, the inputs are considered to be Level 3 as specified in the fair value hierarchy in ASC Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures . See Note 4.
6. Inventories
Domestic furniture inventories are valued at the lower of cost, which is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. Imported inventories and those applicable to our Lane Venture and Bassett Outdoor lines are valued at the lower of cost, which is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realizable value.
Inventories were comprised of the following:

( 4,646

( 5,167

$
79,011
$
85,477
We estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write-offs, taking into account future demand, market conditions and the respective valuations at LIFO. The need for these reserves is primarily driven by the normal product life cycle. As products mature and sales volumes decline, we rationalize our product offerings to respond to consumer tastes and keep our product lines fresh. If actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required. In determining reserves, we calculate separate reserves on our wholesale and retail inventories. Our wholesale inventories tend to carry the majority of the reserves for excess quantities and obsolete inventory due to the nature of our distribution model. These wholesale reserves primarily represent design and/or style obsolescence. Typically, product is not shipped to our retail warehouses until a consumer has ordered and paid a deposit for the product. We do not typically hold retail inventory for stock purposes. Consequently, floor sample inventory and inventory for delivery to customers account for the majority of our inventory at retail. Retail reserves are based on accessory and clearance floor sample inventory in our stores and any inventory that is not associated with a specific customer order in our retail warehouses.

outstanding under standby letters of credit against our line, leaving availability under our credit line of $ 21,269 . In addition, we had outstanding standby letters of credit with another bank totaling $ 250
at February 25, 2023. The line bears interest at the One-Month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“One-Month Term SOFR”) plus
1.5 % and is unsecured. Our bank charges a fee of
0.25 % on the daily unused balance of the line, payable quarterly. Under the terms of the bank credit facility, we must maintain the following financial covenants, measured quarterly on a rolling twelve-month basis:
●
Consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than
1.4
times,
●
Consolidated lease-adjusted leverage ratio not to exceed
3.0
times, and
●
Minimum tangible net worth of $ 140,000 .
We were in compliance with these covenants at February 25, 2023 and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future. The credit facility will mature on January 27, 2025, at which time any amounts outstanding under the facility will be due.

9. Post Employment Benefit Obligations
Defined Benefit Plans
We have an unfunded Supplemental Retirement Income Plan (the “Supplemental Plan”) that covers one current and certain former executives. The liability for the Supplemental Plan was $ 6,007
and $ 5,987
as of February 25, 2023 and November 26, 2022, respectively.
We also have the Bassett Furniture Industries, Incorporated Management Savings Plan (the “Management Savings Plan”) which was established in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Management Savings Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained for the benefit of certain highly compensated or management level employees. As part of the Management Savings Plan, we have made Long Term Cash Awards (“LTC Awards”) totaling $ 2,000
to certain management employees in the amount of $ 400
each. The liability for the LTC Awards was $ 1,300
and $ 1,275
as of February 25, 2023 and November 26, 2022, respectively.

We have an unfunded deferred compensation plan that covers one current executive and certain former executives and provides for voluntary deferral of compensation. This plan has been frozen with no additional participants or deferrals permitted. Our liability under this plan was $ 1,626
and $ 1,616
as of February 25, 2023 and November 26, 2022, respectively.
We also have an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained for the benefit of certain highly compensated or management level employees which was established under the Management Savings Plan. Our liability under this plan, including both accrued Company contributions and participant salary deferrals, was $ 2,447
and $ 2,070
as of February 25, 2023 and November 26, 2022, respectively.

10. Commitments and Contingencies
We are involved in various legal and environmental matters which arise in the normal course of business. Although the final outcome of these matters cannot be determined, based on the facts presently known, we believe that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations.
Lease Guarantees
We were contingently liable under a licensee lease obligation guarantee in the amounts of $ 1,889
and $ 1,880
at February 25, 2023 and November 26, 2022, respectively. The remaining term under this lease guarantee extends for
five
years.
In the event of default by an independent dealer under the guaranteed lease, we believe that the risk of loss is mitigated through a combination of options that include, but are not limited to, arranging for a replacement dealer or liquidating the collateral (primarily inventory). The proceeds of the above options are expected to cover the estimated amount of our future payments under the guarantee obligation, net of recorded reserves. The fair value of this lease guarantee (an estimate of the cost to the Company to perform on the guarantee) at February 25, 2023 and November 26, 2022 was not material.

13. Segment Information
Beginning with the three months ended February 25, 2023, we have strategically aligned our business into
three
reportable segments as defined in ASC 280,
Segment Reporting , and as described below:
●
Wholesale.
The wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design, manufacture, sourcing, sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of Bassett stores (Company-owned and licensee-owned retail stores) and independent furniture retailers. Our wholesale segment includes our wood and upholstery operations, which includes Lane Venture.
●
Retail
–
Company-owned stores.
Our retail segment consists of Company-owned stores and includes the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and capital expenditures directly related to these stores and the Company-owned distribution network utilized to deliver products to our retail customers.
●
Corporate and other
– Corporate and other includes the shared costs of corporate functions such as treasury and finance, information technology, accounting, human resources, legal and others, including certain product development and marketing functions benefitting both wholesale and retail operations. In addition to property and equipment and various other assets associated with the shared corporate functions, the identifiable assets of Corporate and other include substantially all of our cash and our investments in CDs. We consider our corporate functions to be other business activities and have aggregated them with our other insignificant operating segment, the recently acquired Noa Home (see Note 3).
Inter-company net sales elimination represents the elimination of wholesale sales to our Company-owned stores. Inter-company income elimination includes the embedded wholesale profit in the Company-owned store inventory that has not been realized. These profits will be recorded when merchandise is delivered to the retail consumer. The inter-company income elimination also includes rent paid by our retail stores occupying Company-owned real estate.
Prior to the current period, the functions included in Corporate and other were included in our wholesale segment reportable segment, and Noa Home was included in our retail reportable segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 following its acquisition on September 2, 2022. We believe that the new alignment of our reporting segments provides our chief operating decision maker with clearer information with which to assess the operating results of our wholesale segment. Noa Home does not meet the requirements to be a separate reportable segment as it is below the thresholds of the revenue, income and asset tests. The segment information presented below for the three months ended February 26, 2022 and as of November 26, 2022 has been restated to reflect the new alignment of our reportable segments.
Our former logistical services segment which represented the operations of Zenith is now presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying condensed consolidated balances sheets and statements of income (see Note 12).

See Note 14, Revenue Recognition, for disaggregated revenue information regarding sales of furniture and accessories by product type for the wholesale and retail segments.
14. Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. For our wholesale and retail segments, revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product have transferred to the buyer. At wholesale, transfer occurs and revenue is recognized upon the shipment of goods to independent dealers and licensee-owned BHF stores. At retail, transfer occurs and revenue is recognized upon delivery of goods to the customer. All wholesale and retail revenues are recorded net of estimated returns and allowances based on historical patterns. We typically collect a significant portion of the purchase price from our retail customers as a deposit upon order, with the balance typically collected upon delivery. These customer deposits are carried on our balance sheet as a current liability until delivery is fulfilled and amounted to $ 31,040
and $ 35,963
as of February 25, 2023 and November 26, 2022, respectively. Approximately
81 % of the customer deposits held at November 26, 2022 related to performance obligations that were satisfied during the current year-to-date period and have therefore been recognized in revenue for the three months ended February 25, 2023.

(Dollars in thousands except share and per share data)
Sales commissions are expensed as part of selling, general and administrative expenses at the time revenue is recognized because the amortization period would have been one year or less. Sales commissions at wholesale are accrued upon the shipment of goods. Sales commissions at retail are accrued at the time a sale is written (i.e. – when the customer’s order is placed) and are carried as prepaid commissions in other current assets until the goods are delivered and revenue is recognized. At February 25, 2023 and November 26, 2022, our balance of prepaid commissions included in other current assets was $ 3,145
and $ 3,768 , respectively.
We exclude from revenue all amounts collected from customers for sales tax. We do not disclose amounts allocated to remaining unsatisfied performance obligations as they are expected to be satisfied within one year or less.
Disaggregated revenue information for sales of furniture and accessories by product category for the three months ended February 25, 2023 and February 26, 2022, excluding intercompany transactions between our segments, is a follows:

16. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2021-08– Business Combinations (Topic 805) Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the recognition of an acquired contract liability and to payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. The amendments in ASU 2021-08 require that an entity (acquirer) recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. At the acquisition date, an acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with Topic 606 as if it had originated the contracts. The amendments in ASU 2021-08 will become effective for us as of the beginning of our 2024 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. We do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position and results of operations.
In March 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-02 – Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, to address certain concerns identified in the Post-Implementation Review process for ASU Topic 326. The amendments in ASU 2022-02 eliminate the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors in ASC Subtopic 310-40, Receivables – Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, for public business entities, the amendments in ASU 2022-02 require that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses – Measured at Amortized Cost. The amendments in ASU 2022-02 will become effective for us as of the beginning of our 2024 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. We expect that the adoption of this standard will primarily impact our disclosures but do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position and results of operations.
In June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-03 – Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, to clarify the guidance in Topic 820 when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security. The amendments in ASU 2022-03 clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. In addition, the amendments in ASU 2022-03 require certain additional disclosures related to investments in equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The amendments in ASU 2022-03 will become effective for us as of the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. As of February 25, 2023 we do not hold any investments in equity securities, therefore we do not currently expect that this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position and results of operations.

Overview
Bassett is a leading retailer, manufacturer and marketer of branded home furnishings. Our products are sold primarily through a network of Company-owned and licensee-owned branded stores under the Bassett Home Furnishings (“BHF”) name, with additional distribution through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers. We also sell our products through our website at
www.bassettfurniture.com . We were founded in 1902 and incorporated under the laws of Virginia in 1930. Our rich 121-year history has instilled the principles of quality, value, and integrity in everything we do, while simultaneously providing us with the expertise to respond to ever-changing consumer tastes and meet the demands of a global economy.
With 92 BHF stores at February 25, 2023, we have leveraged our strong brand name in furniture into a network of Company-owned and licensed stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly and casual environment for buying furniture and accessories.  Our store program is designed to provide a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish, quality furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service.  In order for the Bassett brand to reach markets that cannot be effectively served by our retail store network, we also distribute our products through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers. We use a network of over 30 independent sales representatives who have stated geographical territories. These sales representatives are compensated based on a standard commission rate. We believe this blended strategy provides us the greatest ability to effectively distribute our products throughout the United States and ultimately gain market share.
The BHF stores feature custom order furniture, free in-home or virtual design visits (“home makeovers”) and coordinated decorating accessories.  Our philosophy is based on building strong long-term relationships with each customer.  Sales people are referred to as “Design Consultants” and are trained to evaluate customer needs and provide comprehensive solutions for their home decor.  Until a rigorous training and design certification program is completed, Design Consultants are not authorized to perform in-home or virtual design services for our customers.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we opened our first regional fulfillment center (“RFC”) in Orlando, Florida where we are stocking our best sellers for much quicker delivery. This adds an element of immediacy to our proven platform of made to order custom furniture that has driven our strategy for the past two decades. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we opened our second RFC near Baltimore, Maryland. In the first quarter of 2023, we opened three more RFCs in Conover, North Carolina, Grand Prairie, Texas and Riverside, California. We plan to evaluate the performance of these five RFCs before considering any additional locations.
In 2018, we added outdoor furniture to our offerings with the acquisition of the Lane Venture brand. Our strategy is to distribute these products outside of our BHF store network through a network of over 10 independent sales representatives. Using Lane Venture as a platform, we developed the Bassett Outdoor brand that is only marketed through the BHF store network. This allows Bassett branded product to move from inside the home to outside the home to capitalize on the growing trend of outdoor living.
We have factories in Newton, North Carolina that manufacture both stationary and motion upholstered furniture for inside the home along with our outdoor furniture offerings. We also have factories in Martinsville and Bassett, Virginia that assemble and finish our custom bedroom and dining offerings. Late in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we purchased a facility which we had formerly leased in Haleyville, Alabama where we manufacture aluminum frames for our outdoor furniture. With the purchase, we also obtained two additional buildings which will allow us to expand our footprint at that facility. Our manufacturing team takes great pride in the breadth of its options, the precision of its craftsmanship, and the speed of its manufacturing process.
In addition to the furniture that we manufacture domestically, we source most of our formal bedroom and dining room furniture (casegoods) and certain leather upholstery offerings from several foreign plants, primarily in Vietnam, Thailand and China. Over 75% of our wholesale revenues are derived from products that are manufactured in the United States using a mix of domestic and globally sourced components and raw materials.

(Dollars in thousands except share and per share data)
We consider our website to be the front door to our brand experience where customers can research our furniture and accessory offerings and subsequently buy online or engage with an in-store design consultant. Customer acquisition resulting from our digital outreach strategies has significantly increased our traffic to the website since 2019. The migration to digital brand research has caused us to comprehensively evaluate all of our American made custom products. While our Bench Made line of custom upholstery and custom bedroom and dining products continue to be our most successful offerings, most of these items must be purchased in a store as they are not conducive to web transactions due to the number of options available. Consequently, we will continue to methodically re-design each one of these important lines to best serve our customers online, in the store or wherever our customer might be. Our intent is to continue to offer the consumer custom options that will help them personalize their home but to do so in an edited fashion that will provide a better web experience in the research phase and will also allow the final purchase to be made either on the web or in the store. While we work to make it easier to purchase either in store or on-line, we will not compromise our in-store experience or the quality of our in-home makeover capabilities.
We are engaged in a multi-year cross-functional digital transformation initiative with the first phase consisting of the examination and improvement of our underlying data management processes. During the second quarter of 2022, we implemented a comprehensive Product Information Management system which allows us to enhance and standardize our product development and data management and governance processes. This results in more consistent data that our merchandizing and sales teams can use in analyzing various product and sales trends in order to make better informed decisions. We are also in the process of implementing a new eCommerce platform that we plan to introduce in the second half of 2023.  The new web platform will leverage world class features including enhanced customer research capabilities and streamlined navigation that we believe will result in increased web traffic and sales. We expect to spend approximately $2,000 on these efforts in 2023.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we acquired Noa Home (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisition). A mid-priced e-commerce furniture retailer headquartered in Montreal, Canada, Noa Home has operations in Canada, Australia, Singapore and the United Kingdom. With a lean staffing model, the Noa Home team has built an operational blueprint that has the potential for significant growth. We believe the acquisition will provide Bassett with a greater online presence and will allow us to attract more digitally native consumers. While still in the planning phase, we expect to introduce the Noa Home brand in the United States during 2023.
Company-owned Retail Stores
As we continually monitor the performance of our Company-owned retail store locations, we may occasionally determine that it is necessary to close underperforming stores in certain markets. During 2022, we closed three stores with the operations of one those stores being consolidated into another store in the same market. All of the above-mentioned closures occurred at or near the lease expirations.
We also may occasionally identify opportunities to enhance our presence in existing markets by relocating stores to better locations within the same market. During 2022, we sold the store property of one of our Houston, Texas locations and leased a new 9,600 square foot store property in a more upscale shopping area in the vicinity of the former location. We are in the process of upfitting the store and expect to open in late 2023. During late 2022 at the end of the lease term, we closed our Dallas, Texas store located at the intersection of McKinney and Knox streets. We opened a new 11,600 square foot store in the nearby iconic Inwood Village shopping center during the first quarter of 2023.
In 2022, we acquired a 25,000 square foot property in Tampa, Florida. We will begin upfitting the property early in April with a planned opening date in late 2023.
As of February 25, 2023, we had 59 Corporate-owned stores operating.
Sale of the Assets of Zenith Freight Lines, LLC
During the first quarter of 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Zenith, to J.B. Hunt and the transaction was completed at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2022. As a result of the sale, the operations of our former logistical services segment, which consisted entirely of the operations of Zenith, are presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income and in the following discussion as discontinued operations (see Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income).

Analysis of Quarterly Results:
Total sales revenue for the three months ended February 25, 2023 decreased $10,166 or 8.6% from the prior year period primarily due to a 16% decline in wholesale sales partially offset by a 1.3% increase in retail sales through the Company-owned stores and the addition of Noa Home in 2023.
Gross margins for the three months ended February 25, 2023 increased 440 basis points from 2022 primarily due to higher margins in the wholesale segment along with a greater portion of total sales coming from the Corporate retail segment. These increases were partially offset by lower margins in the retail segment.
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as a percentage of sales for the three months ended February 25, 2023 increased 740 basis points from 2022 primarily due to a greater portion of total sales coming from the Corporate retail segment along with the deleverage of fixed costs caused by lower sales volumes.
Segment Information
Beginning with the three months ended February 25, 2023, we have strategically aligned our business into three reportable segments as defined in ASC 280,
Segment Reporting , and as described below:
●
Wholesale.
The wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design, manufacture, sourcing, sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of Bassett stores (Company-owned and licensee-owned retail stores) and independent furniture retailers. Our wholesale segment includes our wood and upholstery operations, which includes Lane Venture.
●
Retail
–  Company-owned stores.
Our retail segment consists of Company-owned stores and includes the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and capital expenditures directly related to these stores and the Company-owned distribution network utilized to deliver products to our retail customers.
●
Corporate and other
– Corporate and other includes the shared costs of corporate functions such as treasury and finance, information technology, accounting, human resources, legal and others, including certain product development and marketing functions benefitting both wholesale and retail operations. We consider our corporate functions to be other business activities and have aggregated them with our other insignificant operating segment, the recently acquired Noa Home.
Inter-company net sales elimination represents the elimination of wholesale sales to our Company-owned stores. Inter-company income elimination includes the embedded wholesale profit in the Company-owned store inventory that has not been realized. These profits will be recorded when merchandise is delivered to the retail consumer. The inter-company income elimination also includes rent paid by our retail stores occupying Company-owned real estate.
Prior to the current period, the functions included in Corporate and other were included in our wholesale segment reportable segment, and Noa Home was included in our retail reportable segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 following its acquisition on September 2, 2022. We believe that the new alignment of our reporting segments provides our chief operating decision maker with clearer information with which to assess the operating results of our wholesale segment. Noa Home does not meet the requirements to be a separate reportable segment. The segment information presented below for the three months ended February 26, 2022 has been restated to reflect the new alignment of our reportable segments.

Reconciliation of Segment Results to Consolidated Results of Operations
To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we present gross profit by segment inclusive of the effects of intercompany sales by our wholesale segment to our retail segment. Because these intercompany transactions are not eliminated from our segment presentations and because we do not present gross profit as a measure of segment profitability in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the presentation of gross profit by segment is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. The reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is presented below along with the effects of various other intercompany eliminations on our consolidated results of operations.

Analysis of Quarterly Results
–
Wholesale
Net sales for the three months ended February 25, 2023 decreased $13,601 or 16% from the prior year period due primarily to a 29% decrease in shipments to the open market, a 20% decrease in Lane Venture shipments and a 3.4% decrease in shipments to our retail store network. Gross margins for the three months ended February 25, 2023 improved 230 basis points over the prior year as we were able to recognize a greater portion of previously implemented price increases in current period sales. This was offset by lower margins in the Bassett Leather product line due to product discounting. As this product line is internationally sourced with extended lead times, we received significant amounts of inventory during the second and third quarters of 2022 just as product demand was weakening due to the market downturn in home furnishings. Also, the ocean freight costs associated with the majority of the product received was at significantly higher costs than are currently being realized on current product receipts. We expect reduced margins on this product line to continue through the third quarter of 2023 as we reduce the inventory to a more normal level. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increased 160 basis points primarily due to reduced leverage of fixed costs from decreased sales along with higher warehousing and shipping costs.
Wholesale Backlog
Wholesale backlog at February 25, 2023 was $24,895 as compared to $35,336 at November 26, 2022 and $78,135 at February 26, 2022. While wholesale orders for the first quarter of 2023 decreased 18% against the prior year period, they were 5.6% higher than the pre-pandemic level of the first quarter of 2020.

Quarterly Analysis of Results - Retail
Net sales for the three months ended February 25, 2023 increased $855 or 1.3% from the prior year period. Written sales (the value of sales orders taken but not delivered) declined 16% from the first quarter of 2022. Gross margins for the three months ended February 25, 2023 were flat compared to the prior period as increased promotional activity in the current quarter coupled with higher in-bound freight costs were offset by lower unit costs as measured on a last-in, first-out basis. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for the three months ended February 25, 2023 increased 180 basis points primarily due to increased advertising costs to drive more customer engagement, higher consumer financing costs from higher interest rates and increased warehousing and delivery costs.
Retail Backlog
Retail backlog at February 25, 2023 was $41,763 compared to $51,041 at November 26, 2022 and $84,645 at February 26, 2022. Although the retail backlog continues to be elevated as compared to pre-pandemic levels, we expect a more normalized and sustainable level by the end of the second quarter of 2023.

The first quarter of 2022 was the final period during which Zenith operated as a consolidated subsidiary of Bassett. During the three months ended February 26, 2022, Zenith generated a pre-tax profit of $1,712 on sales to third party customers of $16,776.
Zenith also charged Bassett $9,121 for logistical services provided to our wholesale segment during the three months ended February 26, 2022. These shipping and handling costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income. Upon the sale of Zenith, we entered into a service agreement with J.B. Hunt for the continuation of these services for a period of seven years. We incurred $8,434 of expense during the three months ended February 25, 2023 for logistical services performed by J.B. Hunt.
Other Items Affecting Net Income
Other Loss, Net
Other loss, net, for the three months ended February 25, 2023 and February 26, 2022 was $415 and $629, respectively, a net decrease of $214 from the prior year period. The net change was primarily due to higher interest income on our investment in certificates of deposit.
Income Taxes
We calculate an anticipated effective tax rate for the year based on our annual estimates of pretax income and use that effective tax rate to record our year-to-date income tax provision.  Any change in annual projections of pretax income could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate for the respective quarter.
Our effective tax rate was 36.8% and 26.3% for the three months ended February 25, 2023 and February 26, 2022, respectively. These effective rates differ from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to increases in the valuation allowance placed on deferred tax assets associated with Noa Home, the effects of state income taxes and various permanent differences.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows
Cash provided by operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was $563 compared to cash provided by operations of $2,866 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, representing a decrease of $2,303 in cash flows from operations. Cash provided by the operating activities of our discontinued operations was $1,681 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding the decline in operating cash flow from discontinued operations, cash flows from continuing operations declined $622 for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 from the prior year period. This decline was primarily the result of lower income from continuing operations and reduced customer deposits from lower written retail sales, partially offset by reduced investment in inventory.
Our overall cash position decreased by $6,733 during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to a decline of $2,484 during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, an increased net use of $4,239 from the prior year period. Excluding the overall cash flow from discontinued operations, overall cash flow from continuing operations decreased $3,074 from the prior year period. In addition to the decline in cash flows from operations, net cash used in investing activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $1,024 to $3,904 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $2,880 for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures over the prior year primarily consisting of expenditures related to our digital transformation project, upfit of the recently opened Inwood store in Dallas, TX and the remodel of two other stores in the Dallas, TX market. We expect capital expenditures for the full year to range from $17 million to $20 million. Net cash used in financing activities during the first quarter of 2022 increased $883 to a net use of $3,363 as compared to a net use of $2,480 for the prior year period, primarily due to a $1,079 increase in share repurchases to $1,844 during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to $765 repurchased during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. As of February 25, 2023, $24,154 remains available for future purchases under our stock repurchase plan. With cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $72,617 on hand at February 25, 2023, expected future operating cash flows and the availability under our credit line noted below, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for the foreseeable future.
Debt and Other Obligations
Our bank credit facility provides for a line of credit of up to $25,000. At February 25, 2023, we had $3,731 outstanding under standby letters of credit against our line, leaving availability under our credit line of $21,269. In addition, we had outstanding standby letters of credit with another bank totaling $250 at February 25, 2023. The line bears interest at the One-Month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“One-Month Term SOFR”) plus 1.5% and is unsecured. Our bank charges a fee of 0.25% on the daily unused balance of the line, payable quarterly. Under the terms of the bank credit facility, we must maintain the following financial covenants, measured quarterly on a rolling twelve-month basis:
●
Consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.4 times,
●
Consolidated lease-adjusted leverage ratio not to exceed 3.0 times, and
●
Minimum tangible net worth of $140,000.
We were in compliance with these covenants at February 25, 2023 and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future. The credit facility will mature on January 27, 2025, at which time any amounts outstanding under the facility will be due.
We lease land and buildings that are used in the operation of our Company-owned retail stores as well as in the operation of certain of our licensee-owned stores, and we lease land and buildings used in our wholesale manufacturing operations. We also lease local delivery trucks used in our retail segment. The present value of our obligations for leases with terms in excess of one year at February 25, 2023 is $113,120 and is included in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at February 25, 2023. We were contingently liable under a licensee lease obligation guarantee in the amount of $1,889 at February 25, 2023. The remaining term under this lease guarantee extends for five years. See Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our lease guarantees.
Investment in Retail Real Estate
We have a substantial investment in real estate acquired for use as retail locations and occupied by Company-owned retail stores, including a site in Tampa, Florida acquired in 2022 with a planned opening late in fiscal 2023. Such real estate is included in property and equipment, net, in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and consists of eight properties with an aggregate square footage of 203,465 and a net book value of $21,164 at February 25, 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 26, 2022.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We utilize stand-by letters of credit in the procurement of certain goods in the normal course of business. In addition, we have guaranteed certain lease obligations of licensee operators for some of their store locations. See Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of lease guarantees, including descriptions of the terms of such commitments and methods used to mitigate risks associated with these arrangements.
Contingencies
We are involved in various legal and environmental matters which arise in the normal course of business. Although the final outcome of these matters cannot be determined, based on the facts presently known, it is our opinion that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. See Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding certain contingencies as of February 25, 2023.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk:
We are exposed to market risk from changes in the value of foreign currencies. Substantially all of our imports purchased outside of North America are denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, we believe that gains or losses resulting from changes in the value of foreign currencies relating to foreign purchases not denominated in U.S. dollars would not be material to our results from operations in fiscal 2023. We are also exposed to foreign currency market risk through our investment in Noa Home. Our investment in Noa Home is subject to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. Additionally, Noa Home is exposed to other local currency fluctuation risk through its operations in Australia, Singapore and the United Kingdom. The impact of currency fluctuations on our financial position and results of operations since the acquisition of Noa Home on September 2, 2022 has not been significant.
We are exposed to market risk from changes in the cost and availability of raw materials used in our manufacturing processes, principally wood, woven fabric, and foam products.  The cost of foam products, which are petroleum-based, is sensitive to changes in the price of oil.
We are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices for fuel used in our retail segment for home delivery as well as through amounts we are charged for logistical services by our service providers. We manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges to our customers.
We have potential exposure to market risk related to conditions in the commercial real estate market. Our retail real estate holdings of $21,164 at February 25, 2023 for Company-owned stores could suffer significant impairment in value if we are forced to close additional stores and sell or lease the related properties during periods of weakness in certain markets. Additionally, if we are required to assume responsibility for payment under the lease obligations of $1,889 which we have guaranteed on behalf of licensees as of February 25, 2023 we may not be able to secure sufficient sub-lease income in the current market to offset the payments required under the guarantees. We are also exposed to risk related to conditions in the commercial real estate rental market with respect to the right-of-use assets we carry on our balance sheet for leased retail store locations, manufacturing and warehouse facilities. At February 25, 2023, the unamortized balance of such right-of-use assets used in continuing operations totaled $95,966. Should we have to close or otherwise abandon one of these leased locations, we could incur additional impairment charges if rental market conditions do not support a fair value for the right of use asset in excess of its carrying value.
