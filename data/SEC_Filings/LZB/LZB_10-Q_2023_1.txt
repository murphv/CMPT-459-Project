The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements. 8 Table of Contents LA-Z-BOY INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Note 1:
Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of La-Z-Boy Incorporated and our majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"). We derived the April 30, 2022 balance sheet from our audited financial statements. We prepared the interim financial information in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which we applied on a basis consistent with those reflected in our fiscal 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), but the information does not include all of the disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. In management’s opinion, the interim financial information includes all adjustments and accruals, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments (except as otherwise disclosed), that are necessary for a fair statement of results for the respective interim periods. The interim results reflected in the accompanying financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that will occur for the full fiscal year ending April 29, 2023. At January 28, 2023, we owned investments in
two
privately-held companies consisting of non-marketable preferred shares, warrants to purchase common shares, and convertible notes. Each of these companies is a variable interest entity and we have not consolidated their results in our financial statements because we do not have the power to direct those activities that most significantly impact their economic performance and, therefore, are not the primary beneficiary. Accounting pronouncements adopted in fiscal 2023
We did not adopt any Accounting Standards Updates ("ASUs") in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted The following table summarizes additional accounting pronouncements which we have not yet adopted, but we believe will not have a material impact on our accounting policies or our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. ASU Description Adoption Date ASU 2021-08 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities From Contracts With Customers Fiscal 2024 Torreón Closure During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we made the decision to close our manufacturing facility in Torreón, Mexico as part of our initiative to drive improved efficiencies through optimized staffing levels within our plants. Torreón was the last facility to begin operating as part of our broader Mexico manufacturing expansion in fiscal 2021 and 2022 and accounted for approximately
3 % of our La-Z-Boy branded production. As a result of this action, charges were recorded within the Wholesale segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 of $ 9.2  million in selling, general, and administrative expense for the impairment of various assets, primarily long-lived assets, and $ 0.9  million in cost of sales, primarily related to severance. To determine the impairment of our long-lived assets, which included fixed assets utilized by the facility and the right-of-use-lease asset, we calculated the fair value of the Torreón asset group using the income approach based on the expected future cash flows associated with the facility, primarily those associated with an assumed sublease. Based on this evaluation, we recorded an impairment charge as the difference between the asset group's fair value and its carrying value.
Note 2:
Acquisitions None of the below acquisitions were significant to our consolidated financial statements, and, therefore, pro-forma financial information is not presented. All of our provisional purchase accounting estimates for the acquisitions completed in fiscal 2023 are based on the information and data available to us as of the time of the issuance of these financial statements, and in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification Topic 805-10-25-15, are subject to change within the first 12 months following the acquisition as we gain additional data. Each of the following Retail acquisitions completed in fiscal 2023 and 2022 reflect a core component of our strategic priorities, which is to grow our company-owned retail business and leverage our integrated retail model (where we earn a combined profit on both the wholesale and retail sales) in suitable geographic markets, alongside the existing La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
network. 9 Table of Contents Barboursville, West Virginia acquisition On December 12, 2022, we completed our acquisition of the Barboursville, West Virginia business that operates one independently owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
store. This acquisition did not have a meaningful impact on our consolidated financial statements. Spokane, Washington acquisition On September 26, 2022, we completed our acquisition of the Spokane, Washington business that operates
one
independently owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
store and
one
distribution center for $ 4.7  million, subject to customary adjustments. We paid total cash of $ 4.0  million during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and the remaining consideration includes forgiveness of accounts receivable and payments based on working capital adjustments.
Prior to this acquisition, we licensed to the counterparty the exclusive right to own and operate La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores (and to use the associated trademarks and trade name) in the Spokane, Washington market, and we reacquired these rights when we consummated the transaction. The reacquired rights are indefinite-lived because our Retailer Agreements are perpetual agreements that have no specific expiration date and no renewal options. The effective settlement of these arrangements resulted in no settlement gain or loss as the contractual terms were at market. We recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $ 1.2  million related to these reacquired rights. We also recognized $ 3.0  million of goodwill in our Retail segment related primarily to synergies we expect from the integration of the acquired store and future benefits of these synergies. For federal income tax purposes, we will amortize and appropriately deduct all of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill assets over
15
years. Denver, Colorado acquisition On July 18, 2022, we completed our acquisition of the Denver, Colorado business that operates
five
independently owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores and
one
distribution center for $ 10.1  million, subject to customary adjustments. We paid total cash of $ 7.7  million in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023 and the remaining consideration includes forgiveness of accounts receivable and payments based on working capital adjustments.
Prior to this acquisition, we licensed to the counterparty the exclusive right to own and operate La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores (and to use the associated trademarks and trade name) in the Denver, Colorado market, and we reacquired these rights when we consummated the transaction. The reacquired rights are indefinite-lived because our Retailer Agreements are perpetual agreements that have no specific expiration date and no renewal options. The effective settlement of these arrangements resulted in no settlement gain or loss as the contractual terms were at market. We recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $ 4.3  million related to these reacquired rights. We also recognized $ 7.6  million of goodwill in our Retail segment related primarily to synergies we expect from the integration of the acquired stores and future benefits of these synergies. For federal income tax purposes, we will amortize and appropriately deduct all of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill assets over
15
years. Prior Year Acquisitions Alabama and Chattanooga, Tennessee acquisition On December 6, 2021, we completed our acquisition of the Alabama and Chattanooga, Tennessee businesses that operate
four
independently owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores in Alabama and
one
in Chattanooga, Tennessee, for $ 8.3  million, subject to customary adjustments. We paid total cash of $ 8.0  million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and the remaining consideration includes forgiveness of accounts receivable and payments based on working capital adjustments.
Prior to this acquisition, we licensed to the counterparty the exclusive right to own and operate La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores (and to use the associated trademarks and trade name) in the Alabama and Chattanooga, Tennessee markets, and we reacquired these rights when we consummated the transaction. The reacquired rights are indefinite-lived because our Retailer Agreements are perpetual agreements that have no specific expiration date and no renewal options. The effective settlement of these arrangements resulted in no settlement gain or loss as the contractual terms were at market. We recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $ 4.1  million related to these reacquired rights. We also recognized $ 7.4  million of goodwill in our Retail segment related primarily to synergies we expect from the integration of the acquired stores and future benefits of these synergies. For federal income tax purposes, we will amortize and appropriately deduct all of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill assets over
15
years. 10 Table of Contents Furnico (La-Z-Boy United Kingdom Manufacturing) acquisition On October 25, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Furnico Furniture Ltd ("Furnico"), an upholstery manufacturing business in the U.K for approximately $ 13.3  million, subject to customary adjustments and in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022, we paid $ 13.9  million of cash for the purchase of the Furnico business. Furnico produces La-Z-Boy branded product for the La-Z-Boy U.K. business and also operates a wholesale business, selling white label products to key U.K. retailers. With this acquisition, we expect to realize production synergies, cost savings through materials procurement, and increases in production capacity to support growth in the La-Z-Boy U.K business. We recognized $ 9.2  million of goodwill in our Wholesale segment related primarily to synergies we expect from the integration of the acquired business and future benefits of these synergies. The goodwill asset for Furnico is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. Long Island, New York acquisition On August 16, 2021, we completed our acquisition of the Long Island, New York business that operates
three
independently owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores for $ 4.5  million, subject to customary adjustments. We paid $ 4.4  million of cash during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and the remaining consideration includes forgiveness of accounts receivable and payments based on working capital adjustments. Prior to this acquisition, we licensed to the counterparty the exclusive right to own and operate La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores (and to use the associated trademarks and trade name) in the Long Island, New York market, and we reacquired these rights when we consummated the transaction. The reacquired rights are indefinite-lived because our Retailer Agreements are perpetual agreements that have no specific expiration date and no renewal options. The effective settlement of these arrangements resulted in no settlement gain or loss as the contractual terms were at market. We recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $ 0.8  million related to these reacquired rights. We also recognized $ 4.4  million of goodwill in our Retail segment related primarily to synergies we expect from the integration of the acquired stores and future benefits of these synergies. For federal income tax purposes, we will amortize and appropriately deduct all of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill assets over
15
years. Note 3:
Cash and Restricted Cash We have restricted cash on deposit with a bank as collateral for certain letters of credit. All our letters of credit have maturity dates within the next twelve months, but we expect to renew some of these letters of credit when they mature.

Note 8:
Product Warranties We accrue an estimated liability for product warranties when we recognize revenue on the sale of warrantied products. We estimate future warranty claims on product sales based on our historical claims experience and periodically adjust the provision to reflect changes in actual experience. We incorporate repair costs into our liability estimates, including materials, labor and overhead amounts necessary to perform repairs, and any costs associated with delivering repaired product to our customers. Over
90 % of our warranty liability relates to our Wholesale reportable segment as we generally warrant our products against defects for
one
to
three years
on fabric and leather, from
one
to
ten years
on cushions and padding, and provide a limited lifetime warranty on certain mechanisms and frames, unless otherwise noted in the warranty. Additionally, our Wholesale segment warranties cover labor costs relating to our parts for
one year . We provide a limited lifetime warranty against defects on a majority of Joybird products, which are a part of our Corporate and Other results. For all our manufacturer warranties, the warranty period begins when the consumer receives our product. We use considerable judgment in making our estimates, and we record differences between our actual and estimated costs when the differences are known. A reconciliation of the changes in our product warranty liability is as follows: Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended (Unaudited, amounts in thousands) 1/28/2023 1/22/2022 1/28/2023 (1) 1/22/2022 Balance as of the beginning of the period $ 28,357   $ 25,068   $ 27,036   $ 23,636   Acquisitions —   634   —   634   Accruals during the period 8,663   7,271   24,942   21,158   Settlements during the period ( 7,722 ) ( 6,612 ) ( 22,680 ) ( 19,067 ) Balance as of the end of the period $ 29,298   $ 26,361   $ 29,298   $ 26,361   (1) $ 18.5

We recorded accruals during the periods presented in the table above, primarily to reflect charges that relate to warranties issued during the respective periods. Note 9:  Stock-Based Compensation The table below summarizes the total stock-based compensation expense we recognized for all outstanding grants in our consolidated statement of income: Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended (Unaudited, amounts in thousands) 1/28/2023 1/22/2022 1/28/2023 1/22/2022 Equity-based awards expense $ 3,377   $ 2,533   $ 8,456   $ 8,887   Liability-based awards expense

Compensation expense for these awards is based on the market price of our common stock on the grant date and is remeasured each reporting period based on the market value of our common shares on the last day of the reported period.
14 Table of Contents Stock Options.
We granted
318,411
stock options to employees during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and we have stock options outstanding from previous grants. We account for stock options as equity-based awards because when they are exercised, they will be settled in common shares. We recognize compensation expense for stock options over the vesting period equal to the fair value on the date the Compensation and Talent Oversight Committee of our board of directors approved the awards. The vesting period for our stock options ranges from
one
to
four years , with accelerated vesting upon retirement. The vesting date for retirement-eligible employees is the later of the date they meet the criteria for retirement or ten months after the grant date. We accelerate the expense for options granted to retirement-eligible employees over the vesting period, with expense recognized from the grant date through their retirement eligibility date or over the
ten months
following the grant date, whichever period is longer. We have elected to recognize forfeitures as an adjustment to compensation expense in the same period as the forfeitures occur.
We estimate the fair value of the employee stock options at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires management to make certain assumptions.
The fair value of stock options granted during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was calculated using the following assumptions: (Unaudited) Fiscal 2023 grant Assumption Risk-free interest rate 2.87 % U.S. Treasury issues with term equal to expected life at grant date Dividend rate 2.70 % Estimated future dividend rate and common share price at grant date Expected life 5.0
years Contractual term of stock option and expected employee exercise trends Stock price volatility 42.78 % Historical volatility of our common shares Fair value per option $ 7.90 Restricted Stock . We granted
256,128
shares of restricted stock units to employees during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and we also have restricted stock awards outstanding from previous grants. We issue restricted stock at no cost to employees and account for restricted stock awards as equity-based awards because when they vest, they will be settled in common shares. We recognize compensation expense for restricted stock over the vesting period equal to the fair value on the date the Compensation and Talent Oversight Committee of our board of directors approved the awards. Restricted stock awards generally vest at
25 % per year, beginning
one year
from the grant date over a term of
four years , with continued vesting upon retirement with respect to the fiscal 2023 grants. The vesting date for retirement-eligible employees is the later of the date they meet the criteria for retirement or ten months after the grant date. We accelerate the expense for restricted stock granted to retirement-eligible employees over the vesting period, with expense recognized from the grant date through their retirement eligibility date or over the
ten months
following the grant date, whichever period is longer. We have elected to recognize forfeitures as an adjustment to compensation expense in the same period as the forfeitures occur. The weighted-average fair value of the restricted stock that was awarded in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 was $ 24.58
per share, the market value of our common shares on the dates of grant.
Restricted Stock Units Issued to Directors.
Restricted stock units granted to our non-employee directors are offered at no cost to the directors and vest the earlier of the date a director ceases to be a member of the board (for any reason other than the termination of service for cause) or the-one year anniversary of the grant date. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we granted
36,656
restricted stock units to our non-employee directors. We account for these restricted stock units as equity-based awards because when they vest, they will be settled in shares of our common stock. We measure and recognize compensation expense for these awards based on the market price of our common shares on the date of grant, which was $ 26.19 . Performance Shares.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we granted
240,833
performance-based shares and we also have performance-based share awards outstanding from previous grants. Payouts of these grants depend on our financial performance ( 50 %) and a market-based condition based on the total return our shareholders receive on their investment in our stock relative to returns earned through investments in other public companies ( 50 %). The performance share opportunity ranges from
50 % of the employee’s target award if minimum performance requirements are met to a maximum of
200 % of the target award based on the attainment of certain financial and shareholder-return goals over a specific performance period, which is generally
three
fiscal years. We account for performance-based shares as equity-based awards because when they vest, they will be settled in common shares. In the event of an employee's termination during the vesting period, the potential right to earn shares under this program is generally forfeited and we have elected to recognize forfeitures as an adjustment to compensation expense in the same period in which the forfeitures occur. For shares that vest based on our results relative to the performance goals, we expense as compensation cost the fair value of the shares as of the day we granted the awards recognized over the performance period,
15 Table of Contents taking into account the probability that we will satisfy the performance goals. The fair value of each share of the awards we granted in fiscal 2023 that vest based on attaining performance goals was $ 22.43 , the market value of our common shares on the date we granted the awards less the value of the dividends we expect to pay shareholders before the shares vest. For shares that vest based on market conditions, we use a Monte Carlo valuation model to estimate each share’s fair value as of the date of grant. The Monte Carlo valuation model uses multiple simulations to evaluate our probability of achieving various stock price levels to determine our expected performance ranking relative to our peer group. For shares that vest based on market conditions, we expense compensation cost over the vesting period regardless of whether the market condition is ultimately satisfied. Based on the Monte Carlo model, the fair value as of the grant date of the fiscal 2023 grant of shares that vest based on market conditions was $ 36.63 . Note 10:

Revenue Recognition Our revenue is primarily derived from product sales. We report product sales net of discounts and recognize them when control (rights and obligations associated with the product) passes to the customer. For sales to furniture retailers or distributors, control typically transfers when we ship the product. In cases where we sell directly to the end consumer, control of the product is generally transferred upon delivery. For shipping and handling activities, we have elected to apply the accounting policy election permitted in ASC 606-10-25-18B, which allows an entity to account for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities (rather than as a promised good or service) when the activities are performed even if those activities are performed after the control of the good has been transferred. We expense shipping and handling costs at the time we recognize revenue in accordance with this election. For sales tax, we have elected to apply the accounting policy election permitted in ASC 606-10-32-2A, which allows an entity to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by the entity from a customer, including sales, use, excise, value-added, and franchise taxes (collectively referred to as sales taxes). This allows us to present revenue net of these certain types of taxes. We have elected the practical expedient permitted in ASC 606-10-32-18, which allows an entity to recognize the promised amount of consideration without adjusting for the effects of a significant financing component if the contract has a duration of one year or less. As our contracts typically are less than one year in length and do not have significant financing components, we have not adjusted consideration. 17 Table of Contents The following table presents our revenue disaggregated by product category and by segment or unit: Quarter Ended January 28, 2023 Quarter Ended January 22, 2022 (Unaudited, amounts in thousands) Wholesale Retail Corporate and Other Total Wholesale Retail Corporate and Other Total Motion Upholstery Furniture $ 224,726   $ 153,194   $ 5   $ 377,925   $ 238,119   $ 113,767   $ 288   $ 352,174   Stationary Upholstery Furniture 97,736   52,497   35,248   185,481   94,216   46,938   55,971   197,125   Bedroom Furniture 9,853   2,189   3,121   15,163   6,723   1,598   3,674   11,995   Dining Room Furniture 6,926   3,300   1,025   11,251   5,562   2,802   1,063   9,427   Occasional Furniture 11,550   9,567   875   21,992   7,396   6,672   1,153   15,221   Delivery 50,008   6,881   1,654   58,543   45,168   6,342   2,097   53,607   Other

We receive customer deposits from end consumers before we recognize revenue and in some cases we have the unconditional right to collect the remaining portion of the order price before we fulfill our performance obligation, resulting in a contract asset and a corresponding deferred revenue liability. In our consolidated balance sheet, customer deposits and deferred revenue (collectively, the "contract liabilities") are reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities while contract assets are reported as other current assets.
The following table presents our contract assets and liabilities:

Segment Information Our reportable operating segments include the Wholesale segment and the Retail segment.
Wholesale Segment . Our Wholesale segment consists primarily of
three
operating segments: La-Z-Boy, our largest operating segment, our England subsidiary, and our casegoods operating segment that sells furniture under
three
brands: American Drew ® , Hammary ®
and Kincaid ® . The Wholesale segment also includes our international wholesale and manufacturing businesses. We aggregate these operating segments into
one
reportable segment because they are economically similar and meet the other aggregation criteria for determining reportable segments. Our Wholesale segment manufactures and imports upholstered furniture, such as recliners and motion furniture, sofas, loveseats, chairs, sectionals, modulars, ottomans and sleeper sofas and imports casegoods (wood) furniture, such as bedroom sets, dining room sets, entertainment centers and occasional pieces. The Wholesale segment sells directly to La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores, operators of La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio ®
locations, England Custom Comfort Center locations, major dealers, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers. Retail Segment . Our Retail segment consists of
one
operating segment comprised of our
167
company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores. The Retail segment sells primarily upholstered furniture, in addition to some casegoods and other accessories, to end consumers through these stores. Corporate & Other.
Corporate & Other includes the shared costs for corporate functions, including human resources, information technology, finance and legal, in addition to revenue generated through royalty agreements with companies licensed to use the La-Z-Boy ®
brand name on various products. We consider our corporate functions to be other business activities and have aggregated them with our other insignificant operating segments, including our global trading company in Hong Kong and Joybird, an e-commerce retailer that manufactures upholstered furniture, such as sofas, loveseats, chairs, ottomans, sleeper sofas and beds, and also imports casegoods (wood) furniture, such as occasional tables and other accessories. Joybird sells to the end consumer primarily online through its website, www.joybird.com. None of the operating segments included in Corporate & Other meet the requirements of reportable segments. 19 Table of Contents The following table presents sales and operating income (loss) by segment: Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended (Unaudited, amounts in thousands) 1/28/2023 1/22/2022 1/28/2023 1/22/2022 Sales Wholesale segment: Sales to external customers $ 291,170   $ 328,533   $ 934,511   $ 973,973   Intersegment sales 116,433   94,748   361,141   281,899   Wholesale segment sales 407,603   423,281   1,295,652   1,255,872   Retail segment sales 251,157   197,052   739,330   571,319   Corporate and Other: Sales to external customers 30,396   45,988   114,305   126,953   Intersegment sales 3,114   3,991   11,572   11,673   Corporate and Other sales 33,510   49,979   125,877   138,626   Eliminations ( 119,547 ) ( 98,739 ) ( 372,713 ) ( 293,572 ) Consolidated sales $ 572,723   $ 571,573   $ 1,788,146   $ 1,672,245   Operating Income (Loss) Wholesale segment $ 16,940   $ 27,639   $ 81,558   $ 89,098   Retail segment 44,203   24,102   123,855   68,502   Corporate and Other ( 18,303 ) ( 12,254 ) ( 48,047 ) ( 29,629 ) Consolidated operating income 42,840   39,487   157,366   127,971   Interest expense ( 136 ) ( 160 ) ( 414 ) ( 713 ) Interest income 2,012   806   3,624   1,029   Other income (expense), net ( 1,062 ) ( 1,460 ) ( 834 ) ( 522 ) Income before income taxes $ 43,654   $ 38,673   $ 159,742   $ 127,765   Note 13:
Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was
27.7 % and
26.6 % for the third quarter and nine months ended January 28, 2023, respectively, compared with
24.8 % and
25.9 % for the third quarter and nine months ended January 22, 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2022 was lower partially due to non-taxable gains on corporate owned life insurance and state taxes. Our effective tax rate varies from the
21 % federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes.

Earnings per Share The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators we used in our computations of basic and diluted earnings per share: Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended (Unaudited, amounts in thousands, except per share data) 1/28/2023 1/22/2022 1/28/2023 1/22/2022 Numerator (basic and diluted): Net income attributable to La-Z-Boy Incorporated $ 31,726   $ 28,467   $ 116,291   $ 92,549   Income allocated to participating securities

The values for contingent common shares set forth above reflect the dilutive effect of common shares that we would have issued to employees under the terms of performance-based share awards if the relevant performance period for the award had been the reporting period. We exclude the effect of options from our diluted share calculation when the weighted average exercise price of the options is higher than the average market price, since including the options' effect would be anti-dilutive. For the third quarter and nine months ended January 28, 2023, we excluded options to purchase
1.5
million shares from the diluted share calculation. For the third quarter and nine months ended January 22, 2022, we excluded options to purchase
0.2
million shares from the diluted share calculation. Note 15:
Fair Value Measurements Accounting standards require that we put financial assets and liabilities into one of three categories based on the inputs we use to value them: • Level 1 — Financial assets and liabilities, the values of which are based on unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in an active market that we have the ability to access. • Level 2 — Financial assets and liabilities, the values of which are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or on model inputs that are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. • Level 3 — Financial assets and liabilities, the values of which are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.  Accounting standards require that in making fair value measurements, we use observable market data when available. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, we categorize the fair value measurement as being in the lowest level that is significant to the measurement. We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which they occur. In addition to assets and liabilities that we record at fair value on a recurring basis, we are required to record assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis. We measure non-financial assets such as other intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-lived assets at fair value when there is an indicator of impairment, and we record them at fair value only when we recognize an impairment loss. Refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation, for additional information.
21 Table of Contents The following table presents the fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at January 28, 2023 and April 30, 2022. There were no transfers into or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 for any of the periods presented. At January 28, 2023 Fair Value Measurements (Unaudited, amounts in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 NAV(1) Total Assets Marketable securities $ —   $ 21,044   $ 2,737   $ 6,886   $ 30,667   Held-to-maturity investments 1,404   —   —   —   1,404   Cost basis investments —   —   7,579   —   7,579   Total assets $ 1,404   $ 21,044   $ 10,316   $ 6,886   $ 39,650   At April 30, 2022 Fair Value Measurements (Unaudited, amounts in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 NAV(1) Total Assets Marketable securities $ —   $ 33,578   $ 2,500   $ 6,543   $ 42,621   Held-to-maturity investments 1,337   —   —   —   1,337   Cost basis investment —   —   7,579   —   7,579   Total assets $ 1,337   $ 33,578   $ 10,079   $ 6,543   $ 51,537   Liabilities Contingent consideration liability $ —   $ —   $ 800   $ —   $ 800   (1) Certain marketable securities investments are measured at fair value using net asset value per share under the practical expedient methodology.
At January 28, 2023 and April 30, 2022, we held marketable securities intended to enhance returns on our cash and to fund future obligations of our non-qualified defined benefit retirement plan, our executive deferred compensation plan and our performance compensation retirement plan. We also held other fixed income and cost basis investments. The fair value measurements for our Level 1 and Level 2 securities are based on quoted prices in active markets, as well as through broker quotes and independent valuation providers, multiplied by the number of shares owned exclusive of any transaction costs.
At January 28, 2023 and April 30, 2022, our Level 3 assets included investments in
two
privately-held companies consisting of non-marketable preferred shares, warrants to purchase common shares, and convertible notes. The fair value of these equity investments (preferred shares and warrants) is not readily determinable and therefore, we estimate the fair value as cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments with the same issuer. The convertible notes are recorded at fair value with the net unrealized gains and losses (that are deemed to be temporary) reported as a component of other comprehensive income, consistent with our other available-for-sale debt securities. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we invested an additional $ 0.2
million in convertible notes in one of these privately-held start-up companies. There were no other changes to the fair value of our Level 3 assets during the nine months ended January 28, 2023. Our Level 3 liability includes our contingent consideration liability resulting from the Joybird acquisition. The fair value is determined using a variation of the income approach, known as the real options method, whereby revenue and earnings are simulated over the earnout periods in a risk-neutral framework using Geometric Brownian Motion. For each simulation path, the potential earnout payments were calculated based on management’s probability estimates for achievement of the revenue and earnings milestones and then were discounted to the valuation date using a discount rate of
6.8 %.
The fair value of our contingent consideration liability as of January 28, 2023 reflects our expectation that no additional consideration will be owed based on our most recent financial projections and the terms of the earnout agreement. As a result, during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we reduced the fair value of the contingent consideration liability by its full carrying value of $ 0.8
million which was recorded as a favorable impact to selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income. There were no other changes to the fair value of our Level 3 liabilities during the nine months ended January 28, 2023. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

Introduction Our Business We are the leading global producer of reclining chairs and the second largest manufacturer/distributor of residential furniture in the United States .
The La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores retail network is the third largest retailer of single-branded furniture in the United States .
We manufacture, market, import, export, distribute and retail upholstery furniture products under the La-Z-Boy ® , England, Kincaid ® , and Joybird ®
tradenames. In addition, we import, distribute and retail accessories and casegoods (wood) furniture products   under the Kincaid ® , American Drew ® , Hammary ® , and Joybird ®
tradenames.
As of January 28, 2023, our supply chain operations included the following: • Five major manufacturing locations and ten regional distribution centers in the United States and four facilities in Mexico to support our speed-to-market and customization strategy • A logistics company that distributes a portion of our products in the United States • A wholesale sales office that is responsible for distribution of our product in the United Kingdom and Ireland • An upholstery manufacturing business in the United Kingdom • A global trading company in Hong Kong which helps us manage our Asian supply chain by establishing and maintaining relationships with our Asian suppliers, as well as identifying efficiencies and savings opportunities 23 Table of Contents During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we made the decision to close our manufacturing facility in Torreón, Mexico as part of our initiative to drive improved efficiencies through optimized staffing levels within our plants. Torreón was the last facility to begin operating as part of our broader Mexico manufacturing expansion in fiscal 2021 and 2022 and accounted for approximately 3% of our La-Z-Boy branded production. As a result of this action, charges were recorded within the Wholesale segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 of $9.2 million in selling, general, and administrative expense for the impairment of various assets, primarily long-lived assets, and $0.9 million in cost of sales, primarily related to severance. We also participate in two consolidated joint ventures in Thailand that support our international businesses: one that operates a manufacturing facility and another that operates a wholesale sales office. Additionally, we have contracts with several suppliers in Asia to produce products that support our pure import model for casegoods. We sell our products through multiple channels: to furniture retailers or distributors in the United States, Canada, and approximately 55 other countries, including the United Kingdom, China, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand, directly to consumers through retail stores that we own and operate, and through our websites, www.la-z-boy.com and www.joybird.com.
• The centerpiece of our retail distribution strategy is our network of 346 La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores and 519 La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio ®
locations, each dedicated to marketing our La-Z-Boy branded products. We consider this dedicated space to be “proprietary.”
◦ La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores help consumers furnish their homes by combining the style, comfort, and quality of La-Z-Boy furniture with our available design services. We own 167 of the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores, while the remainder are independently owned and operated.
◦ La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio ®
locations are defined spaces within larger independent retailers that are dedicated to displaying and selling La-Z-Boy branded products. All 519 La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio ®
locations are independently owned and operated. ◦ In total, we have approximately 7.6 million square feet of proprietary floor space dedicated to selling La-Z-Boy branded products in North America.
◦ We also have approximately 3.0 million square feet of floor space outside of the United States and Canada dedicated to selling La-Z-Boy branded products.
• Our other brands, England, American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid enjoy distribution through many of the same outlets, with slightly over half of Hammary’s sales originating through the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
store network.
◦ Kincaid and England have their own dedicated proprietary in-store programs with 630 outlets and approximately 1.9 million square feet of proprietary floor space.
◦ In total, our proprietary floor space includes approximately 12.5 million square feet worldwide.
• Joybird sells product primarily online and has a limited amount of proprietary retail showroom floor space including seven small-format stores in key urban markets.
Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders over the long term through executing our strategic initiatives. The foundation of our strategic initiatives is driving profitable sales growth in all areas of our business. We plan to drive growth in the following ways: • Leveraging and reinvigorating our brand with a consumer focus and expanded omni-channel presence.
Our strategic initiatives to leverage and reinvigorate our iconic La-Z-Boy brand center on a renewed focus on leveraging the compelling La-Z-Boy comfort message, accelerating our omni-channel offering, and identifying additional consumer-base growth opportunities. Our marketing platform featuring celebrity brand ambassador Kristen Bell is designed to drive brand recognition and inject youthful style and sensibility into our marketing campaign, which is intended to
enhance the appeal of our brand with a younger consumer base. Further, our goal is to connect with consumers along their purchase journey through multiple means, whether online or in person. We are driving change throughout our digital platforms to improve the user experience, with a specific focus on the ease with which customers browse through our broad product assortment, customize products to their liking, find stores to make a purchase, or purchase at www.la-z-boy.com. • Expanding the reach of our branded distribution channels, which include the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
store network and the La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio ®
locations, our store-within-a-store format . While the consumer’s purchase
24 Table of Contents journey may start digitally, our consumers also demonstrate an affinity for visiting our stores to shop, allowing us to frequently deliver the flagship La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
store, or La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio ® , experience and provide design services. We expect our strategic initiatives in this area to generate growth in our Retail segment through an increased company-owned store count and in our Wholesale segment as our proprietary distribution network expands. We are not only focused on growing the number of locations, but also on upgrading existing store locations to our new concept designs. • Growing our company-owned retail business.
We are focused on growing this business by increasing same-store sales through improved execution at the store level and by opportunistically acquiring existing La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores and opening new La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores, primarily in markets that can be serviced through our regional distribution centers, where we see opportunity for growth, or where we believe we have opportunities for further market penetration. • Accelerating the growth of the Joybird brand.
During fiscal 2019, we purchased Joybird, a leading e-commerce retailer and manufacturer of upholstered furniture with a direct-to-consumer model. We believe that Joybird is a brand with significant potential and our strategic initiatives in this area focus on fueling profitable growth through an increase in digital marketing spend to drive awareness and customer acquisition, ongoing investments in technology, an expansion of product assortment, and providing additional small-format stores in key urban markets to enhance our consumers' omni-channel experience. • Enhancing our enterprise capabilities to support the growth of our consumer brands and enable potential acquisitions for growth.
In addition to our branded distribution channels, approximately 2,200 other dealers sell La-Z-Boy products, providing us the benefit of multi-channel distribution. These outlets include some of the best-known names in the industry, including Slumberland, Nebraska Furniture Mart, Mathis Brothers and Raymour & Flanagan. We believe there is significant growth potential for our consumer brands through these retail channels. Our strategic initiatives focus on enhancing our enterprise capabilities to support the growth of our consumer brands and improving the agility of our supply chain so that it can more broadly support all our consumer brands. Our reportable operating segments include the Wholesale segment and the Retail segment.
• Wholesale Segment . Our Wholesale segment consists primarily of three operating segments: La-Z-Boy, our largest operating segment, our England subsidiary, and our casegoods operating segment that sells furniture under three brands: American Drew ® , Hammary ®
and Kincaid ® . The Wholesale segment also includes our international wholesale and manufacturing businesses. We aggregate these operating segments into one reportable segment because they are economically similar and meet the other aggregation criteria for determining reportable segments. Our Wholesale segment manufactures and imports upholstered furniture, such as recliners and motion furniture, sofas, loveseats, chairs, sectionals, modulars, ottomans and sleeper sofas and imports casegoods (wood) furniture, such as bedroom sets, dining room sets, entertainment centers and occasional pieces. The Wholesale segment sells directly to La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores, operators of La-Z-Boy Comfort Studio ®
locations, England Custom Comfort Center locations, major dealers, and a wide cross-section of other independent retailers. • Retail Segment . Our Retail segment consists of one operating segment comprised of our 167 company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
stores. The Retail segment sells primarily upholstered furniture, in addition to some casegoods and other accessories, to end consumers through these stores. • Corporate & Other.
Corporate & Other includes the shared costs for corporate functions, including human resources, information technology, finance and legal, in addition to revenue generated through royalty agreements with companies licensed to use the La-Z-Boy ®
brand name on various products. We consider our corporate functions to be other business activities and have aggregated them with our other insignificant operating segments, including our global trading company in Hong Kong and Joybird, an e-commerce retailer that manufactures upholstered furniture, such as sofas, loveseats, chairs, ottomans, sleeper sofas and beds, and also imports casegoods (wood) furniture, such as occasional tables and other accessories. Joybird sells to the end consumer primarily online through its website, www.joybird.com. None of the operating segments included in Corporate & Other meet the requirements of reportable segments. 25 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Compared with Fiscal 2022 Third Quarter La-Z-Boy Incorporated Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended (Unaudited, amounts in thousands, except percentages) 1/28/2023 1/22/2022 % Change 1/28/2023 1/22/2022 % Change Sales $ 572,723  $ 571,573  0.2% $ 1,788,146  $ 1,672,245  6.9  % Operating income 42,840  39,487  8.5% 157,366  127,971  23.0  % Operating margin 7.5% 6.9% 8.8% 7.7% Sales Consolidated sales increased $1.2 million, or 0.2%, and $115.9 million, or 7% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. The increase in sales for both periods reflects the realization of pricing and surcharge actions taken to counteract rising raw material and freight costs, along with a favorable impact from product and channel mix as sales in our Retail business grew. These increases in sales more than offset a decline in delivered unit volume. Operating Margin Operating margin, which is calculated as operating income as a percentage of sales, increased 60 basis points and 110 basis points in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago.
• Gross margin, which is calculated as gross profit as a percentage of sales, increased 460 basis points and 330 basis points in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. ◦ Changes in our consolidated mix improved gross margin by 290 basis points and 240 basis points in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, driven by growth of our Retail segment, which has a higher gross margin than our Wholesale segment.
◦ Compared with the same periods a year ago, gross margin in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023 benefited from pricing and surcharge actions taken in prior periods. ◦ The gross margin in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 was negatively impacted by higher freight and raw material costs driven by global supply chain challenges. These costs have decreased during the fiscal year, resulting in in a gross margin benefit in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the same period last year.
• Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses as a percentage of sales increased 400 basis points and 220 basis points in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. ◦ Changes in our consolidated mix increased SG&A expense as a percentage of sales by 80 basis points and 150 basis points in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, driven by growth of our Retail segment, which has a higher SG&A expense as a percentage of sales than our Wholesale segment. ◦ Charges related to the closure of our Torreón, Mexico manufacturing facility resulted in a 160 basis point and 50 basis point increase in SG&A expense as a percentage of sales in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. ◦ SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was impacted during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023 by increased investments in marketing, to pre-pandemic levels as a percentage of sales, to drive written sales. The third quarter of fiscal 2023 was further impacted by higher selling expenses, as a percentage of sales, primarily driven by higher written sales in our Retail segment. We discuss each segment’s results in the following section. 26 Table of Contents Retail Segment Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended (Unaudited, amounts in thousands, except percentages) 1/28/2023 1/22/2022 % Change 1/28/2023 1/22/2022 % Change Sales $ 251,157  $ 197,052  27.5% $ 739,330  $ 571,319  29.4  % Operating income 44,203  24,102  83.4% 123,855  68,502  80.8  % Operating margin 17.6% 12.2% 16.8% 12.0% Sales The Retail segment’s sales increased $54.1 million, or 27%, and $168.0 million, or 29% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, led by a 23% and 24% increase in delivered same-store sales for each respective period. Additionally, the Retail segment benefited from a $14.3 million and a $44.1 million increase in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, from sales related to our retail store acquisitions that occurred in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023.
Written same-store sales increased 3% but decreased 8% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. The decrease in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 reflects softer demand across the industry driven by economic uncertainty and weaker consumer sentiment relative to the prior period which saw significant increases in consumer furniture demand. Although these challenging industry trends continued through the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the benefit of pricing actions taken in prior periods and strong store-level execution with improved conversion drove an increase in written sales compared with the same period last year.
Same-store sales include the sales of all currently active stores which have been open and company-owned for each comparable period.
Operating Margin The Retail segment's operating margin increased 540 basis points and 480 basis points in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. • Gross margin increased 110 basis points and 40 basis points in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, primarily due to pricing actions taken by the Retail business to offset increases in product costs. • SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 430 basis points and 440 basis points in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, primarily due to higher delivered sales relative to selling expenses and fixed costs, mainly occupancy expenses. Wholesale Segment Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended (Unaudited, amounts in thousands, except percentages) 1/28/2023 1/22/2022 % Change
1/28/2023 1/22/2022 % Change Sales to external customers $ 291,170  $ 328,533  $ 934,511  $ 973,973  Intersegment sales 116,433  94,748  361,141  281,899  Total Sales 407,603  423,281  (3.7)% 1,295,652  1,255,872  3.2  % Operating income 16,940  27,639  (38.7)% 81,558  89,098  (8.5) % Operating margin 4.2% 6.5% 6.3% 7.1% Sales The Wholesale segment’s sales decreased $15.7 million, or 4% but increased $39.8 million, or 3% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. Over the same periods, intercompany sales from our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment increased 23% and 28%, respectively. Total sales in both periods benefited from the realization of pricing and surcharge actions taken in response to rising manufacturing costs, combined with favorable channel and product mix reflecting the shift to our La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ®
network. These benefits more than offset a decline in delivered volume in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, as we continue to work down the backlog built up in prior periods back to pre-pandemic levels, but only partially offset lower delivered volume in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 27 Table of Contents Operating Margin The Wholesale segment's operating margin decreased 230 basis points and 80 basis points in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. • Gross margin increased 300 basis points and 200 basis points in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. ◦ Gross margin increased 250 basis points and 520 basis points in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, from pricing and surcharge actions taken in response to rising raw material costs resulting from global supply challenges in prior periods. ◦ Declining freight costs drove an 80 basis point and 40 basis point increase in gross margin during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. ◦ Higher raw material costs led to a 160 basis point decrease in gross margin during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared with same period a year ago. ◦ Gross margin decreased 100 basis points in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, compared with the same period a year ago, due to higher costs related to plant inefficiencies during the first half of fiscal 2023. • SG&A expense as a percentage of sales increased 530 basis points and 280 basis points in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago
◦ Reduced fixed cost leverage and an increase in marketing expense to pre-pandemic levels, as a percentage of sales, contributed to higher SG&A expense as a percentage of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and, to a lesser extent, in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, compared with the same periods a year ago. ◦ Additionally, charges related to the closure of our Torreón, Mexico manufacturing facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, resulted in a 230 basis point and 70 basis point increase in SG&A expense as a percentage of sales in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. Corporate and Other Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended (Unaudited, amounts in thousands, except percentages) 1/28/2023 1/22/2022 % Change 1/28/2023 1/22/2022 % Change Sales $ 33,510  $ 49,979  (33.0)% $ 125,877  $ 138,626  (9.2) % Intercompany eliminations (119,547) (98,739) (21.1)% (372,713) (293,572) (27.0) % Operating loss (18,303) (12,254) (49.4)% (48,047) (29,629) (62.2) % Sales Corporate and Other sales decreased $16.5 million and $12.7 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. The change in sales was primarily led by Joybird sales which decreased 35% to $28.9 million and 11% to $109.7 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively. While Joybird sales benefited from increased online conversion, overall delivered volume declined due to lower written sales from the prior sequential quarter combined with slowing online traffic and demand challenges consistent with those recently experienced across the e-commerce home furnishings industry. Written sales for Joybird were down 21% and 14%
in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, reflecting the items noted above. Intercompany eliminations increased in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023 compared with the same periods a year ago due to higher sales from our Wholesale segment to our Retail segment. Operating Loss Our Corporate and Other operating loss increased $6.0 million and $18.4 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, primarily due to Joybird's operating loss resulting from lower sales volume and higher input costs. Additionally, operating loss was impacted in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 by increased investments in marketing to drive customer acquisition and awareness.
28 Table of Contents Non-Operating Income (Expense) Interest Income Interest income was $1.2 million and $2.6 million higher in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, primarily driven by higher interest rates.
Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $1.1 million and $0.8 million of expense in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively, primarily due to exchange rate losses. Other income (expense), net was $1.5 million and $0.5 million of expense in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2022, respectively, primarily due to unrealized losses on investments and exchange rate losses, respectively.
Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was 27.7% and 26.6% for the third quarter and nine months ended January 28, 2023, respectively, compared with 24.8% and 25.9% for the third quarter and nine months ended January 22, 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2022 was lower partially due to non-taxable gains on corporate owned life insurance and state taxes. Our effective tax rate varies from the 21% federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Our sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, cash from operations, and amounts available under our credit facility. We believe these sources remain adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, and fulfill other cash requirements for day-to-day operations and capital expenditures. We had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $284.0 million at January 28, 2023, compared with $248.9 million at April 30, 2022. In addition, we had investments to enhance our returns on cash of $15.8 million at January 28, 2023, compared with $27.2 million at April 30, 2022. The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: Nine Months Ended (Unaudited, amounts in thousands) 1/28/2023 1/22/2022 Cash Flows Provided By (Used For) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 127,052  $ 45,192  Net cash used for investing activities (57,965) (77,036) Net cash used for financing activities (33,894) (122,288) Exchange rate changes (4) (593) Change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 35,189  $ (154,725) Operating Activities During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $127.1 million. Our cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income, adjusted for non-cash items and a $42.5 million decrease in receivables. This was partially offset by a $61.2 million decrease in customer deposits, as we continue to work down our backlog to pre-pandemic levels. Investing Activities During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, net cash used for investing activities was $58.0 million,
primarily due to the following: • Cash used for capital expenditures in the period was $57.4 million compared with $58.6 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2022, which primarily related to improvements to our retail stores, new store openings, and plant upgrades to our upholstery manufacturing and distribution facilities in Neosho, Missouri. Spending on these items will continue in fiscal 2023 with full year fiscal 2023 capital expenditures expected to be in the range of $75 to $80 million. We have no material contractual commitments outstanding for future capital expenditures.
29 Table of Contents • Cash used for acquisitions was $11.9 million, primarily related to the acquisition of the Denver, Colorado and Spokane, Washington retail businesses. • Proceeds from the sale of investments, net of investment purchases, was $11.2 million. Financing Activities On October 15, 2021, we entered into a five-year $200.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be used by the Company for general corporate purposes. We may increase the size of the facility, either in the form of additional revolving commitments or new term loans, subject to the discretion of each lender to participate in such an increase, up to an additional amount of $100 million. The Credit Facility will mature on October 15, 2026 and provides us the ability to extend the maturity date for two additional one-year periods, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions. As of January 28, 2023, we have no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including, among others, financial covenants requiring a maximum consolidated net lease adjusted leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as well as customary covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make acquisitions, merge or consolidate, and dispose of certain assets. As of January 28, 2023, we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the Credit Facility. We believe our cash on hand, in addition to our available Credit Facility, will provide adequate liquidity for our business operations over the next 12 months. During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, net cash used for financing activities was $33.9 million, primarily due to the following: • Our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of company stock and we spent $5.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 to repurchase 0.2 million shares. As of January 28, 2023, 7.3 million shares remained available for repurchase pursuant to this authorization.
• Cash paid to our shareholders in quarterly dividends was $22.0 million. Our board of directors has sole authority to determine if and when we will declare future dividends and on what terms. We expect the board to continue declaring regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, but it may discontinue doing so at any time. • Cash paid for holdback payments made on prior-period acquisitions was $5.0 million for the guaranteed payments related to the acquisition of Joybird.
Exchange Rate Changes From the end of fiscal year 2022 to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, changes in exchange rates had a de minimis impact on our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, slightly impacting our cash balances held in Canada, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Other During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, there were no material changes to the information about our contractual obligations and commitments shown in the table contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. We do not expect our continuing compliance with existing federal, state and local statutes dealing with protection of the environment to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position or liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies We disclosed our critical accounting policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies or estimates during the nine months ended January 28, 2023.
