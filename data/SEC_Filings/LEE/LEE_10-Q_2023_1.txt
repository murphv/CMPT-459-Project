unaudited, interim, Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for quarterly reports.
In the opinion of management, these financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring items) necessary to present fairly the financial position of Lee Enterprises, Incorporated and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 25, 2022, and our results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
The Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in September.
Fiscal year 2023 ends on September 24, 2023, and fiscal year 2022 ended September 25, 2022.
Fiscal year 2023 and 2022 are 52-week years with 13 weeks in each quarter.
Because of seasonal and other factors, the results of operations for the three months ended December 25, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. The Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries, as well as our
82.5 % interest in INN Partners, L.C. (“BLOX Digital" formerly "TownNews”). Our
50 % interest in TNI Partners ("TNI") and our

Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by the transfer of control of the contracted goods or services to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Arrangements with multiple performance obligations:
We have various advertising and subscription agreements which include both print and digital performance obligations.
Revenue from sales agreements that contain multiple performance obligations are allocated to each obligation based on the
7 Table of Contents relative standalone selling price.
We determine standalone selling prices based on observable prices charged to customers. Contract Assets and Liabilities:
The Company’s primary source of contract liabilities is unearned revenue from subscriptions paid in advance of the service provided.
The Company expects to recognize the revenue related to unsatisfied performance obligations over the next twelve months in accordance with the terms of the subscriptions and other contracts with customers.
Revenue recognized in the three months ended December 25, 2022, that was included in the contract liability as of September 25, 2022, was $ 32.2

These costs are recorded within compensation.
Most of our contracts have original expected lengths of one year or less and revenue is earned at a rate and amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer. 3     INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATED COMPANIES TNI Partners In Tucson, Arizona, TNI, acting as agent for our subsidiary, Star Publishing Company (“Star Publishing”), and Gannets Co.

On December 25, 2022, the fair value is $ 480.8  million.
This represents a level 2 fair value measurement. During the three months ended December 25, 2022, we made
no
principal debt payments.
Future payments are contingent on the Company's ability to generate future excess cash flow, as defined in the Credit Agreement.
As of December 25, 2022, there was no excess cash flow payment due. 6     PENSION, POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS We have

Through
9 Table of Contents December 25, 2022, our liability and related expense for benefits under the plans are recorded over the service period of employees based upon annual actuarial calculations. The net periodic pension and postretirement cost (benefit) components for our plans are as follows: PENSION PLANS Three months ended

no
contributions to our pension plans.
W e have
no
required contributions to our pension plans for 2023. Multiemployer Pension Plans In prior periods, the Company effectuated withdrawals from several multiemployer plans. As of December 25, 2022, and September 25, 2022,
we had $ 23.7
million and $ 25.0
million of accrued withdrawal liabilities.
The liabilities reflect the estimated value of payments to the fund, payable over
20 -years. 7     INCOME TAXES We recorded an income tax expense of $ 0.4
million related to income before taxes of $ 2.3
million for the three months ended December 25, 2022.
We recorded an income tax expense of $ 5.4
million related to income before taxes of $ 18.6
million for the three months ended December 26, 2021.
The effective income tax rate for the three months ended December 25, 2022, was
19.4 %.
The effective income tax rate for the three months ended December 26, 2021, was
28.8 %. The primary differences between these rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% are because of state taxes, non-deductible expenses, adjustments to reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any related interest, and mark-to-market adjustments to value stock warrants. We file a consolidated federal tax return, as well as combined and separate tax returns in approximately 27 state and local jurisdictions.
We do not currently have any federal or material state income tax examinations in progress.
Our income tax returns have generally been audited or closed to audit through 2015. 10 Table of Contents 8     EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three months ended
(Thousands of Dollars and Shares, Except Per Share Data) December 25, 2022 December 26, 2021 Income attributable to Lee Enterprises, Incorporated: 1,099   12,658   Weighted average common shares 5,996   5,885   Less weighted average restricted Common Stock ( 171 ) ( 159 ) Basic average common shares 5,825   5,726   Dilutive stock options and restricted Common Stock 71   118   Diluted average common shares 5,896   5,844   Earnings per common share:     Basic 0.19   2.21   Diluted 0.19   2.17   For the three months ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021,
74,304
and
600,000
shares, respectively, were not considered in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because their inclusion would result in an anti-dilutive effect on per share amounts.
9     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Legal Proceedings We are involved in a variety of legal actions that arise in the normal course of business.
Insurance coverage mitigates potential loss for certain of these matters.
While we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these legal actions, it is our opinion that the disposition of these matters will
not
have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole. 11 Table of Contents Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations and financial condition as of and for the three months ended December 25, 2022.

Similarly, references to the “2022 Quarter” refer to the three months ended December 26, 2021. Operating Revenue Total operating revenue was $185.1 million in the 2023 Quarter, down $17.2 million, or 8.5%, compared to the prior year. 13 Table of Contents Advertising and marketing services revenue totaled $89.6 million in the 2023 Quarter, down 9.3% compared to the 2022 Quarter.
Print advertising revenues were $41.8 million in the 2023 Quarter, down 25.3% compared to the 2022 Quarter due to continued secular declines in demand for print advertising.
Digital advertising and marketing services totaled $47.7 million in the 2023 Quarter, up 11.6% compared to the 2022 Quarter.
These gains resulted from an increase in Amplified Digital revenue. Digital advertising and marketing services represented 53.3% of the 2023 Quarter total advertising and marketing services revenue, compared to 43.3% in the same period last year. Subscription revenue totaled $79.7 million in the 2023 Quarter, down 8.9% compared to the 2022 Quarter.
Decline in full access volume, consistent with historical and industry trends were partially offset by selective increases on our full access subscriptions, growth in digital-only subscribers and price increases on digital subscriptions.
Digital-only subscribers grew 25.3% since the 2022 Quarter and now total 564,000, and revenue from digital-only subscribers totaled $12.3 million, up 56% compared to the 2022 Quarter. Other revenue, which primarily consists of commercial printing revenue and digital services from BLOX Digital, decreased $0.2 million, or 1.0%, in the 2023 Quarter compared to the 2022 Quarter.
Digital services revenue totaled $4.7 million in the 2023 Quarter, a 2.2% increase compared to the 2022 Quarter.
Commercial printing revenue totaled $5.5 million in the 2023 Quarter, a 4.6% decrease compared to the 2022 Quarter, primarily driven by reduction in print volumes from our partners. Total digital revenue including digital advertising revenue, digital subscription revenue and digital services revenue totaled $64.8 million in the 2023 Quarter, an increase of 17.2% over the 2022 Quarter, and represented 35.0% of our total operating revenue in the 2023 Quarter. Equity in earnings of TNI and MNI decreased 0.1 in the 2023 Quarter. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were $175.6 million in the 2023 Quarter, a 1.8% decrease compared to the 2022 Quarter.
Cash Costs, a non-GAAP financial measure used to summarize certain operating expense (see reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures below), were down 4.9% in the 2023 Quarter. Compensation expense decreased $9.2 million in the 2023 Quarter, or 10.9%, compared to the 2022 Quarter from reductions in full time employees ("FTEs") due to continued business transformation efforts, partially offset by investments in digital talent. Newsprint and ink costs decreased $0.2 in the 2023 Quarter, or 2.8%, compared to the 2022 Quarter. The decrease is attributable to declines in newsprint volumes offset by higher newsprint prices. See Item 3, “Commodities”, included herein, for further discussion and analysis of the impact of newsprint on our business. Other operating expenses increased $0.8 in the 2023 Quarter, or 0.9%, compared to the 2022 Quarter. Other operating expenses include all operating costs not considered to be compensation, newsprint, depreciation and amortization, or restructuring costs and assets loss on sales, impairments, and other, net. The largest components are costs associated with printing and distribution of our printed products, digital cost of goods sold and facility expenses. The increase is attributable to increases in investments to fund our digital growth strategy partially offset by lower delivery and other print-related costs due to lower volumes of our print editions. Restructuring costs and other totaled $0.6 million and $3.2 million in the 2023 Quarter and 2022 Quarter, respectively. Restructuring costs and other include severance costs, litigation expenses, restructuring expenses, and advisor expenses. Restructuring costs in the 2023 Quarter are predominately severance related to our ongoing business transformation, while restructuring costs In the 2022 quarter also include costs associated with the unsolicited offer in November 2021. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $1.8 million, or 18.5%, in the 2023 Quarter. The decrease in both is attributable to assets becoming fully depreciated or amortized. Assets gain on sales, impairments and other, was a net gain of $2.6 million in the 2023 Quarter compared to a net gain of $12.3 million in the 2022 Quarter.
Assets gain on sales, impairments and other in the 2023 Quarter and in the 2022 Quarter were the result of the disposition of non-core assets, including real estate. 14 Table of Contents The factors noted above resulted in an operating income of $11.2 million in the 2023 Quarter compared to operating income of $25.1 million in the 2022 Quarter. Non-operating Income and Expense Interest expense decreased $0.3 million, or 2.4%, to $10.4 million in the 2023 Quarter, compared to the same period last year.
The decrease was due to a lower outstanding balance on our Term Loan.
Our weighted average cost of debt was 9.0% at the end of the 2023 Quarter and 2022 Quarter. Other non-operating income and expense consists of benefits associated with our pension and other postretirement plans and the fair value adjustment of our Warrants.
We recorded $0.3 million periodic pension and other postretirement benefits in the 2023 Quarter compared to $4.4 million in the 2022 Quarter.
We recorded non-operating income of $0 in the 2023 Quarter and non-operating expense of $1.9 million in the 2022 Quarter, related to the changes in the value of the Warrants. We recognized a non-cash curtailment gain of $1.0 million in the 2022 Quarter as a result of freezing certain defined benefit pension plans. Income Tax Expense We recorded an income tax expense of $0.4 million, or 19.4% of pretax income in the 2023 Quarter.
In the 2022 Quarter, we recognized an income tax expense of $5.4 million, or 28.8% of pretax income. Net Income and Earnings (losses) Per Share Net income was $1.8 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.19 for the 2023 Quarter compared to net income of $13.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.17 for the 2022 Quarter.
The change reflects the various items discussed above. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES We use non-GAAP financial performance measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the relevant GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with information presented on a GAAP basis. In this report, we present Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Costs which are non-GAAP financial performance measures that exclude from our reported GAAP results the impact of certain items consisting primarily of restructuring charges and non-cash charges.
We believe such expenses, charges and gains are not indicative of normal, ongoing operations, and their inclusion in results makes for more difficult comparisons between years and with peer group companies.
In the future, however, we are likely to incur expenses, charges and gains similar to the items for which the applicable GAAP financial measures have been adjusted and to report non-GAAP financial measures excluding such items.
Accordingly, exclusion of those or similar items in our non-GAAP presentations should not be interpreted as implying the items are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual. We define our non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, as follows:
Adjusted EBITDA
is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that enhances financial statement users' overall understanding of the operating performance of the Company.
The measure isolates unusual, infrequent, or non-cash transactions from the operating performance of the business.
This allows users to easily compare operating performance among various fiscal periods and how management measures the performance of the business.
This measure also provides users with a benchmark that can be used when forecasting future operating performance of the Company that excludes unusual, nonrecurring or one-time transactions.
Adjusted EBITDA is also a component of the calculation used by stockholders and analysts to determine the value of our business when using the market approach, which applies a market multiple to financial metrics.
It is also a measure used to calculate the leverage ratio of the Company, which is a key financial ratio monitored and used by the Company and its investors.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus non-operating expenses, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, assets loss (gain) on sales, impairments and other, restructuring costs and other, stock compensation and our 50% share of EBITDA from TNI and MNI, minus equity in earnings of TNI and MNI. 15 Table of Contents Cash Costs
represent a non-GAAP financial performance measure of operating expenses which are measured on an accrual basis and settled in cash.
This measure is useful to investors in understanding the components of the Company’s cash-settled operating costs.
Generally, the Company provides forward-looking guidance of Cash Costs, which can be used by financial statement users to assess the Company's ability to manage and control its operating cost structure.
Cash Costs are defined as compensation, newsprint and ink and other operating expenses.
Depreciation and amortization, assets loss (gain) on sales, impairments and other, other non-cash operating expenses and other expenses are excluded.
Cash Costs also exclude restructuring costs and other, which are typically settled in cash. Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Costs are reconciled to net income (loss) and operating expenses, below, the closest comparable numbers under GAAP. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (UNAUDITED) The table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial performance measure of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure: Three months ended

Our operations have historically generated strong positive cash flow and are expected to provide sufficient liquidity, together with cash on hand, to meet our requirements, primarily operating expenses, interest expense and capital expenditures.
A summary of our cash flows is included in the narrative below. Operating Activities Cash required for operating activities totaled $1.7 million in 2023 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $0.6 million in 2022, a decrease of $2.3 million.
The decrease was driven by a decrease in operating results of $4.0 million (defined as net income (loss) adjusted for non-working capital items) and an increase in working capital of $1.7 million, primarily related to unfavorable changes in
postretirement liabilities, income taxes payable, and accounts receivable. Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities totaled $4.0 million in the 2023 Period compared to cash provided by investing activities of $12.0 million in the 2022 Period.
2023 and 2022 included $4.1 million and $14.4 million, respectively, in proceeds from the sale of assets as the Company divested non-core real estate. We anticipate that funds necessary for capital expenditures, which are expected to total up to $10.0 million in 2023, and other requirements, will be available from internally generated funds. Financing Activities Cash required for financing activities totaled $0.2 million in the 2023 Period compared to $20.1 million in the 2022 Period.
Debt reduction accounted for nearly all the usage of funds in 2022. Additional Information on Liquidity Our liquidity, consisting of cash on the balance sheet, totaled $18.3 million on December 25, 2022.
This liquidity amount excludes any future cash flows from operations.
We expect all interest and principal payments due in the next twelve months will be satisfied by existing cash and our cash flows, which will allow us to maintain an adequate level of liquidity. CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS Wage Laws The United States and various state and local governments are considering increasing their respective minimum wage rates.
Most of our employees are paid more than the current United States or state minimum wage rates.
However, until changes to such rates are enacted, the impact of the changes cannot be determined.
Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates and commodity prices.
Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows.
In the normal course of business, exposure to certain of these market risks is managed as described below. INTEREST RATES ON DEBT Our debt structure, which is entirely fixed rate, eliminates the potential impact of an increase in interest rates.
We have no interest rate hedging in place. COMMODITIES Newsprint prices have remained steady after the increases in prices implemented throughout 2022 and expect to remain there for the foreseeable future.
Despite reduced consumption, the newsprint supply chain is challenged due to significant capacity reductions taken in the last two years including paper machine permanent
17 Table of Contents shutdowns, conversion to paper grades other than newsprint, and recovering demand, domestically and exports, for newsprint. Our long-term supply strategy continues to align the Company with those cost-effective suppliers most likely to continue producing and supplying newsprint to the North American market and geographically aligned with our print locations.
Where possible the Company will align supply with the lowest cost material, but may be restricted due to shipping expenses and paper production availability. A $10 per tonne price increase on 27.7-pound newsprint would result in an annualized reduction in income before taxes of approximately $0.3 million based on current and anticipated consumption trends in 2023, excluding consumption of TNI and MNI and the impact of LIFO accounting. SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN VALUE Our fixed rate debt consists of $462.6 million principal amount of the Term Loan recorded at carrying value. Item 4.    Controls and Procedures EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES As of September 25, 2022, under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Based on that evaluation the Company has concluded that, because the material weaknesses in the Company's internal control that existed as of September 25, 2022 and have not been remediated by the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.. The material weaknesses identified by the Company are described below: • Management did not maintain appropriately designed information technology general controls in the areas of user access for certain of its information systems that are relevant to the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and system of internal control over financial reporting. • Management did not maintain appropriately designed controls over data provided by third-party service organizations for which a System and Organization Controls (SOC) 1 Type 2 report is not available.
Specifically, management did not design and implement controls over the validation of the completeness and accuracy of information received from these service organizations and correspondingly relied upon by the Company in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. • Management did not maintain appropriately designed controls to validate the accuracy of the tax basis associated with certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, which resulted in an immaterial error correction associated with the Company's previously issued consolidated financial statements. Remediation Plans and Actions Management is committed to remediating the material weaknesses that have been identified and maintaining an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures.
These remediation efforts, summarized below, are intended to both address the identified material weaknesses and to enhance our overall financial control environment.
In this regard, our initiatives include: • Establishing a project team to review, evaluate, and remediate material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting.
The Company's recently expanded Corporate Compliance function will lead management's efforts related to effective control design, documentation, and implementation, as well as remediate ineffective controls. • Undergoing a complete user access review related to our information technology systems to refine user roles and establish appropriate user access to various systems that the Company relies upon in its internal controls over financial reporting, which includes enhancing user access provisioning and monitoring controls to enforce appropriate system access and segregation of duties. 18 Table of Contents • Providing training to relevant personnel reinforcing existing Company policies regarding user access and the steps and procedures required to perform the required reviews of access to Company systems. • Enhancing the design of internal controls around evaluating data provided by third-party service organizations for which a SOC 1, Type 2 is not available to validate completeness and accuracy. • Enhancing the design of internal controls to validate the accuracy of the tax basis for deferred tax assets and liabilities, including enhancing our record retention policy to include retaining documentation for complex tax items for as long as such tax items impact our consolidated financial statements. The material weaknesses will be considered remediated when management concludes that, through testing, the applicable remedial controls are designed and implemented effectively. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.    Legal Proceedings We are involved in a variety of legal actions that arise in the normal course of business.
Insurance coverage mitigates potential loss for certain of these matters.
While we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these legal actions, it is our opinion that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole. Item 1.A    Risk Factors
Except as otherwise described herein, there have been no material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our 2022 Form 10-K. In addition, the Company may, from time to time, evaluate and pursue other opportunities for growth, including through strategic investments, joint ventures, and other acquisitions.
These strategic initiatives involve various inherent risks, including, without limitation, general business risk, integration and synergy risk, market acceptance risk and risks associated with the potential distraction of management.
Such transactions and initiatives may not ultimately create value for us or our stockholders and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
