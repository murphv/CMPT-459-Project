Data does not include interest incurred by our mortgage and finance subsidiaries.
Capitalized interest amounts are shown gross before allocating any portion of impairments, if any, to capitalized interest.
The aggregate unpaid principal balance was $74.5 million and $110.2 million at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively.
Represents capitalized interest which was included as part of the assets contributed to joint ventures, as discussed in Note 18. There was no impact to the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of these transactions.
Lease payments exclude $13.7 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for office leases signed but not yet commenced as of October 31, 2022. The related ROU asset and operating lease liability are not reflected on the Company's balance sheet as of October 31, 2022.
Corporate and unallocated for the three months ended January 31, 2023 included corporate general and administrative expenses of $25.5 million, interest expense of $6.6 million (a component of Other interest in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations), and $3.0 million of other net expenses. Corporate and unallocated for the three months ended
January 31, 2022 included corporate general and administrative costs of $29.4 million, interest expense of $11.5 million and $0.5 million of other net expenses.
Cash paid for interest, net of capitalized interest, is the sum of other interest expensed, as defined above, and interest paid by our mortgage and finance subsidiaries adjusted for the change in accrued interest on notes payable, which is calculated as follows:
$26.0 million of 8.0% Senior Notes due 2027 (the "8.0% 2027 Notes") are owned by a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of HEI. Therefore, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, such notes are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of HEI.
At January 31, 2023, provides for up to $125.0 million in aggregate amount of senior secured first lien revolving loans. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we amended our Secured Credit Facility, which amendments became effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. As amended, the revolving loans thereunder have a maturity of June 30, 2024 and borrowings bear interest, at K. Hovnanian’s option, at either (i) a term secured overnight financing rate (subject to a floor of 1.00%) plus an applicable margin of 4.50% or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 3.50%. In addition, K. Hovnanian will pay an unused commitment fee on the undrawn revolving commitments at a rate of 1.00% per annum.
Other interest expensed includes interest that does not qualify for interest capitalization because our assets that qualify for interest capitalization (inventory under development) do not exceed our debt, which amounted to $6.6 million and $11.5 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Other interest also includes interest on completed homes, land in planning and fully developed lots without homes under construction, which does not qualify for capitalization and therefore is expensed as incurred. This component of other interest was $8.5 million and $1.9 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

HOVNANIAN ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED
1.
Basis of Presentation
Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. (“HEI”) conducts all of its homebuilding and financial services operations through its subsidiaries (references herein to the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to HEI and its consolidated subsidiaries and should be understood to reflect the consolidated business of HEI’s subsidiaries). Historically, the Company had
seven
reportable segments consisting of
six
homebuilding segments (Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and West) and its financial services segment. During the
fourth
quarter of fiscal
2022,
we realigned our homebuilding operating segments and determined that, in addition to our financial services segment, we now had
three
reportable homebuilding segments comprised of ( 1 ) Northeast, ( 2 ) Southeast and ( 3 ) West (see Note
17 ). All prior period amounts related to the segment change have been retrospectively reclassified to conform to the new presentation.
The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include HEI's accounts and those of all of its consolidated subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions. Noncontrolling interest represents the proportionate equity interest in a consolidated joint venture that is
not
100%
owned by the Company directly or indirectly.
The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10 -Q and Article
10
of Regulation S- X,
and accordingly, they do
not
include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form
10 -K for the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2022.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments for interim periods presented have been made, which include normal recurring accruals and deferrals necessary for a fair presentation of our condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and these differences could have a significant impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Results for interim periods are
not
necessarily indicative of the results which might be expected for a full year.
2.
Stock Compensation
During the
first
quarter of fiscal
2023,
the Board of Directors approved certain grants under a new Long-Term Incentive Program (the
“2023
LTIP”) that contain performance-based vesting conditions. The performance period for the
2023
LTIP commenced on
November 1, 2022
and will end on
October 31, 2025.
At the end of the performance period,
50 % of the awards, if any, are payable in cash-settled phantom shares and the remaining
50 % of the awards, if any, are payable in shares of Company stock, subject to a mandatory
two -year post-vesting hold period.
For the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022,
stock-based compensation expense was $ 2.1  million (pre and  post tax)
and $ 1.6
million ($ 1.1
million, net of tax), respectively. Included in stock-based compensation expense was $ 8  thousand and $ 45
thousand of stock option expense for the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022,
respectively.

( 1 )
Data does
not
include interest incurred by our mortgage and finance subsidiaries.
( 2 )
Other interest expensed includes interest that does
not
qualify for interest capitalization because our assets that qualify for interest capitalization (inventory under development) do
not
exceed our debt, which amounted to $ 6.6
million and $ 11.5
million for the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022 , respectively. Other interest also includes interest on completed homes, land in planning and fully developed lots without homes under construction, which does
not
qualify for capitalization and therefore is expensed as incurred. This component of other interest was $ 8.5
million and $ 1.9
million for the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022 , respectively.
( 3 )
Cash paid for interest, net of capitalized interest, is the sum of other interest expensed, as defined above, and interest paid by our mortgage and finance subsidiaries adjusted for the change in accrued interest on notes payable, which is calculated as follows:

4.
Reduction of Inventory to Fair Value
During the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022 , respectively, we had
361
and
382
communities under development and held for future development or sale, which we evaluated for indicators of impairment. We did
not
identify impairment indicators for any community during the  three
months ended
January 31, 2023
or
2022.
We write off certain costs when communities are redesigned, abandoned or we do
not
exercise our options. Total aggregate write-offs related to these items were
$ 0.5
million and
$ 0.1
million for the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022 , respectively. The number of lots walked away from during the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022
were
2,182
and
420 , respectively. The walk-aways occurred across each of our segments for both periods.
We decide to mothball (or stop development on) certain communities when we determine that the current performance does
not
justify further investment at the time. During the
first
quarter of fiscal
2023,
we did
not
mothball any communities, nor did we sell or re-activate any previously mothballed communities. As of both
January 31, 2023
and
October 31, 2022 , the net aggregate book value of our
two
mothballed communities was $ 1.4
million, which was net of impairments in prior periods of $ 20.3
million.
We sell and lease back certain of our model homes with the right to participate in the potential profit when each home is sold to a
third
party at the end of the respective lease. As a result of our continued involvement, these sale and leaseback transactions are considered a financing rather than a sale. Our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at
January 31, 2023
and
October 31, 2022
included inventory of $ 47.4
million and $ 48.5
million, respectively, recorded to “Consolidated inventory
not
owned,” with a corresponding amount of $ 49.3
million and $ 51.2
million, respectively, recorded to “Liabilities from inventory
not
owned” for the amount of net cash received from the transactions.
We have land banking arrangements, whereby we sell our land parcels to the land bankers and they provide us an option to purchase back finished lots on a predetermined schedule. Because of our options to repurchase these parcels, these transactions are considered a financing rather than a sale. Our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at
January 31, 2023
and
October 31, 2022
included inventory of $ 267.6
million and $ 260.1
million, respectively, recorded to “Consolidated inventory
not
owned,” with a corresponding amount of $ 160.3
million and $ 151.3
million, respectively, recorded to “Liabilities from inventory
not
owned” for the amount of net cash received from the transactions.

5.
Variable Interest Entities
The Company enters into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Under these contracts, we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right, but
not
the obligation, to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms. Under the terms of the option purchase contracts, many of the option deposits are
not
refundable at our discretion. Certain option purchase contracts
may
result in the creation of a variable interest in the entity (“VIE”) that owns the land parcel under option.
We analyze our option purchase contracts to determine whether the corresponding land sellers are VIEs and, if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. Although the Company does
not
have legal title to the underlying land, we are required to consolidate a VIE if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. In determining whether it is the primary beneficiary, the Company considers, among other things, whether it has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and whether we have the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from the VIE. As a result of our analyses, we have concluded the Company is  not
the primary beneficiary of any VIEs from which it is purchasing land under option purchase contracts.
Including deposits on our unconsolidated VIEs, at
January 31, 2023 , we had total cash deposits amounting to $ 187.7  million to purchase land and lots with a total purchase price of $ 1.8  billion. The maximum exposure to loss with respect to our land and lot options is limited to the deposits plus any pre-development costs invested in the property.
6.
Warranty Costs
We have an owner-controlled insurance program for certain of our subcontractors whereby the subcontractors pay us an insurance premium (through a reduction of amounts we would otherwise owe such subcontractors for their work on our homes) based on the risk type of the trade. We absorb the liability associated with their work on our homes as part of our overall general liability insurance at
no
additional cost to us because our existing general liability and construction defect insurance policy and related reserves for amounts under our deductible covers construction defects regardless of whether we or our subcontractors are responsible for the defect. For the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022 , we received $ 1.0
million and $ 1.2
million, respectively, from subcontractors related to the owner-controlled insurance program, which we accounted for as reductions to inventory.
We accrue for warranty costs that are covered under our existing general liability and construction defect policy as part of our general liability insurance deductible. For homes to be delivered in fiscal
2023
and previously delivered in
2022,
our deductible under our general liability insurance is or was $ 25.0
million, aggregate for construction defect and warranty claims. For bodily injury claims, our deductible per occurrence in fiscal
2023
and
2022
is or was $ 0.5
million, up to a $ 5.0
million limit in California and $ 0.25
million, up to a $ 5.0
million limit in all other states. Our aggregate retention for construction defect, warranty and bodily injury claims is or was $ 25.0
million for fiscal
2023
and
2022.
In addition, we establish a warranty accrual for lower cost-related issues to cover home repairs, community amenities and land development infrastructure that are
not
covered under our general liability and construction defect policy. We accrue an estimate for these warranty costs at the time each home is closed and control is transferred to the homebuyer. Additions and charges in the warranty reserve and general liability reserve for the  three
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022
were as follows:
Three Months Ended
January 31,
(In thousands)

Changes to pre-existing reserves
( 729 )     ( 1,049 )
Balance, end of period
$ 91,067     $ 93,353
The majority of the charges incurred during the
first
quarter of fiscal
2023
represented payments for construction defects related to the settlement of
two
litigation matters. Insurance claims paid by our insurance carriers, excluding insurance deductibles paid, were less than $ 0.1  million for both the  three
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022
for prior year deliveries.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
We are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business,
none
of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and we are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that affect the development of land and home building, sales and customer financing processes, including zoning, density, building standards and mortgage financing. These laws and regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities. This can delay or increase the cost of development or homebuilding. The significant majority of our litigation matters are related to construction defect claims. Our estimated losses from construction defect litigation matters, if any, are included in our construction defect reserves.
We also are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment, including those regulating the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, the management of storm water runoff at construction sites, the handling, use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, impacts to wetlands and other sensitive environments, and the remediation of contamination at properties that we have owned or developed or currently own or are developing (“environmental laws”). The particular environmental laws that apply to a site
may
vary greatly according to the community site, for example, due to the community, the environmental conditions at or near the site, and the present and former uses of the site. These environmental laws
may
result in delays,
may
cause us to incur substantial compliance, remediation and/or other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity. In addition, noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, obligations to remediate or take corrective action, permit revocations or other sanctions; and contamination or other environmental conditions at or in the vicinity of our developments
may
result in claims against us for personal injury, property damage or other losses.
We anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will continue to be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future. In addition, some of these laws and regulations that significantly affect how certain properties
may
be developed are contentious, attract intense political attention, and
may
be subject to significant changes over time. For example, regulations governing wetlands permitting under the federal Clean Water Act have been the subject of extensive rulemakings for many years, resulting in several major joint rulemakings by the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that have expanded and contracted the scope of wetlands subject to regulation; and such rulemakings have been the subject of many legal challenges, some of which remain pending. It is unclear how these and related developments, including at the state or local level, ultimately
may
affect the scope of regulated wetlands where we operate. Although we cannot reliably predict the extent of any effect these developments regarding wetlands, or any other requirements that
may
take effect,
may
have on us, they could result in time-consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures, which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations. In addition, our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as changes in policies, rules and regulations and their interpretations and application.
In
2015,
the condominium association of the Four Seasons at Great Notch condominium community (the “Great Notch Plaintiff”) filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Passaic County (the “Court”) alleging various construction defects, design defects, and geotechnical issues relating to the community. The operative complaint (“Complaint”) asserts claims against Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. and several of its affiliates, including K. Hovnanian at Great Notch, LLC, K. Hovnanian Construction Management, Inc., and K. Hovnanian Companies, LLC. The Complaint also asserts claims against various other design professionals and contractors. The Special Masters appointed by the Court to decide non-dispositive motions issued an opinion that (a) granted the Great Notch Plaintiff’s motion to permit it to assert a claim to pierce the corporate veil of K. Hovnanian at Great Notch, LLC to hold its alleged parent entities liable for any damages awarded against it, and (b) further stated that the Great Notch Plaintiff is
not
permitted to pursue that claim until after any trial on the underlying liability claims. To date, the Hovnanian-affiliated defendants have reached a partial settlement with the Great Notch Plaintiff as to a portion of the Great Notch Plaintiff’s claims against them for an amount immaterial to the Company. On its remaining claims against the Hovnanian-affiliated defendants, the Great Notch Plaintiff has asserted damages of approximately $ 119.5
million, which amount is potentially subject to treble damages pursuant to the Great Notch Plaintiff’s claim under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. The trial had been scheduled for
April 17, 2023;
however, the Court has adjourned the trial and has
not
yet set a new date. The Hovnanian-affiliated defendants intend to defend these claims vigorously.
In
December 2020,
the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ("NJDEP") and the Administrator of the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund (the “Spill Fund”) filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Union County against Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc., in addition to other unrelated parties, in connection with contamination at Hickory Manor, a residential condominium development. Alleged predecessors of certain defendants had used the Hickory Manor property for decades for manufacturing purposes. In
1998,
NJDEP confirmed that groundwater at this site was impacted from an off-site source. The site was later remediated, resulting in the NJDEP issuing an unconditional site-wide
No
Further Action determination letter and Covenant
Not
to Sue in
1999.
Subsequently,
one
of our affiliates was involved in redeveloping the property as a residential community. The complaint asserts claims under the New Jersey Spill Act and other state law claims and alleges that the NJDEP and the Spill Fund have incurred over $ 5.3
million since
2009
to investigate vapor intrusion at the development and to install vapor mitigation systems. Among other things, the complaint seeks recovery of the costs incurred, an order that defendants perform additional required remediation and disgorgement of profits on our affiliate’s sales of the units in the development. Discovery is ongoing. Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. intends to defend these claims vigorously.

Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Customer's Deposits
Cash equivalents include certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury bills and government money–market funds with maturities of
90
days or less when purchased. Our cash balances are held at a few financial institutions and
may,
at times, exceed insurable amounts. We believe we help to mitigate this risk by depositing our cash in major high credit quality financial institutions. At
January 31, 2023
and
October 31, 2022 , $ 13.9  million and $ 13.4  million, respectively, of our total cash and cash equivalents was in cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents.
Homebuilding "Restricted cash and cash equivalents" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $ 8.2  million and $ 13.4  million as of
January 31, 2023
and
October 31, 2022 , respectively, which primarily consists of cash collateralizing our letter of credit agreements and facilities (see Note
12 ).
Financial services restricted cash and cash equivalents, which are included in "Financial services" assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $ 31.5  million and $ 36.1  million as of
January 31, 2023
and
October 31, 2022 , respectively. Included in these balances were ( 1 ) financial services customers’ deposits of $ 28.4  million at
January 31, 2023
and $ 29.7  million as of
October 31, 2022 , respectively, which are subject to restrictions on our use, and ( 2 ) restricted cash under the terms of our mortgage warehouse lines of credit of $ 3.1  million at
January 31, 2023
and $ 6.4  million as of
October 31, 2022 , respectively.
Homebuilding "Customers deposits" are shown as a liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These liabilities are significantly more than the applicable periods’ restricted cash balances because in some states the deposits are
not
restricted from use and, in other states, we are able to release the majority of these customer deposits to cash by pledging letters of credit and surety bonds.

Mortgage Loans Held for Sale
Our wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiary, K. Hovnanian American Mortgage, LLC (“K. Hovnanian Mortgage”), originates mortgage loans, primarily from the sale of our homes. Such mortgage loans are sold in the secondary mortgage market within a short period of time of origination. Mortgage loans held for sale are collateralized by the underlying property. Loans held for sale are recorded at fair value with the changes in the value recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in “Financial services” revenue. We currently use forward sales of mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), interest rate commitments from borrowers and forward commitments to sell loans to
third
parties to protect us from interest rate fluctuations.
At
January 31, 2023
and
October 31, 2022 , $ 58.0  million and $ 92.5  million, respectively, of mortgages held for sale were pledged against our mortgage warehouse lines of credit (see Note
11 ). We
may
incur losses with respect to mortgages that were previously sold that are delinquent and which had underwriting defects, but only to the extent the losses are
not
covered by mortgage insurance or the resale value of the home. The reserves for these estimated losses are included in “Financial services” liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of both
January 31, 2023
and
2022 , we had reserves specifically for
14
identified mortgage loans, as well as reserves for an estimate of future losses on mortgages sold but
not
yet identified to us.
The activity in our loan origination reserves during the  three

Mortgages
Nonrecourse
We have nonrecourse mortgage loans for certain communities totaling $ 133.9  million and $ 144.8  million, net of debt issuance costs, at
January 31, 2023
and
October 31, 2022 , respectively, which are secured by the related real property, including any improvements, with an aggregate book value of $ 416.1  million and $ 418.9  million, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on these obligations was
7.7 % and
6.7 % at
January 31, 2023
and
October 31, 2022 , respectively, and the mortgage loan payments on each community primarily correspond to home deliveries.
Mortgage Loans
K. Hovnanian Mortgage originates mortgage loans primarily from the sale of our homes. Such mortgage loans and related servicing rights are generally sold in the secondary mortgage market within a short period of time. K. Hovnanian Mortgage finances the origination of mortgage loans through various master repurchase agreements, which are recorded in "Financial services" liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Our secured Master Repurchase Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Chase Master Repurchase Agreement”), which was amended on
January 31, 2023
to extend the maturity date to
January 31, 2024,  is a short-term borrowing facility that provides up to $ 50.0
million. The loan is secured by the mortgages held for sale and is repaid when we sell the underlying mortgage loans to permanent investors. Interest is payable monthly on outstanding advances at an adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), which was
4.63 % at
January 31, 2023 , plus the applicable margin of
2.25 % to
2.375 %. As of
January 31, 2023
and
October 31, 2022 , the aggregate principal amount of all borrowings outstanding under the Chase Master Repurchase Agreement was $ 15.7  million and $ 14.1  million, respectively.
K. Hovnanian Mortgage has another secured Master Repurchase Agreement with Customers Bank (“Customers Master Repurchase Agreement”) which is a short-term borrowing facility that provides up to $ 50.0
million through its maturity on
March 8, 2023,
which we expect to be renewed for a
one
year term. The loan is secured by the mortgages held for sale and is repaid when we sell the underlying mortgage loans to permanent investors. Interest is payable daily or as loans are sold to permanent investors on outstanding advances at the current Bloomberg Short Term Bank Yield Index ("BSBY") rate, plus the applicable margin ranging from
2.125 % to
4.5 % based on the type of loan and the number of days outstanding on the warehouse line. As of
January 31, 2023
and
October 31, 2022 , the aggregate principal amount of all borrowings outstanding under the Customers Master Repurchase Agreement was $ 20.3  million and $ 43.1  million, respectively.
K. Hovnanian Mortgage also has a secured Master Repurchase Agreement with Comerica Bank (“Comerica Master Repurchase Agreement”) which was amended on
January 12, 2023
to extend the maturity date to
January 10, 2024,
and is a short-term borrowing facility through its maturity. The Comerica Master Repurchase Agreement provides up to $ 60.0
million on the
15th
day of the last month of the Company's fiscal quarters and reverts back to up to $ 50.0
million
30
days thereafter. The loan is secured by the mortgages held for sale and is repaid when we sell the underlying mortgage loans to permanent investors. Interest is payable monthly at the daily adjusting BSBY rate, subject to a floor of
0.50 %, plus the applicable margin of
1.75 % or
3.25 % based upon the type of loan. As of
January 31, 2023
and
October 31, 2022 , the aggregate principal amount of all borrowings outstanding under the Comerica Master Repurchase Agreement was $ 22.4  million and $ 37.1  million, respectively.
The Chase Master Repurchase Agreement, Customers Master Repurchase Agreement and Comerica Master Repurchase Agreement (together, the “Master Repurchase Agreements”) require K. Hovnanian Mortgage to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests. Because of the extremely short period of time mortgages are held by K. Hovnanian Mortgage before the mortgages are sold to investors (generally a period of a few weeks), the immateriality to us on a consolidated basis of the size of the Master Repurchase Agreements, the levels required by these financial covenants, our ability based on our immediately available resources to contribute sufficient capital to cure any default, were such conditions to occur, and our right to cure any conditions of default based on the terms of the applicable agreement, we do
not
consider any of these covenants to be substantive or material. As of
January 31, 2023 , we believe we were in compliance with the covenants under the Master Repurchase Agreements.

( 2 ) At
January 31, 2023 , provides for up to $ 125.0
million in aggregate amount of senior secured
first
lien revolving loans. In the
fourth
quarter of fiscal
2022,
we amended our Secured Credit Facility, which amendments became effective in the
first
quarter of fiscal
2023.
As amended, the revolving loans thereunder have a maturity of
June 30, 2024
and borrowings bear interest, at K. Hovnanian ’ s option, at either (i) a term secured overnight financing rate (subject to a floor of
1.00 %) plus an applicable margin of
4.50 % or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of
3.50 %. In addition, K. Hovnanian will pay an unused commitment fee on the undrawn revolving commitments at a rate of
1.00 % per annum .
General
Except for K. Hovnanian, the issuer of the notes and borrower under the Credit Facilities (as defined below), our home mortgage subsidiaries, certain of our title insurance subsidiaries, joint ventures and subsidiaries holding interests in our joint ventures, we and each of our subsidiaries are guarantors of the Credit Facilities, the senior secured notes and senior notes outstanding at
January 31, 2023
(except for the
8.0%
2027
Notes which are
not
guaranteed by K. Hovnanian at Sunrise Trail III, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) (collectively, the “Notes Guarantors”).
The credit agreements governing the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing the senior secured and senior notes (together, the “Debt Instruments”) outstanding at
January 31, 2023
do
not
contain any financial maintenance covenants, but do contain restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of HEI and certain of its subsidiaries, including K. Hovnanian, to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends and make distributions on common and preferred stock, repay/repurchase certain indebtedness prior to its respective stated maturity, repurchase (including through exchanges) common and preferred stock, make other restricted payments (including investments), sell certain assets (including in certain land banking transactions), incur liens, consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. The Debt Instruments also contain customary events of default which would permit the lenders or holders thereof to exercise remedies with respect to the collateral (as applicable), declare the loans made under the Unsecured Term Loan Facility (defined below) (the “Unsecured Term Loans”), loans made under the Secured Term Loan Facility (defined below) (the “Secured Term Loans”) and loans made under the Secured Credit Agreement (as defined below) (the “Secured Revolving Loans”) or notes to be immediately due and payable if
not
cured within applicable grace periods, including the failure to make timely payments on the Unsecured Term Loans, Secured Term Loans, Secured Revolving Loans or notes or other material indebtedness, cross default to other material indebtedness, the failure to comply with agreements and covenants and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency, with respect to the Unsecured Term Loans, Secured Term Loans and Secured Revolving Loans, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties and with respect to the Unsecured Term Loans, Secured Term Loans and Secured Revolving Loans, a change of control, and, with respect to the Secured Term Loans, Secured Revolving Loans and senior secured notes, the failure of the documents granting security for the obligations under the secured Debt Instruments to be in full force and effect, and the failure of the liens on any material portion of the collateral securing the obligations under the secured Debt Instruments to be valid and perfected. As of
January 31, 2023 , we believe we were in compliance with the covenants of the Debt Instruments.

Table of Contents
If our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is less than
2.0
to
1.0,
as defined in the applicable Debt Instrument, we are restricted from making certain payments, including dividends (in each such case, our secured debt leverage ratio must also be less than
4.0
to
1.0 ), and from incurring indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness and nonrecourse indebtedness. Beginning as of
October 31, 2021,
as a result of our improved operating results, our fixed coverage ratio was above
2.0
to
1.0
and our secured debt leverage ratio was below
4.0
to
1.0,
therefore we were
no
longer restricted from paying dividends. As such, we made dividend payments of $ 2.7
million to preferred shareholders in the
first
quarter of both fiscal
2023
and
2022.
Market conditions continue to adversely impact our business, and it is therefore likely that by the end of fiscal
2023
we will be restricted under our Debt Instruments from continuing to pay dividends on our Series A preferred stock. Dividends on the Series A preferred stock are
not
cumulative and, accordingly, if for any reason we do
not
declare a dividend on the Series A preferred stock for a quarterly dividend period (regardless of our availability of funds), holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will have
no
right to receive a dividend for that period, and we will have
no
obligation to pay a dividend for that period.
Under the terms of our Debt Instruments, we have the right to make certain redemptions and prepayments and, depending on market conditions, our strategic priorities and covenant restrictions,
may
do so from time to time. We also continue to actively analyze and evaluate our capital structure and explore transactions to simplify our capital structure and to strengthen our balance sheet, including those that reduce leverage, interest rates and/or extend maturities, and will seek to do so with the right opportunity. We
may
also continue to make debt or equity purchases and/or exchanges from time to time through tender offers, exchange offers, redemptions, open market purchases, private transactions, or otherwise, or seek to raise additional debt or equity capital, depending on market conditions and covenant restrictions.
Secured Obligations
On
October 31, 2019,
K. Hovnanian, HEI, the Notes Guarantors, Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative agent, and affiliates of certain investment managers (the “Investors”), as lenders, entered into a credit agreement (the “Secured Credit Agreement” and, together with the Unsecured Term Loan Facility (defined below) and the Secured Term Loan Facility, the “Credit Facilities”) providing for up to $ 125.0

June 30, 2024

On
December 10, 2019,
K. Hovnanian entered into a Senior Secured
1.75
Lien Term Loan Credit Facility due
January 31, 2028 ( the “Secured Term Loan Facility”). The secured term loans under the Secured Term Loan Facility (the “Secured Term Loans”) bear interest at a rate equal to
10.0%
per annum and will mature on
January 31, 2028,
with interest payable in arrears on the last business day of each fiscal quarter. At any time and from time to time prior to
November 15, 2023,
K. Hovnanian

Each series of secured notes and the guarantees thereof, the Secured Term Loans and the guarantees thereof and the Secured Credit Agreement and the guarantees thereof are secured by the same assets. Among the secured debt, the liens securing the Secured Credit Agreement are senior to the liens securing all of K. Hovnanian’s other secured notes and the Secured Term Loan. The liens securing the
1.125
Lien Notes are senior to the liens securing the
1.25

As of
January 31, 2023 , the collateral securing the Secured Credit Agreement, the Secured Term Loan Facility and the secured notes included ( 1 ) $ 242.3
million of cash and cash equivalents, which included $ 5.8
million of restricted cash collateralizing certain letters of credit (subsequent to such date, fluctuations as a result of cash uses include general business operations and real estate and other investments along with cash inflow primarily from deliveries); ( 2 ) $ 470.7

not
include the impact of inventory investments, home deliveries or impairments thereafter and which
may
differ from the value if it were appraised; and ( 3 ) equity interests in joint venture holding companies with an aggregate book value of $ 96.9

million and $ 6.0
million letters of credit outstanding at
January 31, 2023  and
October 31, 2022,
respectively. These agreements and facilities require us to maintain specified amounts of cash as collateral in segregated accounts to support the letters of credit issued thereunder, which will affect the amount of cash we have available for other uses. At
January 31, 2023  and
October 31, 2022,
the amount of cash collateral in these segregated accounts was $ 5.8

Preferred Stock
On
July  12,
2005,
we issued
5,600
shares of
7.625 % Series A preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $ 25,000
per share. Dividends on Series A preferred stock are
not
cumulative and are payable at an annual rate of
7.625%.
The Series A preferred stock is
not
convertible into the Company’s common stock and is redeemable in whole or in part at our option at the liquidation preference of the shares. The Series A preferred stock is traded as depositary shares, with each depositary share representing
1/1000th  of a share of Series A preferred stock. During both the  three
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022  we paid dividends of $ 2.7  million on the Series A preferred stock.
15.
Common Stock
Each share of Class A common stock entitles its holder to
one
vote per share, and each share of Class B common stock generally entitles its holder to
ten
votes per share. The amount of any regular cash dividend payable on a share of Class A common stock will be an amount equal to
110 % of the corresponding regular cash dividend payable on a share of Class B common stock. If a shareholder desires to sell shares of Class B common stock, such stock must be converted into shares of Class A common stock at a
one -to- one
conversion rate.

On
August  4,
2008,
our Board of Directors (the “Board”) adopted a shareholder rights plan (the “Rights Plan”), which was amended on
January 11, 2018
and
January 18, 2021,
designed to preserve shareholder value and the value of certain tax assets primarily associated with net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and built-in losses under Section  382
of the Internal Revenue Code. Our ability to use NOLs and built-in losses would be limited if there was an “ownership change” under Section  382.
This would occur if shareholders owning (or deemed under Section  382
to own)
5 % or more of our stock increase their collective ownership of the aggregate amount of our outstanding shares by more than
50  percentage points over a defined period of time. The Rights Plan was adopted to reduce the likelihood of an “ownership change” occurring as defined by Section  382.
Under the Rights Plan,
one
right was distributed for each share of Class A common Stock and Class B common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on
August  15,
2008.
Effective
August  15,
2008,
if any person or group acquires
4.9 % or more of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock without the approval of the Board, there would be a triggering event causing significant dilution in the voting power of such person or group. However, existing shareholders who owned, at the time of the Rights Plan’s initial adoption on
August 4, 2008,
4.9 % or more of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock will trigger a dilutive event only if they acquire additional shares. The approval of the Board’s decision to adopt the Rights Plan
may
be terminated by the Board at any time, prior to the Rights being triggered. The Rights Plan will continue in effect until
August  14,
2024,
unless it expires earlier in accordance with its terms. The approval of the Board’s decision to initially adopt the Rights Plan and the amendments thereto were approved by shareholders. Our shareholders also approved an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to restrict certain transfers of Class A common stock in order to preserve the tax treatment of our NOLs and built-in losses under Section  382
of the Internal Revenue Code. Subject to certain exceptions pertaining to pre-existing
5%
shareholders and holders of Class B common stock, the transfer restrictions in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation generally restrict any direct or indirect transfer (such as transfers of our stock that result from the transfer of interests in other entities that own our stock) if the effect would be to (i) increase the direct or indirect ownership of our stock by any person (or public group) from less than
5 % to
5 % or more of our common stock; (ii) increase the percentage of our common stock owned directly or indirectly by a person (or public group) owning or deemed to own
5 % or more of our common stock; or (iii) create a new “public group” (as defined in the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations). Transfers included under the transfer restrictions include sales to persons (or public groups) whose resulting percentage ownership (direct or indirect) of common stock would exceed the
5 % thresholds discussed above, or to persons whose direct or indirect ownership of common stock would by attribution cause another person (or public group) to exceed such threshold.
On
July 3, 2001,
the Board authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to
0.2
million shares of Class A common stock. On
September 1, 2022,  the Board terminated our prior repurchase program and authorized a new program for the repurchase of up to $ 50.0  million of our Class A common stock. Under the new repurchase program, repurchases
may  be made from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual dollar amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price, future tax implications and economic and market conditions. The repurchase program
may  be changed, suspended or discontinued at any time and does  not  have a specified expiration date.
During the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023 ,  we repurchased
118,478  shares under the new stock repurchase program, with a market value of $ 4.8  million, or $ 40.51  per share, which were added to "Treasury stock" on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
January 31, 2023.  There were  no  shares repurchased during the  three
months ended
January 31, 2022 .  As of
January 31, 2023,
$ 33.0  million of our Class A common stock is available to be purchased under the stock repurchase program.

Income Taxes
The total income tax benefit for the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023
was $ 0.7
million. The benefit was primarily due to $ 6.2
million of energy efficient tax credits on homes closed in the prior fiscal year, which was offset by federal and state tax expense as a result of pretax income.
The total income tax expense for the
three
months ended
January 31, 2022
was $ 10.6
million. The expense was primarily due to federal and state tax expense recorded as a result of our pretax income. The federal tax expense is
not
paid in cash as it is offset by the use of our existing NOL carryforwards.
Our federal net operating losses of $ 909.5
million expire between
2029
and
2038,
and $ 21.1
million have an indefinite carryforward period. Of our $ 2.3
billion of state NOLs, $ 411.4
million expire between
2023
through
2027;
$ 1.4
billion expire between
2028
through
2032;
$ 369.7
million expire between
2033
through
2037;
$ 73.7
million expire between
2038
through
2042;
and $ 51.5
million have an indefinite carryforward period.
The Company recognizes deferred income taxes for deferred tax benefits arising from NOL carryforwards and temporary differences between book and tax income which will be recognized in future years as an offset against future taxable income. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets ("DTAs") if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than
not
that some or all of the DTAs will
not
be realized. Future realization of DTAs depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character. Sources of taxable income include future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income, taxable income in prior carryback years if permitted under the tax law and tax planning strategies. Management has determined that it is more likely than
not
that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize its DTAs, net of any valuation allowance. The Company’s DTAs as of
January 31, 2023
were $ 347.4
million.
As of
January 31, 2023 , we considered all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, our valuation allowance for our DTAs was appropriate. Overall, the positive evidence, both objective and subjective, outweighed the negative evidence. The significant positive improvement in our operations in the last
three
years, coupled with our contract backlog of $ 1.2
billion as of
January 31, 2023
provided positive evidence to support the conclusion that a full valuation allowance is
not
necessary for all of our DTAs. As such, we used our go forward projections to estimate our usage of our existing federal and state DTAs. Based on this analysis, we determined that the current valuation allowance for our DTAs of $ 95.7
million as of
January 31, 2023
is appropriate.

Operating and Reporting Segments
We currently have homebuilding operations in  14  states that are aggregated into reportable segments based primarily upon geographic proximity.
Historically, the Company had
seven
reportable segments consisting of
six
homebuilding segments (Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and West) and its financial services segment. During the
fourth
quarter of fiscal
2022,
we reevaluated our reportable segments as a result of changes in the business and our management thereof. In particular, we considered the fact that, since our segments were last established, the Company had exited the Minnesota, North Carolina and Tampa markets and is currently in the process of exiting the Chicago market. Applying the principles set forth under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC")
280,
including that our business trends are reflective of economic conditions in markets with general geographic proximity, we realigned our homebuilding operating segments.
HEI’s reportable segments now consist of the following
three
homebuilding segments and a financial services segment.
Homebuilding:
( 1 )
Northeast (Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia)
( 2 ) Southeast (Florida, Georgia and South Carolina)
( 3 ) West (Arizona, California
and Texas)
All prior period amounts related to the segment change have been retrospectively reclassified throughout to conform to the new presentation.
Operations of the homebuilding segments primarily include the sale and construction of single-family attached and detached homes, attached townhomes and condominiums, urban infill and active lifestyle homes in planned residential developments. In addition, from time to time, operations of the homebuilding segments include sales of land. Operations of the financial services segment include mortgage banking and title services provided to the homebuilding operations’ customers. Our financial services subsidiaries do
not
typically retain or service mortgages that we originate but sell the mortgages and related servicing rights to investors.
Evaluation of segment performance is based primarily on income (loss) before income taxes. Income (loss) before income taxes for the homebuilding segments consist of revenues generated from the sales of homes and land, income (loss) from unconsolidated entities, management fees and other income, less the cost of homes and land sold, selling, general and administrative expenses and interest expense. Income (loss) before income taxes for the financial services segment consist of revenues generated from mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services, less the cost of such services and corporate general and administrative expenses.

Investments in Unconsolidated Homebuilding and Land Development Joint Ventures
We enter into homebuilding and land development joint ventures from time to time as a means of accessing lot positions, expanding our market opportunities, establishing strategic alliances, managing our risk profile, leveraging our capital base and enhancing returns on capital.
During the
first  quarter of fiscal
2023,
we contributed
four
communities we owned, including
one
active community, to
one
new unconsolidated joint venture for $ 41.1  million of net cash.
The tables set forth below summarize the combined financial information related to our unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures that are accounted for under the equity method.

As of
January 31, 2023
and
October 31, 2022,
we had advances outstanding of $ 3.8
million and $ 1.6
million, respectively, to these unconsolidated joint ventures. These amounts were included in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” in the tables above. In some cases, our net investment in these unconsolidated joint ventures is less than our proportionate share of the equity reflected in the table above because of the differences between asset impairments recorded against our unconsolidated joint venture investments and any impairments recorded in the applicable unconsolidated joint venture. During the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022 , we did
not
write-down any of our unconsolidated joint venture investments.

The reason “Our share of net income” in our homebuilding joint ventures is higher than the “Joint venture net income” shown in the tables above is a result of our varying ownership percentages in each investment. For both the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022,
we had investments in
eight
and
ten
unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively, and our ownership in these joint ventures ranged from
20 % to over
50%
for both periods. Therefore, depending on mix, if the unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have higher sharing percentages are more profitable than our other unconsolidated joint ventures, that results in us having a higher overall percentage of income in the aggregate than would occur if all joint ventures had the same sharing percentage; conversely, if the unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have lower sharing percentages are more profitable than our other unconsolidated joint ventures, that results in us having a lower overall percentage of income in the aggregate than would occur if all joint ventures had the same sharing percentage. For the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023,
"Our share of net income" was higher than the "Joint venture net income" due to the recognition of income in excess of our current sharing percentage for
one
of our unconsolidated joint ventures in accordance with the joint venture agreement, which provides a higher earning percentage than ownership percentage when the joint venture partner exceeds defined rate of return thresholds. This was slightly offset by a
second
unconsolidated joint venture that experienced increased income during the period for which we currently recognize a lower profit-sharing percentage based on the joint venture's agreements. In addition, we had previously written off our investment in
one
of our unconsolidated joint ventures that was generating losses and therefore for the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023
we did
not
recognize any losses on this investment. Had we
not
fully written off our investment, our share of the net loss in this unconsolidated joint venture would have been approximately
50 %, which would have reduced our overall share of net income across all of our unconsolidated joint ventures. As a result, this unconsolidated joint venture loss significantly reduced the profit when looking at all of our
eight
unconsolidated joint ventures, in the aggregate, without having any impact on our share of net income or loss recorded in the applicable period.
23
Table of Contents
To compensate us for the administrative services we provide as the manager of certain unconsolidated joint ventures, we receive a management fee based on a percentage of the applicable unconsolidated joint venture’s revenues. These management fees, which totaled $ 3.6
million and $ 2.4
million for the
three
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022 , respectively, are recorded in “Selling, general and administrative” homebuilding expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Typically, our unconsolidated joint ventures obtain separate project specific mortgage financing. For some of our unconsolidated joint ventures, obtaining financing was challenging; therefore, some of our unconsolidated joint ventures are capitalized only with equity. Any unconsolidated joint venture financing is on a nonrecourse basis, with guarantees from us limited only to performance and completion of development, environmental warranties and indemnification, standard indemnification for fraud, misrepresentation and other similar actions, including a voluntary bankruptcy filing. In some instances, the unconsolidated joint venture entity is considered a VIE due to the returns being capped to the equity holders; however, in these instances, we have determined that we are
not
the primary beneficiary, and therefore we do
not
consolidate these entities.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In
March 2020,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
2020 - 04,
“Reference Rate Reform (Topic
848 ): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting” (“ASU
2020 - 04” ). ASU
2020 - 04
provides companies with optional expedients to ease the potential accounting burden on contracts affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning on
March 12, 2020
and we
may
elect to apply the amendments prospectively. In
December 2022,
the FASB issued ASU
2022 - 06,
“Reference Rate Reform (Topic
848 ): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic
848”,
to extend the temporary accounting rules under ASC
848
from
December 31, 2022
to
December 31, 2024.
We are currently evaluating the potential impact, but we do
not
expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We use a fair-value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level
1:
Fair value determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level
2:
Fair value determined using significant other observable inputs.
Level
3:
Fair value determined using significant unobservable inputs.

million at
January 31, 2023  and
October 31, 2022,
respectively.
We elected the fair value option for our loans held for sale. Management believes the fair value option improves financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring the fair value of the loans and derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting. Fair value of loans held for sale is based on independent quoted market prices, where available, or the prices for other mortgage loans with similar characteristics.
The financial services segment had a pipeline of loan applications in process of $ 555.7
million at
January 31, 2023 . Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled $ 85.9
million as of
January 31, 2023 . Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of
60
days or less. Since a portion of these commitments are expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers, the total commitments do
not
necessarily represent future cash requirements.
The financial services segment uses investor commitments and forward sales of mandatory MBS to hedge its mortgage-related interest rate exposure. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is primarily managed by entering into MBS forward commitments and option contracts. In the event of default by the purchaser, our risk is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the MBS forward commitments and option contracts. At
January 31, 2023 , we had
no
open commitments to sell mandatory MBS.

Transactions with Related Parties
From time to time, an engineering firm owned by Tavit Najarian, a relative of Ara K. Hovnanian, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, provides services to the Company. During the
three  months ended
January 31, 2023
and
2022 , the services provided by such engineering firm to the Company totaled $ 0.4  million and $ 0.2  million, respectively. Neither the Company nor Mr. Hovnanian has a financial interest in the relative’s company from whom the services were provided.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. (“HEI”) conducts all of its homebuilding and financial services operations through its subsidiaries (references herein to the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to HEI and its consolidated subsidiaries and should be understood to reflect the consolidated business of HEI’s subsidiaries).
Segments
Historically, the Company had seven reportable segments consisting of six homebuilding segments (Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and West) and a financial services segment. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we reevaluated our reportable segments as a result of changes in the business and our management thereof. In particular, we considered the fact that, since our segments were last established, the Company had exited the Minnesota, North Carolina and Tampa markets and is currently in the process of exiting the Chicago market. Applying the principles set forth under Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, including that our business trends are reflective of economic conditions in markets with general geographic proximity, we realigned our homebuilding operating segments and determined that, in addition to our financial services segment, we now have three reportable homebuilding segments comprised of (1) Northeast, (2) Southeast and (3) West, as noted below.

The following key performance indicators are commonly used in the homebuilding industry and by management as a means to better understand our operating performance and trends affecting our business and compare our performance with the performance of other homebuilders. We believe these key performance indicators also provide useful information to investors in analyzing our performance:
●
Net contracts
is a volume indicator which represents the number of new contracts executed during the period for the purchase of homes, less cancellations of contracts in the same period. The dollar value of net contracts represents the dollars associated with net contracts executed in the period. These values are an indicator of potential future revenues;
●
Contract backlog
is a volume indicator which represents the number of homes that are under contract, but not yet delivered as of the stated date. The dollar value of contract backlog represents the dollar amount of the homes in contract backlog. These values are an indicator of potential future revenues;
●
Active selling communities
is a volume indicator which represents the number of communities which are open for sale with ten or more home sites available as of the end of a period. We identify communities based on product type; therefore, at times there are multiple communities at one land site. These values are an indicator of potential revenues;
●
Net contracts per average active selling community
is used to indicate the pace at which homes are being sold (put into contract) in active selling communities and is calculated by dividing the number of net contracts in a period by the average number of active selling communities in the same period. Sales pace is an indicator of market strength and demand; and
●
Contract cancellation rates
is a volume indicator which represents the number of sales contracts cancelled in the period divided by the number of gross sales contracts executed during the period. Contract cancellation rates as a percentage of backlog is calculated by dividing the number of cancelled contracts in the period by the contract backlog at the beginning of the period. Cancellation rates as compared to prior periods can be an indicator of market strength or weakness.
Overview
Market Conditions and Operating Results
The demand for new and existing homes is dependent on a variety of demographic and economic factors, including job and wage growth, household formation, consumer confidence, mortgage financing, interest rates, inflation and overall housing affordability.
From early January 2022, 30-year mortgage rates increased rapidly from 3.2% to a high of 7.1% at the end of October 2022, and then back down slightly to 6.1% at the end of January 2023. The quick and sharp increase in interest rates from 2021 to 2022, persistently high levels of inflation and doubt about the stability of the economy, continues to negatively impact housing demand. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we were aggressive in our pricing, incentives and concessions in order to increase affordability, which had a positive effect on our sales pace, but due to the general uncertainty potential buyers still remain cautious about their decision to purchase a home. As a result, our net contracts and net contracts per average active selling community remained adversely impacted compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, although we did see positive improvement throughout the quarter. Our gross contract cancellation rate for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was higher than the three months ended January 31, 2022 but decreased compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. For the month of January 2023 our gross contract cancellation rate was 27%, which remained above our historical average. We continue to experience extended build times due to lingering supply chain issues but given the lower volume of homes in construction we expect to see improvements resulting from an increase in available labor going forward. In addition, we have renegotiated the timing or pricing of certain land contracts and continue to build on our national initiatives to drive down costs with our vendors and trade partners who are also being affected by the difficult macro-economic environment. Although recent sales per community in January and February have begun to improve, given the slower sales pace in the second half of fiscal 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year and uncertainty in the homebuilding market, the Company will be taking measures in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to reduce its overhead expenses through a combination of workforce reductions and certain other cost reduction measures.
We expect continued pressure on our results from higher wages due to inflation, as well as increased advertising spending, and less favorable margins on the mortgage rates we offer customers in order to attract buyers. The changing conditions in the housing market caused by increased mortgage rates and other factors make it difficult to predict how strongly our business will be adversely impacted as we head into the spring selling season.

Table of Contents
Information on our operating results for the three months ended January 31, 2023 are as follows:
● Sale of homes revenues decreased to $499.6 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 from $551.4 million for the three months ended January 31, 2022. There was a 20.1% decrease in the number of home deliveries, due in part to the prior year deliveries being unusually high as a result of an extremely strong sales pace in late fiscal 2021 and early fiscal 2022. Partially offsetting the decrease in home deliveries was an increase in average prices of 13.4% for the three months ended January 31, 2023, compared to the prior year period, as home prices increased rapidly in virtually all of our markets through the first half of fiscal 2022, along with the geographic and community mix of our deliveries.
● Gross margin dollars decreased 15.0% for the three months ended January 31, 2023, as compared to the same period of the prior year, as a result of the decrease in gross margin percentage to 18.7% for the three months ended January 31, 2023 from 19.9% for the three months ended January 31, 2022. Gross margin percentage, before cost of sales interest expense and land charges, decreased from 22.4% for the three months ended January 31, 2022 to 21.8% for the three months ended January 31, 2023. The decreases were primarily due to our use of incentives and concessions to make our homes more affordable in the markets in which we operate, partially offset by a reduction in construction costs.
● Selling, general and administrative costs (including corporate general and administrative expenses) ("Total SGA") was $73.4 million, or 14.2% of total revenues, in the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared with $72.2 million, or 12.8% of total revenues, in the three months ended January 31, 2022. The increase in Total SGA as a percentage of total revenues is primarily due to the decrease in revenues for the three months ended January 31, 2023, as compared to the same period of the prior year, as discussed above.
● Other interest increased to $15.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 from $13.4 million for the three months ended January 31, 2022, primarily due to additional inventory financing resulting from an increase in average inventory not owned.
● Pre-tax income decreased to $18.0 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 from pre-tax income of $35.4 million for the three months ended January 31, 2022. Net income decreased to $18.7 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 from net income of $24.8 million for the three months ended January 31, 2022. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 included a $6.2 million tax benefit from energy efficient home credits. Earnings per share, basic and diluted, decreased to $2.37 and $2.26, respectively, for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $3.12 and $3.07, respectively, for the three months ended January 31, 2022.
● Net contracts decreased 49.2% for the three months ended January 31, 2023, compared to the same period of the prior year, as the slow sales pace across the industry during the second half of fiscal 2022 continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily as a result of fluctuating interest rates and a continuing uncertain economic outlook. However, sales pace per community did improve in each consecutive month of the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
● Net contracts per average active selling community decreased to 6.5 for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to 13.1 in the same period of the prior year. The decline was due to the decrease in net contracts discussed above.
● Contract backlog decreased from 3,624 homes at January 31, 2022 to 2,028 homes at January 31, 2023, and the dollar value of contract backlog decreased to $1.2 billion, a 37.6% decrease in dollar value compared to the prior year. The decreases were primarily attributed to lower sales and an increase in cancellations as buyers continue to try and navigate a difficult environment. Our gross contract cancellation rate of 30% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was an improvement sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 when it was 41%.
● Our cash position allowed us to spend $134.4 million on land purchases and land development during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and still have total liquidity of $365.7 million, including $234.9 million of homebuilding cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2023 and $125.0 million of borrowing capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility.

Homebuilding: Sale of Homes
For the three months ended January 31, 2023, sale of homes revenues decreased 9.4% compared to the same period in the prior year. The sale of homes revenue decrease is due to a 20.1% decrease in homes delivered, partially offset by a 13.4% increase in the average price per home for the three months ended January 31, 2023, compared with the prior year period. The average price per home increased to $532,671 in the three months ended January 31, 2023 from $469,647 in the three months ended January 31, 2022. The increase in average price was the result of increases in home prices in virtually all of our markets, primarily during the first half of fiscal 2022, along with the geographic and community mix of our deliveries. Land sales are ancillary to our homebuilding operations and are expected to continue in the future. For further detail on changes in segment revenues see “Homebuilding: Operations by Segment” below. For further detail on land sales and other revenues, see “Homebuilding: Land Sales and Other Revenues” below.

Homebuilding: Land Sales and Other Revenues
Land sales and other revenues increased $2.9 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. Other revenues include interest income, which increased as a result of an increase in rates on cash and cash equivalent accounts in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. In addition, other revenues include income from contract cancellations where deposits have been forfeited due to contract terminations, which increased due to higher cancellations in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue associated with land sales can vary significantly due to the mix of land parcels sold. There was one land sale in both of the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, and a $0.3 million increase in land sales revenue.
Homebuilding: Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes expenses for consolidated housing and land and lot sales, including inventory impairments and land option write-offs (defined as “land charges” in the tables below). A breakout of such expenses for homebuilding and land and lot sales and the gross margins for each is set forth below.
Homebuilding gross margin, before cost of sales interest expense and land charges is a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to homebuilding gross margin determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.
Management believes this non-GAAP measure enables investors to better understand our operating performance. This measure is also useful internally, helping management evaluate our operating results on a consolidated basis and relative to other companies in our industry. In particular, the magnitude and volatility of land charges for the Company, and for other homebuilders, have been significant and, as such, have made comparable financial analysis of our industry more difficult. Homebuilding metrics excluding land charges, as well as interest amortized to cost of sales, and other similar presentations prepared by analysts and other companies are frequently used to assist investors in understanding and comparing the operating characteristics of homebuilding activities by eliminating many of the differences in companies’ respective levels of impairments and debt.

We sell a variety of home types in various communities, each yielding a different gross margin. The decrease in gross margins for the three months ended January 31, 2023, was primarily due to the increase in our use of incentives and concessions to make our homes more affordable.

Land sales are ancillary to our residential homebuilding operations and are expected to continue in the future but may fluctuate significantly.
Homebuilding: Inventory Impairments and Land Option Write-Offs
Inventory impairments and land option write-offs reflects certain inventories we have either written off or written down to their estimated fair value totaling $0.5 million and $0.1 million in expense for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were no inventory impairments during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we wrote-off residential land option, approval and engineering costs. Such write-offs occurred across each of our segments in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022.
Homebuilding: Selling, General and Administrative
Homebuilding selling, general and administrative (“SGA”) expenses increased $5.2 million to $47.9 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to fees incurred on unused builder forward commitments we are offering to lower mortgage rates for our customers, which began in the second half of fiscal 2022. Also contributing to the increase in SGA was an increase in compensation expense related to merit-based salary increases.
Homebuilding: Key Performance Indicators
Net Contracts Per Average Active Selling Community
Net contracts per average active selling community for the three months ended January 31, 2023 were 6.5 compared to 13.1 for the same period in the prior year. Our reported level of sales contracts (net of cancellations) were impacted by a decrease in the pace of sales in all of our segments. As noted above, the current level of demand for new homes is significantly lower due to high levels of inflation, a sharp increase in mortgage rates from the prior year and continued concern about an economic recession. During the quarter, net contracts per average active selling community did increase from 1.5 in November to 3.0 in January as mortgage rates started to stabilize slightly during the period for potential home buyers.

Most cancellations occur within the legal rescission period, which varies by state but is generally less than two weeks after the signing of the contract. Cancellations also occur as a result of a buyer’s failure to qualify for a mortgage, which generally occurs during the first few weeks after signing. As shown in the tables above, contract cancellations over the past several years have generally been within what we believe to be a normal range, with fiscal 2021 and first half of fiscal 2022 cancellation rates, in particular, being below historical norms as a result of the strong market conditions. However, during the last three quarters, due to the sharp decline in gross sales and an increase in cancellations, our cancellation rate as a percentage of gross sales increased significantly to 27%, 41% and 30%, respectively, which is higher than our historical normal range. Additionally, our cancellation rate as a percentage of beginning backlog for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was 16%, which is also above our historical normal range of 13%. Market conditions remain uncertain and it is difficult to predict what cancellation rates will be in the future.

Contract backlog dollars decreased 37.6% as of January 31, 2023 compared to January 31, 2022, and the number of homes in backlog decreased 44.0% for the same period. The decrease in backlog dollars and number of homes for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by the slower sales environment in the second half of fiscal 2022 and first quarter of fiscal 2023.

Homebuilding Results by Segment
Northeast -
Homebuilding revenue increased 20.9% for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was attributed to a 3.6% increase in homes delivered as well as a 16.5% increase in average sales price. The increase in average sales price was the result of price increases in certain communities.
Income before income taxes increased $8.7 million to $28.5 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year. This was primarily due to the increase in homebuilding revenue discussed above, a $1.8 million decrease in SGA, and a slight increase in gross margin percentage.
Southeast
– Homebuilding revenue increased 32.8% for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was due to a 35.6% increase in homes delivered, partially offset by a 2.0% decrease in average sales price. The decrease in average sales price was the result of new communities delivering lower priced, smaller single-family homes and townhomes in lower-end submarkets of the segment for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to a mix of more deliveries in higher-end submarkets for the three months ended January 31, 2022. This decrease is partially offset by price increases in certain communities.
Income before income taxes increased $1.5 million to $11.6 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. This was primarily due to the increase in homebuilding revenue discussed above and an increase in gross margin percentage.
West
– Homebuilding revenue decreased 32.9% for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was due to a 40.2% decrease in homes delivered, partially offset by an 11.9% increase in average sales price. The increase in average sales price was the result of price increases in certain communities.
Income before income taxes decreased $34.0 million to $9.9 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in homebuilding revenue discussed above and a decrease in gross margin percentage.

Table of Contents
Financial Services
Financial services consist primarily of originating mortgages from our home buyers, selling such mortgages in the secondary market, and title insurance activities. We use mandatory investor commitments and forward sales of mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) to hedge our mortgage-related interest rate exposure on agency and government loans. For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration (“FHA/VA”) loans represented 29.1% and 24.3%, respectively, of our total loans. For the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year, our conforming conventional loan originations as a percentage of our total loans decreased from 74.6% to 70.1%, respectively. The origination of loans which exceed conforming conventions decreased to 0.8% for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to 1.1% for the same period in the prior year.
During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, financial services provided $3.1 million and $2.9 million of income before income taxes, respectively. The slight increase in financial services income before income taxes was primarily due to the decrease in total financial services costs from closing less loans in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year and an increase in the basis point spread between the loans originated and the implied rate from our sale of the loans. In the market areas served by our wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiaries, 63.3% and 64.1% of our noncash homebuyers obtained mortgages originated by these subsidiaries during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Corporate General and Administrative
Corporate general and administrative expenses include operations at our headquarters in New Jersey. These expenses include payroll, stock compensation, facility costs and rent and other costs associated with our executive offices, legal expenses, information services, human resources, corporate accounting, training, treasury, process redesign, internal audit, national and digital marketing, construction services and administration of insurance, quality and safety. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased to $25.5 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $29.4 million for the three months ended January 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense, mainly related to the grants of phantom stock awards under our 2019 long-term incentive plan, for which expense is impacted by the change in our stock price each period. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, stock awards were granted under a new Long-Term Incentive Program (the “2023 LTIP”) that consists of 50% cash-settled phantom shares and 50% equity-settled shares. The 2023 LTIP included phantom shares based on analysis that demonstrated a higher likelihood of dilution to our book value per share if the entire award was settled in shares rather than cash via phantom shares.
Other Interest
Other interest increased $1.7 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. Our assets that qualify for interest capitalization (inventory under development) are less than our debt, and therefore the portion of interest not covered by qualifying assets is directly expensed. Other interest increased primarily due to additional inventory financing resulting from an increase in average inventory not owned.
Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
Income from unconsolidated joint ventures consists of our share of the earnings or losses of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $1.0 million to $7.2 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to receiving the final distribution from one of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Income Taxes
The total income tax benefit for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $0.7 million. The benefit was primarily due to $6.2 million in energy efficient home tax credits offset by federal and state tax expense as a result of pretax income. The total income tax expense for the three months ended January 31, 2022 was $10.6 million. The expense was primarily due to federal and state tax expense recorded as a result of our pretax income. The federal tax expense is not paid in cash as it is offset by the use of our existing NOL carryforwards.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
Overview
Our total liquidity at January 31, 2023 was $365.7 million, including $234.9 million in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents and $125.0 million of borrowing capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility. We believe that our cash on hand together with available borrowings on our senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to finance our working capital requirements.
We have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under our credit facilities, the issuance of new debt and equity securities, and other financing activities. We may not be able to obtain desired financing even if market conditions, including then-current market available interest rates (in recent years, we have not been able to access the traditional capital and bank lending markets at competitive interest rates due to our highly leveraged capital structure), would otherwise be favorable, which could also impact our ability to grow our business.
Operating, Investing and Financing Cash Flow Activities
We spent $134.4 million on land and land development during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. After land and land development spending and all other operating activities, including revenue received from deliveries, cash used in operations was $31.2 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, cash used in investing activities was $23.3 million, primarily due to a new unconsolidated joint venture entered into during the period, along with the acquisition of certain fixed assets, partially offset by distributions from existing unconsolidated joint ventures. Cash used in financing activities was $48.4 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to net payments related to our mortgage warehouse lines of credit, net payments for nonrecourse mortgage financings and model sale leaseback financings, repurchases of common stock and the payment of preferred dividends, partially offset by net proceeds from land banking financings during the period. We intend to continue to use nonrecourse mortgages, model sale leasebacks, joint ventures, and, subject to covenant restrictions in our debt instruments, land banking programs as our business needs dictate.
Our cash uses during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were for operating expenses, land purchases, land deposits, land development, construction spending, model sale leasebacks, state income taxes, interest payments, preferred dividends, equity repurchases, litigation matters and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. During these periods, we provided for our cash requirements from available cash on hand, housing and land sales, land banking transactions, income from unconsolidated joint ventures, financial service revenues and other revenues.

Table of Contents
Our net income historically does not approximate cash flow from operating activities. The difference between net income and cash flow from operating activities is primarily caused by changes in inventory levels together with changes in receivables, prepaid expenses and other assets, mortgage loans held for sale, accrued interest, deferred income taxes, accounts payable and other liabilities, and noncash charges relating to depreciation, stock compensation and impairments. When we are expanding our operations, inventory levels, prepaid expenses and other assets increase causing cash flow from operating activities to decrease. Certain liabilities also increase as operations expand and partially offset the negative effect on cash flow from operations caused by the increase in inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets. Similarly, as our mortgage operations expand, net income from these operations increases, but for cash flow purposes, net income is partially offset by the net change in mortgage assets and liabilities. The opposite is true as our investment in new land purchases and development of new communities decrease, causing us to generate positive cash flow from operations.

(1) At January 31, 2023, provides for up to $125.0 million in aggregate amount of senior secured first lien revolving loans.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we amended our Secured Credit Facility, which amendments became effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.   As amended, the revolving loans thereunder have a maturity of June 30, 2024 and borrowings bear interest, at K. Hovnanian ’ s option, at either (i) a term secured overnight financing rate (subject to a floor of 1.00%) plus an applicable margin of 4.50% or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 3.50%. In addition, K. Hovnanian will pay an unused commitment fee on the undrawn revolving commitments at a rate of 1.00% per annum.
Except for K. Hovnanian, the issuer of the notes and borrower under the Credit Facilities (as defined below), our home mortgage subsidiaries, certain of our title insurance subsidiaries, joint ventures and subsidiaries holding interests in our joint ventures, we and each of our subsidiaries are guarantors of the Credit Facilities, the senior secured notes and senior notes outstanding at January 31, 2023 (except for the 8.0% Senior Notes due 2027 which are not guaranteed by K. Hovnanian at Sunrise Trail III, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) (collectively, the “Notes Guarantors”).
The credit agreements governing the Credit Facilities and the indentures governing the senior secured and senior notes (together, the “Debt Instruments”) outstanding at January 31, 2023 do not contain any financial maintenance covenants, but do contain restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of HEI and certain of its subsidiaries, including K. Hovnanian, to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends and make distributions on common and preferred stock, repay/repurchase certain indebtedness prior to its respective stated maturity, repurchase (including through exchanges) common and preferred stock, make other restricted payments (including investments), sell certain assets (including in certain land banking transactions), incur liens, consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. The Debt Instruments also contain customary events of default which would permit the lenders or holders thereof to exercise remedies with respect to the collateral (as applicable), declare the loans made under the Unsecured Term Loan Facility (defined below) (the “Unsecured Term Loans”), loans made under the Secured Term Loan Facility (defined below) (the “Secured Term Loans”) and loans made under the Secured Credit Agreement (as defined below) (the “Secured Revolving Loans”) or notes to be immediately due and payable if not cured within applicable grace periods, including the failure to make timely payments on the Unsecured Term Loans, Secured Term Loans, Secured Revolving Loans or notes or other material indebtedness, cross default to other material indebtedness, the failure to comply with agreements and covenants and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency, with respect to the Unsecured Term Loans, Secured Term Loans and Secured Revolving Loans, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties and with respect to the Unsecured Term Loans, Secured Term Loans and Secured Revolving Loans, a change of control, and, with respect to the Secured Term Loans, Secured Revolving Loans and senior secured notes, the failure of the documents granting security for the obligations under the secured Debt Instruments to be in full force and effect, and the failure of the liens on any material portion of the collateral securing the obligations under the secured Debt Instruments to be valid and perfected. As of January 31, 2023, we believe we were in compliance with the covenants of the Debt Instruments.

If our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is less than 2.0 to 1.0, as defined in the applicable Debt Instrument, we are restricted from making certain payments, including dividends (in each such case, our secured debt leverage ratio must also be less than 4.0 to 1.0), and from incurring indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness and nonrecourse indebtedness. Beginning as of October 31, 2021, as a result of our improved operating results, our fixed coverage ratio was above 2.0 to 1.0 and our secured debt leverage ratio was below 4.0 to 1.0, therefore we were no longer restricted from paying dividends. As such, we made dividend payments of $2.7 million to preferred shareholders in the first quarter of both fiscal 2023 and 2022. As discussed above, market conditions continue to adversely impact our business, and it is therefore likely that by the end of fiscal 2023 we will be restricted under our Debt Instruments from continuing to pay dividends on our Series A preferred stock. Dividends on the Series A preferred stock are not cumulative and, accordingly, if for any reason we do not declare a dividend on the Series A preferred stock for a quarterly dividend period (regardless of availability of funds), holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will have no right to receive a dividend for that period, and we will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that period.
Under the terms of our Debt Instruments, we have the right to make certain redemptions and prepayments and, depending on market conditions, our strategic priorities and covenant restrictions, may do so from time to time (for example, we redeemed $100 million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes during the second quarter of fiscal 2022). We also continue to actively analyze and evaluate our capital structure and explore transactions to simplify our capital structure and to strengthen our balance sheet, including those that reduce leverage, interest rates and/or extend maturities, and will seek to do so with the right opportunity. We may also continue to make debt or equity purchases and/or exchanges from time to time through tender offers, exchange offers, redemptions, open market purchases, private transactions, or otherwise, or seek to raise additional debt or equity capital, depending on market conditions and covenant restrictions.
Any liquidity-enhancing or other capital raising or refinancing transaction will depend on identifying counterparties, negotiation of documentation and applicable closing conditions and any required approvals. Due to covenant restrictions in our Debt Instruments, we are currently limited in the amount of debt we can incur, even if market conditions, including then-current market available interest rates (in recent years, we have not been able to access the traditional capital and bank lending markets at competitive interest rates due to our highly leveraged capital structure), would otherwise be favorable, which could also impact our ability to grow our business.
See Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of K. Hovnanian’s Credit Facilities, senior secured notes and senior notes, including information with respect to the collateral securing our secured Debt Instruments.
Mortgages and Notes Payable
We have nonrecourse mortgage loans for certain communities totaling $133.9 million and $144.8 million (net of debt issuance costs) at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively, which are secured by the related real property, including any improvements, with an aggregate book value of $416.1 million and $418.9 million, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on these obligations was 7.7% and 6.7% at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively, and the mortgage loan payments on each community primarily correspond to home deliveries.
Our wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiary, K. Hovnanian American Mortgage, LLC (“K. Hovnanian Mortgage”), originates mortgage loans primarily from the sale of our homes. Such mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold in the secondary mortgage market within a short period of time. K. Hovnanian Mortgage finances the origination of mortgage loans through various master repurchase agreements, which are recorded in "Financial services" liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The loans are secured by the mortgages held for sale and are repaid when we sell the underlying mortgage loans to permanent investors. As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, we had an aggregate of $58.4 million and $94.3 million, respectively, outstanding under several of K. Hovnanian Mortgage’s short-term borrowing facilities.
See Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of these agreements.
Equity
On September 1, 2022, our Board of Directors terminated our prior repurchase program and authorized a new program for the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our Class A common stock. Under the new repurchase program, repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual dollar amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price, future tax implications and economic and market conditions. The repurchase program may be changed, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date.
During the three months ended January 31, 2023 ,  we repurchased 118,478 shares under the new stock repurchase program, with a market value of $4.8 million, or $40.51 per share, which were added to "Treasury stock" on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2023. There were no shares repurchased during the three months ended January 31, 2022 .  As of January 31, 2023, $33.0 million of our Class A common stock is available to be purchased under the stock repurchase program.
On July 12, 2005, we issued 5,600 shares of 7.625% Series A preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share. Dividends on Series A preferred stock are not cumulative and are payable at an annual rate of 7.625%. The Series A preferred stock is not convertible into the Company’s common stock and is redeemable in whole or in part at our option at the liquidation preference of the shares. The Series A preferred stock is traded as depositary shares, with each depositary share representing 1/1000th of a share of Series A preferred stock. During both the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 we paid dividends of $2.7 million on the Series A preferred stock.

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
We have investments in unconsolidated joint ventures in various markets where our homebuilding operations are located. Investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures increased $26.1 million to $101.0 million at January 31, 2023 compared to October 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to a new joint venture formed in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, along with income recorded from one of our existing unconsolidated joint ventures during the period. As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, we had investments in seven and six unconsolidated homebuilding joint ventures, respectively, and one unconsolidated land development joint venture for both periods. We have no guarantees associated with our unconsolidated joint ventures, other than guarantees limited to performance and completion of development activities, environmental indemnification and standard warranty and representation against fraud, misrepresentation and similar actions, including a voluntary bankruptcy.
Inventories
Total inventory, excluding consolidated inventory not owned, decreased $18.6 million to $1.2 billion at January 31, 2023 compared to October 31, 2022. Total inventory, excluding consolidated inventory not owned, decreased in the Northeast by $54.5 million, partially offset by increases of $17.2 million in the Southeast and $18.7 million in the West. The net decrease was primarily attributable to home deliveries, along with inventory contributed to a new joint venture, partially offset by new land purchases and land development during the period. In the last few years, we have been able to acquire new land parcels at prices that we believe will generate reasonable returns under current homebuilding market conditions. This trend may not continue in either the near or the long term. Substantially all homes under construction or completed and included in inventory at January 31, 2023 are expected to be delivered during the next six to nine months.
Consolidated inventory not owned, which consists of options related to land banking and model financing, increased $6.4 million from October 31, 2022 to January 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in land banking transactions, partially offset by a decrease in the sale and leaseback of certain model homes during the period. We have land banking arrangements, whereby we sell land parcels to land bankers and they provide us an option to purchase finished lots on a predetermined schedule. On our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, at January 31, 2023, inventory of $267.6 million was recorded to “Consolidated inventory not owned,” with a corresponding amount of $160.3 million (net of debt issuance costs) recorded to “Liabilities from inventory not owned” for the amount of net cash received from land banking transactions. We also sell and lease back certain of our model homes with the right to participate in the potential profit when each home is sold to a third-party at the end of the respective lease. On our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, at January 31, 2023, inventory of $47.4 million was recorded to “Consolidated inventory not owned,” with a corresponding amount of $49.3 million (net of debt issuance costs) recorded to “Liabilities from inventory not owned” for the amount of net cash received from sale and leaseback transactions.
We mothball (or stop development on) certain communities when we determine the current performance does not justify further investment at the time. That is, we believe we will generate higher returns if we decide against spending money to improve land today and save the raw land until such time as the markets improve or we determine to sell the property. As of January 31, 2023, we had mothballed land in two communities. The book value associated with these communities included on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in “Land and land options held for future development or sale” at January 31, 2023 was $1.4 million, which was net of impairment charges recorded in prior periods of $20.3 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we did not mothball any additional communities, nor did we sell or re-activate any previously mothballed communities.
Inventories held for sale, which are land parcels where we have decided not to build homes and are actively marketing the land for sale, represented $10.2 million of our total inventories held for sale at January 31, 2023, and are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. There were no inventories held for sale at October 31, 2022. In determining fair value for land held for sale, management considers, among other things, prices for land in recent comparable sale transactions, market analysis studies, which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land (other than in a forced liquidation sale) and recent bona fide offers received from outside third parties.

The following tables summarize home sites included in our total residential real estate. The decrease in total home sites available at January 31, 2023 compared to October 31, 2022 is attributable to delivering homes and terminating certain option agreements during the period, partially offset by acquiring new land parcels.

Active selling communities (which are communities that are open for sale with ten or more home sites available) were 121 at both January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively. This ratio does not include substantially completed communities, which are communities with less than ten home sites available.
Financial Services Assets and Liabilities
Financial services assets decreased $43.2 million to $112.8 million at January 31, 2023, compared to October 31, 2022. Financial services assets consist primarily of residential mortgage receivables held for sale of which $70.9 million and $108.6 million at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively, were being temporarily warehoused and are awaiting sale in the secondary mortgage market. The decrease in mortgage loans held for sale from October 31, 2022 was primarily related to a decrease in the volume of loans originated during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, partially offset by a slight increase in the average loan value.
Financial services liabilities decreased $44.5 million to $91.1 million at January 31, 2023 compared to October 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in amounts outstanding under our mortgage warehouse lines of credit and directly correlates to the decrease in the volume of mortgage loans held for sale during the period.
Inflation
The annual rate of inflation in the United States hit 6.4% in January 2023, nearly the highest in more than three decades, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. Inflation has a long-term effect, because higher costs for land, materials and labor results in increasing sales prices of our homes. Historically, these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in our housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of our homes. A significant risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising house construction costs, including land and interest costs, could substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers and therefore limit our ability to raise home sale prices, which may result in lower gross margins.
Inflation has a lesser short-term effect, because we generally negotiate fixed-price contracts with many, but not all, of our subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of our homes. These prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between three to 12 months. Construction costs for residential buildings represented approximately 57.7% of our homebuilding cost of sales for the three months ended January 31, 2023.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, elevated inflation continues to create economic uncertainty and have an impact on interest rates, which in turn adversely impacted our home sales.
Critical Accounting Policies
As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, our most critical accounting policies relate to inventories, unconsolidated joint ventures, warranty and construction defect reserves and income taxes. Since October 31, 2022, there have been no significant changes to those critical accounting policies.

Safe Harbor Statement
All statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical facts should be considered as “Forward-Looking Statements” within the meaning of the “Safe Harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Item 3.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Substantially all of our long-term debt requires fixed interest payments and we have limited exposure to variable rates. In connection with our mortgage operations, mortgage loans held for sale and the associated mortgage warehouse lines of credit under our Master Repurchase Agreements are subject to interest rate risk; however, such obligations reprice frequently and are short-term in duration. In addition, we hedge the interest rate risk on mortgage loans by obtaining forward commitments from private investors. Accordingly, the interest rate risk from mortgage loans is not significant. We do not use financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk except with respect to mortgage loans. The following table sets forth as of January 31, 2023, our long-term debt obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted-average interest rates and estimated fair value (“FV”).

Item 4.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2023. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to accomplish their objectives.
There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

(1) On September 1, 2022, the Board terminated our prior repurchase program and authorized a new program for the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our Class A common stock. Under the new repurchase program, repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual dollar amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price, future tax implications and economic and market conditions. The repurchase program may be changed, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date.
