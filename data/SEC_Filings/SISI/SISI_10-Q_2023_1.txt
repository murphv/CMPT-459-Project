NOTE

ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Shineco,
Inc. (“Shineco” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on August 20, 1997. The Company is
a holding company whose primary purpose is to develop business opportunities in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”
or “China”).
On
December 30, 2004, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Beijing Tenet-Jove Technological Development Co.,
Ltd. (“Tenet-Jove”), a PRC company, in exchange for restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, and the sole operating
business of the Company became that of its subsidiary, Tenet-Jove. Tenet-Jove was incorporated on December 15, 2003 under the laws of
China. Consequently, Tenet-Jove became a
100 % owned subsidiary of Shineco and was officially granted the status of a wholly foreign-owned
entity by Chinese authorities on July 14, 2006. This transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization. Tenet-Jove owns
90 % interest
of Tianjin Tenet Huatai Technological Development Co., Ltd. (“Tenet Huatai”).
On
December 31, 2008, June 11, 2011, and May 24, 2012, Tenet-Jove entered into a series of contractual agreements including an Executive
Business Cooperation Agreement, a Timely Reporting Agreement, an Equity Interest Pledge Agreement, and an Executive Option Agreement
(collectively, the “VIE Agreements”), with each one of the following entities, Ankang Longevity Pharmaceutical (Group) Co.,
Ltd. (“Ankang Longevity Group”), Yantai Zhisheng International Freight Forwarding Co., Ltd. (“Zhisheng Freight”),
Yantai Zhisheng International Trade Co., Ltd. (“Zhisheng Trade”), Yantai Mouping District Zhisheng Agricultural Produce Cooperative
(“Zhisheng Agricultural”), and Qingdao Zhihesheng Agricultural Produce Services., Ltd. (“Qingdao Zhihesheng”).
On February 24, 2014, Tenet-Jove entered into the same series of contractual agreements with Shineco Zhisheng (Beijing) Bio-Technology
Co., Ltd. (“Zhisheng Bio-Tech”), which was incorporated in 2014. Zhisheng Bio-Tech, Zhisheng Freight, Zhisheng Trade, Zhisheng
Agricultural, and Qingdao Zhihesheng are collectively referred to herein as the “Zhisheng VIEs”.
Pursuant
to the VIE Agreements, Tenet-Jove has the exclusive right to provide to the Zhisheng VIEs and Ankang Longevity Group consulting services
related to their business operations and management. All the above contractual agreements obligate Tenet-Jove to absorb a majority of
the risk of loss from the Zhisheng VIEs and Ankang Longevity Group’s activities and entitle Tenet-Jove to receive a majority of
their residual returns. In essence, Tenet-Jove has become the primary beneficiary of the operations of the Zhisheng VIEs and Ankang Longevity
Group. Therefore, the Zhisheng VIEs and Ankang Longevity Group are treated as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) under the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810 “Consolidation.”
Accordingly, the accounts of these entities are consolidated with those of Tenet-Jove.
Since
Shineco is effectively controlled by the majority shareholders of the Zhisheng VIEs and Ankang Longevity Group, Shineco owns 100% of
Tenet-Jove. Accordingly, Shineco, Tenet-Jove, and the VIEs, the Zhisheng VIEs and Ankang Longevity Group are effectively controlled by
the same majority shareholders. Therefore, Shineco, Tenet-Jove, and the VIEs of Tenet-Jove are considered under common control. The consolidation
of Tenet-Jove and its VIEs into Shineco was accounted for at historical cost and prepared on the basis as if the aforementioned exclusive
contractual agreements between Tenet-Jove and its VIEs had become effective as of the beginning of the first period presented in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.
On
September 30, 2017, Tenet-Jove established Xinjiang Shineco Taihe Agriculture Technology Ltd. (“Xinjiang Taihe”) with registered

(approximately US$ 2.1
million). On December 25, 2016, the Company paid the full amount as the deposit to secure the deal. In May, 2017,
the Company amended the agreement and required Tianjin Tajite to satisfy certain preconditions related to product introductions into
China. On October 26, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition for
51 % of the shares in Tianjin Tajite. On May 5, 2019, two minority

GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES
As
disclosed in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company had recurring net losses of US$ 5,214,831
and US$ 17,127,858 , and continuing cash outflow of US$ 1,786,956
and US$ 5,610,545
from operating activities for the six months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021. Management believes these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern for the next twelve months. In assessing the Company’s going concern, management monitors and analyzes the Company’s
cash on-hand and its ability to generate sufficient revenue sources in the future to support its operating and capital expenditure commitments.
The Company’s liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations.
Direct offering and debt financing have been utilized to finance the working capital requirements of the Company. In addition, the Company’s
shareholders made pledges to provide continuous financial support to the Company whenever the Company has liquidity difficulty for at
least next 12 months from the date of this filing.
Despite
those negative financial trends, as of December 31, 2022, the Company had positive working capital due to the following measurements
the management has taken to enhance the Company’s liquidity:
1)
On
August 11, 2022, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with certain non-US
investors (the “Investors”). Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company will sell to the Investors, up to
1,921,683
shares
of its common stock at a per share purchase price of $ 0.915
for gross proceeds of up to US$ 1,758,340 . As the date of this report,
proceeds amounted to US$ 1.25
million has been received by the Company, and the remaining balance of the proceeds is expected to be
fully collected by March 31, 2023.
2)
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of approximately US$ 16.4
million for the next operating
cycle in next twelve months.
Management
believes that the foregoing measures collectively will provide sufficient liquidity for the Company to meet its future liquidity needs
12 months from the issuance date of this report.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) for interim financial information pursuant to the rules of the SEC and
have been consistently applied. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary
for a fair presentation have been included. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. These financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, which was filed on September 28, 2022.
The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect the principal activities of the Company, its subsidiaries,
its VIEs and its VIEs’ subsidiaries. The non-controlling interest represents the minority shareholders’ interest in the Company’s
majority owned subsidiaries and VIEs. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
8
Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities
VIEs
are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties
or whose equity holders lack adequate decision-making ability. All VIEs and their subsidiaries with which the Company is involved must
be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate
the VIE for financial reporting purposes.
The
total carrying amount of the VIEs and their subsidiaries’ unaudited condensed consolidated assets and liabilities and income information
were as follows:

Non-controlling
Interests
U.S.
GAAP requires that non-controlling interests in subsidiaries and affiliates be reported in the equity section of a company’s balance
sheet. In addition, the amounts attributable to the non-controlling interests in the net income of these entities are reported separately
in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss.
Risks
and Uncertainties
The
operations of the Company are located in the PRC and are subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated
with companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic, and legal
environment and foreign currency exchange. The Company’s results may be adversely affected by changes in the political, regulatory,
and social conditions in the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies or interpretations with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary
measures, currency conversion, remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things. Although the Company has not
experienced losses from these factors and believes that it is in compliance with existing laws and regulations, there is no guarantee
that the Company will continue to do so in the future.
Members
of the current management team own controlling interests in the Company and are also the owners of the VIEs in the PRC. The Company only
has contractual arrangements with the VIEs, which obligate it to absorb the risk of loss and to receive the residual expected returns.
As such, the controlling shareholders of the Company and the VIEs could cancel these agreements or permit them to expire at the end of
the agreement terms, as a result of which the Company would not retain the economic benefits from the VIEs. In addition, should these
agreements be challenged or litigated, they would also be subject to the laws and courts of the PRC legal system, which could make enforcing
the Company’s rights difficult.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting periods. Significant estimates required to be made by management include, but are not limited to, useful lives of property
and equipment, and intangible assets, the recoverability of long-lived assets, and the valuation of accounts receivable, advances to
suppliers, deferred taxes, and inventory reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
10
Revenue
Recognition
We
previously recognized revenue from sales of Luobuma products, Chinese medicinal herbal products, and agricultural products, as well as
providing logistic services and other processing services to external customers. We recognized revenue when all of the following have
occurred: (i) there was persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer; (ii) delivery had occurred or services had been rendered;
(iii) the sales price was fixed or determinable; and (iv) our collection of such fees was reasonably assured. These criteria, as related
to our revenue, were considered to have been met as follows:
Sales
of products:
The Company recognized revenue from the sale of products when the goods were delivered and title to the goods passed
to the customer, provided that there were no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed;
the sales price was fixed or determinable; and collectability was deemed probable.
Revenue
from the provision of services : The Company merely acts as an agent in this type of services transactions. Revenue from domestic
air and overland freight forwarding services was recognized upon the performance of services as stipulated in the underlying contract
or when commodities were being released from the customer’s warehouse; the service price was fixed or determinable; and collectability
was deemed probable.
With
the adoption of ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” revenue is recognized when all of the following five steps
are met: (i) identify the contract(s) with the customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the
transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; (v) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance
obligation is satisfied. The Company adopted the new revenue standard beginning July 1, 2018, and adopted a modified retrospective approach
upon adoption. The Company has assessed the impact of the guidance by reviewing its existing customer contracts to identify differences
that will result from applying the new requirements, including the evaluation of its performance obligations, transaction price, customer
payments, transfer of control, and principal versus agent considerations. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company evaluates whether it
is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. When the Company
is a principal, that the Company obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customers, the
revenues should be recognized in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified goods
or services transferred. When the Company is an agent and its obligation is to facilitate third parties in fulfilling their performance
obligation for specified goods or services, the revenues should be recognized in the net amount for the amount of commission which the
Company earns in exchange for arranging for the specified goods or services to be provided by other parties. Based on the assessment,
the Company concluded that there was no change to the timing and pattern of revenue recognition for its current revenue streams in scope
of Topic 606 and therefore there was no material changes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption of ASC
606.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, cash on deposit, and other highly liquid investments which are unrestricted as to withdrawal
or use, and which have original maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company maintains cash with various financial
institutions mainly in the PRC. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had
no
cash equivalents.
Under
PRC law, it is generally required that a commercial bank in the PRC that holds third-party cash deposits protect the depositors’
rights over and interests in their deposited money. PRC banks are subject to a series of risk control regulatory standards, and PRC bank
regulatory authorities are empowered to take over the operation and management of any PRC bank that faces a material credit crisis. The
Company monitors the banks utilized and has not experienced any problems.
11
Accounts
Receivable, Net
Accounts
receivable are recorded at net realizable value, consisting of the carrying amount less an allowance for uncollectible accounts, as necessary.
The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when there is doubt as to the
collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, the Company considers many
factors, including the age of the balance, the customers’ historical payment history, their current credit-worthiness, and current
economic trends. The fair value of long-term receivables is determined using a present value technique by discounting the future expected
contractual cash flows using current rates at which similar instruments would be issued at the measurement date. As of December 31, 2022
and June 30, 2022, the allowance for doubtful accounts was US$ 7,085,240
and US$ 7,317,236 , respectively. Accounts are written off against
the allowance after efforts at collection prove unsuccessful.
Inventories,
Net
Inventories,
which are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, consist of raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods related
to the Company’s products. Cost is determined using the first in first out (“FIFO”) method. Agricultural products that
the Company farms are recorded at cost, which includes direct costs such as seed selection, fertilizer, labor cost and contract fees
that are spent in growing agricultural products on the leased farmland, and indirect costs which include amortization of prepayments
of farmland leases and farmland development costs. All the costs are accumulated until the time of harvest and then allocated to the
harvested crops costs when they are sold. The Company periodically evaluates its inventory and records an inventory reserve for certain
inventories that may not be saleable or whose cost exceeds net realizable value. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the inventory
reserve was US$ 1,208,807
and US$ 1,249,543 , respectively.
Advances
to Suppliers, Net
Advances
to suppliers consist of payments to suppliers for materials that have not been received. Advances to suppliers are reviewed periodically
to determine whether their carrying value has become impaired. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had an allowance
for uncollectible advances to suppliers of US$ 11,979,135
and US$ 13,544,627 , respectively.
Business
Acquisitions
Business
acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method. The acquisition method requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer,
determine the acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling
interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure goodwill or a bargain gain from the purchase. The acquiree’s results
are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed
are recorded at their fair values on the date acquired and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as
goodwill, or if the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the purchase price consideration, a bargain purchase gain is recorded.
Adjustments to fair value assessments are generally recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer than 12 months). The
acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense
as committed, and requires the Company to recognize and measure certain assets and liabilities, including those arising from contingencies
and contingent consideration in a business combination.
12
Goodwill
Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired. The goodwill impairment test compares the fair value
of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
goodwill of the reporting unit would be considered impaired. To measure the amount of the impairment loss, the implied fair value of
a reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined
in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For each
of these tests, the fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units is determined using a combination of valuation techniques,
including a discounted cash flow methodology. To corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit, a market
approach is utilized using observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded
or which are part of a public or private transaction (to the extent available).
Leases
The
Company follows FASB ASC No. 842,
Leases
(“Topic 842”). The Company leases office spaces, warehouse, and farmland
which are classified as operating leases in accordance with Topic 842. Under Topic 842, lessees are required to recognize the following
for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases, usually with initial term of 12 months or less) on the commencement date: (i)
lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and
(ii) right-of-use (“ROU”) asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of,
a specified asset for the lease term.
Operating
lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over
the lease term at commencement date. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental
borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The operating
lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and includes initial direct costs incurred. The Company’s
lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.
Lease expenses for minimum lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. All operating lease ROU assets
are reviewed for impairment annually. For the six and three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not recognize any
impairment of its ROU assets.
Property
and Equipment, Net
Property
and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for additions, major renewals, and betterments
are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line
basis, less estimated residual value, if any, over an asset’s estimated useful life. Farmland leasehold improvements are amortized
over the shorter of lease term or estimated useful lives of the underlying assets. The estimated useful lives of the Company’s
property and equipment are as follows:
SCHEDULE

Long-lived
Assets
Finite-lived
assets and intangibles are reviewed for impairment testing when circumstances require. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability
of long-lived assets, when undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover an asset’s carrying amount, the asset
is written down to its fair value. The long-lived assets of the Company that are subject to evaluation consist primarily of property
and equipment, land use rights, distribution right, ROU assets and investments. For the six and three months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, the Company did not recognize any impairment of its long-lived assets.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” ASC 820 clarifies the definition of
fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring
fair value as follows:
Level
1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs, other than quoted prices in level, that are observable for the asset or
liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities
in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant
inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level
3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement
of the fair value of the asset or liability.
The
carrying value of financial instruments included in current assets and liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term
nature of these instruments.
Income
Taxes
Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
The
provisions of ASC 740-10-25, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” prescribe a more-likely-than-not threshold for
consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken (or expected to be taken) in a tax return. This
ASC also provides guidance on the recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax
assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and related disclosures. The Company did
not have any uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. The Company had not provided deferred taxes for undistributed
earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries at December 31, 2022, as it is the Company’s policy to indefinitely reinvest these earnings in
non-U.S. operations. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable.
The
statute of limitations for the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns and certain state income tax returns remains open for
tax year 2019 and thereafter. As of December 31, 2022, the tax years ended December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2022 for the Company’s
PRC subsidiaries remained open for statutory examination by PRC tax authorities.
14
On
December 22, 2017, the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (“The Act”) was enacted. Under the provisions of The Act, the
U.S. corporate tax rate decreased from
35 % to
21 %. As the Company has a June 30 fiscal year end, the lower corporate income tax rate
was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 28% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and 21% for subsequent
fiscal years. Additionally, The Act imposes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries,
and future foreign earnings are subject to U.S. taxation. The change in rate caused the Company to re-measure its income tax liability
and record an estimated income tax expense of US$ 744,766
for the year ended June 30, 2018. On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 118 (“SAB 118”) was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the
necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain
income tax effects of The Act. In accordance with SAB 118, additional work is necessary to do a more detailed analysis of The Act as
well as potential correlative adjustments. Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in fiscal
2019 when the analysis is complete.
The Company elects to pay the transition tax over an eight-year period using specified percentages
(eight percent per year for the first five years, 15 percent in year six, 20 percent in year seven, and 25 percent in year eight) .
Value-Added
Tax
Sales
revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of a value-added tax (“VAT”).
Before May 1, 2018, all of the Company’s
products that were sold in the PRC were subject to a Chinese value-added tax at a rate of 17% of the gross sales price. After May 1,
2018, the Company was subject a tax rate of 16%, and after April 1, 2019, the tax rate was further reduced to 13% based on the new Chinese
tax law . This VAT may be offset by VAT paid by the Company on raw materials and other materials included in the cost of producing finished
products or acquiring finished products. The Company records a VAT payable or VAT receivable in the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.
Foreign
Currency Translation
The
Company uses the United States dollar (“U.S. dollars,” “USD,” or “US$”) for financial reporting purposes.
The Company’s subsidiaries and VIEs maintain their books and records in their functional currency of Renminbi (“RMB”),
the currency of the PRC.
In
general, for consolidation purposes, the Company translates the assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries and VIEs into U.S. dollars
using the applicable exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date, and the statements of income and cash flows are translated
at average exchange rates during the reporting periods. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement
of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet. Equity accounts are translated
at historical rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements of the subsidiaries and VIEs are recorded
as accumulated other comprehensive loss.
The
balance sheet amounts, with the exception of equity, at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 were translated at
1
RMB to
0.1450
USD and
at
1
RMB to
0.1493
USD, respectively. The average translation rates applied to the income and cash flow statement amounts for the six
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were
1
RMB to
0.1433
USD and
1
RMB to
0.1555
USD, respectively. The average translation rates
applied to income and cash flow statement amounts for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were
1
RMB to
0.1406
USD and
1
RMB to
0.1564
USD, respectively.
Convertible
Notes Payable
In
accordance with ASC 470
Debt with conversion and other option , an embedded beneficial conversion feature present in a convertible
instrument shall be recognized separately at issuance by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature
to additional paid-in capital. Issuance costs should be allocated proportionally to the debt host and conversion feature. Deferred financing
costs will be discounted and amortized subsequently, and the convertible notes are subsequently carried at amortized cost.
15
Comprehensive
Loss
Comprehensive
loss consists of two components, net loss and other comprehensive income (loss). The foreign currency translation gain or loss resulting
from translation of the financial statements expressed in RMB to USD is reported in other comprehensive income (loss) in the unaudited
condensed consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss.
Equity
Investment
An
investment in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not have a controlling interest, is accounted
for using the equity method. Significant influence is generally considered to exist when the Company has an ownership interest in the
voting stock between
20 % and
50 %, and other factors, such as representation on the board of directors, voting rights, and the impact
of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate.
Loss
per Share
The
Company computes loss per share (“EPS”) in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share” (“ASC 260”).
ASC 260 requires companies with complex capital structures to present basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as net loss divided
by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but presents the dilutive effect
on a per share basis of potential common shares (e.g., outstanding convertible securities, options, and warrants) as if they had been
converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Potential common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect
(i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. There is no
anti-dilutive effect for the six and three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
The
following table presents a reconciliation of basic and diluted loss per share for the six and three months ended December 31, 2022 and
2021:

New
Accounting Pronouncements
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected
credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and
supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial
assets measured at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 was subsequently amended by Accounting Standards Update 2018-19,
Codification Improvements
to Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses,
Accounting Standards Update 2019-04
Codification Improvements to Topic
326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments , and Accounting
Standards Update 2019-05,
Targeted Transition Relief.
For public entities, ASU 2016-13 and its amendments are effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. For all other entities, this guidance and its
amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early application will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2018. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives
and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2019-10”). ASU 2019-10 (i) provides a framework to stagger effective
dates for future major accounting standards and (ii) amends the effective dates for certain major new accounting standards to give implementation
relief to certain types of entities. Specifically, ASU 2019-10 changes some effective dates for certain new standards on the following
topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC): (a) Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815) – now effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021; (b) Leases (ASC 842) - now
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021;
(c) Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (ASC 326) - now effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including
interim periods within those fiscal years; and (d) Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (ASC 350) - now effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company plans to adopt this guidance effective
July 1, 2023 and the adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on its financial statements.
In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The FASB is issuing
this Update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards (the “Simplification Initiative”). The
objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of GAAP for which cost and complexity can be reduced
while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The specific areas of potential
simplification in this ASU were submitted by stakeholders as part of the Simplification Initiative. For public business entities, the
amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020.
The Company adopted this ASU on July 1, 2021 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on its financial statements.
The
Company believes that other recent accounting pronouncement updates will not have a material effect on the Company’s unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements.

DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS
The
Company acquired distribution rights to distribute branded products of Daiso 100-yen shops through the acquisition of Tianjin Tajite.
As this distribution right is difficult to acquire and will contribute significant revenue to Tianjin Tajite, such distribution rights
were identified and valued as an intangible asset in the acquisition of Tianjin Tajite. The distribution rights, which have no expiration
date, have been determined to have an indefinite life. Since the distribution rights have an indefinite life, the Company will evaluate
them for impairment at least annually or earlier if determined necessary. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the management performed
evaluation on the impairment of distribution rights. As the Company is unable to generate any revenue and profit from the distribution
right due to the unfavorable policy of China Customs and current business environment caused by the continuous impact from the COVID-19,
the management fully recorded an impairment loss on distribution rights of Tianjin Tajite.

INVESTMENTS
Guangyuan
entered into an equity investment agreement with Shanxi Pharmaceutical Group Yushe Pharmaceutical Development Co., Ltd. (“Yushe
Pharmaceutical”), a Chinese pharmaceutical enterprise to invest a total of RMB
2.0
million (approximately US$ 0.3
million) for a
20 %
equity interest in Yushe Pharmaceutical. The investment is accounted for using the equity method because Guangyuan has significant

LEASES
The
Company leases offices space and warehouse under non-cancelable operating leases, with terms ranging from one to six years. In addition,
the Zhisheng VIEs and Guangyuan entered into several farmland lease contracts with farmer cooperatives to lease farmland in order to
plant and grow organic vegetables, fruit, and Chinese yew trees, fast-growing bamboo willows and scenic greening trees. The lease terms
vary from
3
years to
24
years. The Company considers those renewal or termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised
in the determination of the lease term and initial measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities. Lease expenses for lease payment
are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with initial terms of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance
sheet.
When
available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value; however, most of the Company’s
leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company discounts lease payments based on an estimate of its
incremental borrowing rate. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive
covenants.
The
table below presents the operating lease related assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheets.

the Company’s Zhisheng VIEs, has not been able to grow and cultivate green agricultural produce on its leased farmland, and based
on the management estimation, these farmlands are unlikely to generate enough future profit and cashflow. Therefore, the Company decided

ACQUISITION
Acquisition
of Tianjin Taijite
On
December 12, 2016, the Company entered into a merger and acquisition agreement with Tianjin Tajite, a professional e-commerce company
distributing Luobuma fabric commodities and branded products of Daiso 100-yen shops, based in Tianjin, China, to acquire
51 %
equity interests
in Tianjin Tajite. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company made a payment of RMB 14,000,000
(approximately US$ 2.1
million) at the end of
December 2016 as the total consideration for the acquisition of Tianjin Tajite. On October 26, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition
of Tianjin Tajite. The acquisition provides a unique opportunity for the Company to enter the market of Luobuma fabric commodities and
branded products of Daiso 100-yen shops.
The
transaction was accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC 805-10, Business Combinations. The Company retained independent
appraisers to advise management in the determination of the fair value of the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The values
assigned in these financial statements represents management’s best estimate of fair values as of the acquisition date.
23
As
required by ASC 805-20, Business Combinations—Identifiable Assets and Liabilities, and Any Non-controlling Interest, management
conducted a review to reassess whether they identified all the assets acquired and all the liabilities assumed, and followed ASC 805-20’s
measurement procedures for recognition of the fair value of net assets acquired.
The
excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair value of assets acquired was allocated to goodwill which amounted to RMB 14,010,195
(approximately US$ 2.1
million). The results of operations of Tianjin Tajite have been included in the consolidated statements of operations
from the date of acquisition.
In
June 2018, the management performed evaluation on the impairment of goodwill. Due to the lower than expected revenue and profit, and
unfavorable business environment, the management fully recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of Tianjin Tajite.
On
May 5, 2019, two minority shareholders of Tianjin Tajite transferred
26.4 %
of the equity interest hold to the Company. There was no consideration
paid for the transfers, and after the transfers, the Company owns
77.4 %
equity interest of Tianjin Tajite.
During
the year ended June 30, 2022, the management performed evaluation on the impairment of distribution rights. As the Company is unable
to generate any revenue and profit from the distribution right due to the unfavorable policy of China Customs and current business environment
caused by the continuous impact from the COVID-19, the management fully recorded an impairment loss on distribution rights of Tianjin
Tajite. (Note 9)
Under
ASC 805-10, acquisition-related costs (i.e., advisory, legal, valuation, and other professional fees) are not included as a component
of consideration transferred, but are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred.

(“Guangyuan”)’s Shareholders in exchange for Guangyuan Shareholders entering into the VIE agreements with Tenet-Jove,
which composes of one group of similar identifiable assets; (ii) Tenet-Jove entered a Termination Agreement with Ankang Longevity and
the Ankang Shareholders; (iii) as a consideration to the Restructuring Agreement and based on a valuation report on the equity interests
of Guangyuan issued by an independent third party, Tenet-Jove relinquished all of its rights and interests in Ankang Longevity and transferred
those rights and interests to the Guangyuan Shareholders; and (iv) Guangyuan and the Guangyuan Shareholders entered into a series of
variable interest entity agreements with Tenet-Jove. After signing of the Restructuring Agreement, the Company and the shareholders of
Ankang and Guangyuan actively carried out the transferring of rights and interests in Ankang and Guangyuan, and the transferring was

through its subsidiary Tenet-Jove, completed the previously announced acquisition pursuant to the Restructuring Agreement dated June
8, 2021.
24
The
management determined that July 5, 2021 was the acquisition date of Guangyuan. The acquisition provides a unique opportunity for the
Company to enter the market of planting fast-growing bamboo willows and scenic greening trees.
The
transaction was accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC 805-10, Business Combinations. The Company retained independent
appraisers to advise management in the determination of the fair value of the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The values
assigned in these financial statements represent management’s best estimate of fair values as of the Acquisition Date.

TAXES
(a)
Corporate Income Taxes
The
Company is subject to income taxes on an entity basis on income arising in or derived from the location in which each entity is domiciled.
Shineco
is incorporated in the United States and has no operating activities. Tenet-Jove and the VIEs are governed by the Income Tax Laws of
the PRC, and are currently subject to tax at a statutory rate of
25 % on taxable income. Two VIEs and Xinjiang Taihe receive a full income
tax exemption from the local tax authority of the PRC as agricultural enterprises as long as the favorable tax policy remains unchanged.
On
December 22, 2017, The Act was enacted. The Act imposes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign
subsidiaries, and future foreign earnings are subject to U.S. taxation. The change in rate has caused the Company to re-measure its income
tax liability and record an estimated income tax expense of US$ 744,766
for the year ended June 30, 2018. In accordance with SAB 118,
additional work is necessary to do a more detailed analysis of The Act as well as potential correlative adjustments. Any subsequent adjustment
to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in fiscal 2019 when the analysis is complete.
The Company elects to pay the
transition tax over an eight-year period using specified percentages (eight percent per year for the first five years, 15 percent in
year six, 20 percent in year seven, and 25 percent in year eight).

Value-Added Tax
The
Company is subject to a VAT for selling merchandise.
The applicable VAT rate was 17% before May 1, 2018 for products sold in the PRC
and decreased to 16% thereafter, and after April 1, 2019, the tax rate was further reduced to 13% based on the new Chinese tax law. The
amount of VAT liability is determined by applying the applicable tax rate to the invoiced amount of goods sold (output VAT) less VAT
paid on purchases made with the relevant supporting invoices (input VAT). Under commercial practice in the PRC, the Company pays VAT
based on tax invoices issued.
The tax invoices may be issued subsequent to the date on which revenue is recognized, and there may be
a considerable delay between the date on which the revenue is recognized and the date on which the tax invoice is issued.
In
the event that the PRC tax authorities dispute the date on which revenue is recognized for tax purposes, the PRC tax office has the right
to assess a penalty based on the amount of the taxes which are determined to be late or deficient, and the penalty will be expensed in
the period if and when a determination is made by the tax authorities. There were
no
assessed penalties during the six and three months
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Legal
Contingencies
On
May 16, 2017, Mrs. Guiqin Li (the “Plaintiff”) commenced a lawsuit against the Company in the People’s Court of Chongqing
Pilot Free Trade Zone of China. Plaintiff alleged that due to the misguidance given by the Company’s security trading department,
the Plaintiff did not manage to complete the sales of the Company’s common stock on the day of the Company’s initial public
offering in the United States. As the price of the Company’s common stock continued falling after initial public offering, the
Plaintiff incurred losses and hence seek money damages against the Company. Based on the judgment of the first trail, the Company was
required to pay the Plaintiff a settlement payment, including the money compensation, interests and other legal fees. In January 2023,
the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release (the “Agreement”) with the Plaintiff, pursuant to which the Company
paid the Plaintiff a total sum of US$ 700,645
(approximately RMB
4.8
million) as settlement payment, and upon acceptance of the settlement
payment from the Company, the Plaintiff waived, released, and forever discharged the Company from all past and future claims. As the
date of this report, the Company has paid the Plaintiff a total sum of US$ 110,000
according to the Agreement.
On
November 26, 2021, the Company filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County against Lei Zhang and
Yan Li, as defendants, and Transhare Corporation, as a nominal defendant, asserting that defendants had not paid for restricted shares
of the Company stock pursuant to stock purchase agreements they executed with the Company. The Company is seeking money damages of $ 9,088,125.00
plus interest, punitive damages, and reimbursement of all costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees. In December, defendants filed an
answer and counterclaims against the Company, which they amended on January 27, 2022 after the Company moved to dismiss their counterclaims.
They claimed that the Company made false and materially misleading statements, specifically regarding the sale of the shares and the
removal of their restrictive legends. Defendants seek a declaratory judgment, indemnification, and monetary damages of at least $ 9
million,
punitive damages of $ 10
million, plus interest, costs, and fees. In April 2022, the Court granted the Company’s motion for a preliminary
injunction to restrain the Company’s transfer agent from removing the restrictive legends on the shares, provided that the Company
posts a bond in the amount of US$ 1.5
million by May 20, 2022, which the Company declined to do. On June 13, 2022, the restriction imposed
on the shares were lifted.
The
Company moved to dismiss the counterclaims, and its motion was fully submitted in April 2022. On September 9, 2022, the Court granted
the Company’s motion to dismiss defendants’ counterclaims on all but three counterclaims. Defendants’ outstanding counterclaims
are for breach of contract, conversion, and wrongful refusal to remove restrictions pursuant to 6 Del. C. § 8-401.
Nominal
defendant Transhare Corporation moved to dismiss the defendants’ counterclaim against it for wrongful refusal to remove restrictions
pursuant to 6 Del. C. § 8-401, and its motion was fully submitted in April 2022. On September 9, 2022, the Court granted Transhare
Corporation’s motion to dismiss defendants’ counterclaim for wrongful refusal to remove restrictions. Defendants have appealed
the Court’s September 9, 2022 order dismissing defendants’ counterclaim for wrongful refusal to remove restrictions. On October
3, 2022 the parties submitted a stipulation dismissing defendants’ outstanding counterclaim against Transhare Corporation seeking
declaratory judgment.
Trial
is currently scheduled for September 18, 2023. The outcome of this legal proceeding is uncertain at this point. The Company intends to
recover on its claims, and vigorously defend itself in this litigation.  As of December 31, 2022, the total unpaid shares issued
to Lei Zhang and Yan Li by the Company was

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Forward-Looking
Statements
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), and is subject to the safe harbor created by those sections. All statements other than statements of historical fact are
“forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks
and uncertainties, such as statements about our plans, objectives, expectations, assumptions or future events. In some cases, you can
identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,”
“continuing,” “ongoing,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “may,”
“should,” “will,” “could,” and similar expressions denoting uncertainty or an action that may, will
or is expected to occur in the future. These statements involve estimates, assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied
by the forward-looking statements.
Examples
of forward-looking statements include:
●
the
timing of the development of future products;
●
projections
of revenue, earnings, capital structure, and other financial items;
●
local,
regional, national, and global Luobuma and herbal medicines price fluctuations;
●
statements
of our plans and objectives, including those that relate to our proposed expansions and the effect such expansions may have on our
revenue;
●
statements
regarding the capabilities of our business operations;
●
statements
of expected future economic performance;
●
the
impact of the COVID-19 outbreak;
●
statements
regarding competition in our market; and
●
assumptions
underlying statements regarding us or our business.
The
ultimate correctness of these forward-looking statements depends upon a number of known and unknown risks and events. When reviewing
the discussion below, you should keep in mind the substantial risks and uncertainties that impact our business. In particular, we encourage
you to review the risks and uncertainties described in “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2022 filed with the SEC on September 28, 2022 (the “Annual Report”) and other SEC filings. These risks and
uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our forward-looking statements contained
in this report. In addition, many factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our
forward-looking statements. Consequently, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
The
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation
to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect
the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which
any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Nonetheless, we reserve the right to make such updates from time to time by press release, periodic report, or other method of public
disclosure without the need for specific reference to this
Quarterly Report . No such update
shall be deemed to indicate that other statements not addressed by such update is incorrect or create an obligation to provide any other
updates.

The
information included in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read
in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes included in this Quarterly Report, and the
audited consolidated financial statements and notes and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations contained in our Annual Report. All monetary figures are presented in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated.
General
Overview
Shineco,
Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Delaware. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct a substantial
majority of our operations through the operating entities established in the People’s Republic of China, or the PRC, primarily
the variable interest entities (the “VIEs”). We do not have any equity ownership of the VIEs, instead we are entitled to
receive the economic benefits of the VIEs’ business operations through certain contractual arrangements. Our common stock that
currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Markets are shares of our Delaware holding company that maintains service agreements with the
associated operating companies. The Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our structure, which could result in a material change
in our operations and the value of our securities could decline or become worthless.
We
use our subsidiaries and the VIEs’ vertically and horizontally integrated production, distribution, and sales channels to provide
health and well-being focused plant-based products. Our products are only sold domestically in China. We utilize modern engineering technologies
and biotechnologies to produce, among other products, Chinese herbal medicines, organic agricultural produce, and specialized textiles.
Our health and well-being focused plant-based products business is divided into three major segments:
Processing
and distributing traditional Chinese herbal medicine products as well as other pharmaceutical products
- This segment is conducted
through Ankang Longevity Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (“Ankang Longevity Group”), a Chinese company formerly under contractual
arrangement with the Company which operates 66 cooperative retail pharmacies throughout Ankang, a city in southern Shaanxi province,
China, through which we sell directly to individual customers traditional Chinese medicinal products produced by us as well as by third
parties. Ankang Longevity Group also owns a factory specializing in decoction, which is the process by which solid materials are heated
or boiled in order to extract liquids, and distributes decoction products to wholesalers and pharmaceutical companies around China.
On
June 8, 2021, Tenet-Jove entered into a Restructuring Agreement with various parties. Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement,
(i) the Company transferred all of its rights and interests in Ankang Longevity Group to Yushe County Guangyuan Forest Development Co.,
Ltd. (“Guangyuan”)’s Shareholders in exchange for the Guangyuan Shareholders entering into VIE agreements with Tenet-Jove,
which composes of one group of similar identifiable assets; (ii) Tenet-Jove entered a Termination Agreement with Ankang Longevity Group
and the Ankang Longevity Group Shareholders; (iii) as a consideration to the Restructuring Agreement and based on a valuation report
on the equity interests of Guangyuan issued by an independent third party, Tenet-Jove relinquished all of its rights and interests in
Ankang Longevity Group and transferred those rights and interests to the Guangyuan Shareholders; and (iv) Guangyuan and the Guangyuan
Shareholders entered into a series of variable interest entity agreements with Tenet-Jove. After signing of the Restructuring Agreement,
the Company and the shareholders of Ankang Longevity Group and Guangyuan actively carried out the transferring of rights and interests
in Ankang Longevity Group and Guangyuan, and the transferring was completed subsequently on July 5, 2021. Afterwards, with the completion
of all other follow-ups works, on August 16, 2021, the Company, through its subsidiary Tenet-Jove, completed the previously announced
acquisition pursuant to the Restructuring Agreement dated June 8, 2021. The management determined that July 5, 2021 was the disposal
date of Ankang Longevity Group. The results of operations of Ankang Longevity Group have been reclassified to “net loss from discontinued
operations” in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss for the six and three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021.
39
Processing
and distributing green and organic agricultural produce as well as growing and cultivating yew trees (taxus media)
- We currently
cultivate and sell yew mainly to group and corporate customers, but do not currently process yew into Chinese or Western medicines. This
segment is conducted through the VIEs: Qingdao Zhihesheng Agricultural Produce Services, Ltd (“Qingdao Zhihesheng”). Meanwhile,
we entered the market of planting fast-growing bamboo willows and scenic greening trees through the newly acquired VIE, Yushe County
Guangyuan Forest Development Co., Ltd. (“Guangyuan”). The operations of this segment are located in the North regions of
Mainland China, mostly carried out in Shanxi Province.
Providing
domestic air and overland freight forwarding services
- We currently provide domestic air and overland freight forwarding services
by outsourcing these services to a third party. This segment is conducted through our VIE, Yantai Zhisheng International Freight Forwarding
Co., Ltd (“Zhisheng Freight”).
Developing
and distributing specialized fabrics, textiles, and other byproducts derived from an indigenous Chinese plant Apocynum Venetum, grown
in the Xinjiang region of China, and known in Chinese as “Luobuma” or “bluish dogbane”
- Our Luobuma
products are specialized textile and health supplement products designed to incorporate traditional Eastern medicines with modern scientific
methods. These products are predicated on centuries-old traditions of Eastern herbal remedies derived from the Luobuma raw material.
This segment is channeled through our directly-owned subsidiary, Beijing Tenet-Jove Technological Development Co., Ltd. (“Tenet-Jove”),
and its 90% subsidiary Tianjin Tenet Huatai Technological Development Co., Ltd. (“Tenet Huatai”).

Factors
Affecting Financial Performance
We
believe that the following factors will affect our financial performance:
Increasing
demand for our products
– We believe that the increasing demand for our agricultural products will have a positive impact
on our financial position. We plan to develop new products and expand our distribution network as well as to grow our business through
possible mergers and acquisitions of similar or synergetic businesses, all aimed at increasing awareness of our brand, developing customer
loyalty, meeting customer demands in various markets and providing solid foundations for our growth. As of the date of this
Quarterly
Report , however, we do not have any agreements, undertakings or understandings to acquire any such entities and there can be no
guarantee that we ever will.
Maintaining
effective control of our costs and expenses
- Successful cost control depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain adequate
material supplies as required by our operations at competitive prices. We will focus on improving our long-term cost control strategies
including establishing long-term alliances with certain suppliers to ensure adequate supply is maintained. We will carry forward the
economies of scale and advantages from our nationwide distribution network and diversified offerings. Moreover, we will step up our efforts
in higher value-added products of Luobuma by using an exclusive and patented technology, to optimize quality management, procurement
processes and cost control, and give full play to the strong production capacity and trustworthy sales teams to maximize our profit and
bring better long-term return for our stockholders.
41
Economic
and Political Risks
Our
operations are conducted primarily in the PRC and subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with
companies operating in North America and/or Western Europe. These include risks with, among others, the political, economic and legal
environment and foreign currency exchange. Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the political and social conditions in
the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversions,
remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.
COVID-19
Impact
The
COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in the implementation of significant governmental measures, including lockdowns, closures, quarantines,
and travel bans, intended to control the spread of the virus. In accordance with the epidemic control measures imposed by the local governments
related to COVID-19, our offices and retail stores remained closed or had limited business operations after the Chinese New Year holiday
until early April 2020. In addition, COVID-19 had caused severe disruptions in transportation, limited access to our facilities and limited
support from workforce employed in our operations, and as a result, we experienced delays or the inability to delivery our products to
customers on a timely basis. Further, some of our customers or suppliers experienced financial distress, delayed or defaults on payment,
sharp diminishing of business, or suffer disruptions in their business due to the outbreak. Any decreased collectability of accounts
receivable, delayed raw materials supply, bankruptcy of small and medium businesses, or early termination of agreements due to deterioration
in economic conditions could negatively impact our results of operations. Wider-spread COVID-19 in China and globally could prolong the
deterioration in economic conditions and could cause decreases in or delays in spending and reduce and/or negatively impact our short-term
ability to grow our revenue.
Due
to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China, our headquarter in Beijing was closed down on April 25, 2022 and only resumed our business
in mid-June 2022. Meanwhile, the business of our subsidiaries and VIEs was also negatively affected during this period, including but
not limited to the execution of our sales contract and fulfillment of customer orders and the collection of the payments from customers
in a timely manner. The resurgence of COVID-19 impact on our operating results and financial performance seems to be temporary, we will
continue to monitor and modify the operating strategies in response to the COVID-19. In early December 2022, China announced a nationwide
loosening of its zero-covid policy, and the country faced a wave in infections after the lifting of these restrictions. The extent of the future impact of COVID-19 is still highly uncertain and
cannot be predicted as of the date our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are released.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires
the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity
and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and that have a material
impact on financial condition or operating performance. While we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other
factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements require significant judgments and estimates. For additional information relating to these and other accounting policies,
see Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report.
42
Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities
VIEs
are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties
or whose equity holders lack adequate decision-making ability. All VIEs and their subsidiaries with which the Company is involved must
be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate
the VIE for financial reporting purposes.
Use
of Estimates
Significant
estimates required to be made by management include, but are not limited to, useful lives of property and equipment, and intangible assets,
the recoverability of long-lived assets and the valuation of accounts receivable,
advances to suppliers,
deferred taxes and inventory reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Accounts
Receivable, Net
Accounts
receivable are recorded at net realizable value consisting of the carrying amount less an allowance for uncollectible accounts, as necessary.
We review the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability
of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, we consider many factors, including the age
of the balance, the customers’ historical payment history, their current credit-worthiness and current economic trends. The fair
value of long-term receivables is determined using a present value technique by discounting the future expected contractual cash flows
using current rates at which similar instruments would be issued at the measurement date.
As of
December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the allowance for doubtful accounts was US$7,085,240 and US$7,317,236, respectively. Accounts are
written off against the allowance after efforts at collection prove unsuccessful.
Inventories,
Net
Inventories,
which are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, consist of raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods related
to our products. Cost is determined using the first in first out method. Agricultural products that we farm are recorded at cost, which
includes direct costs such as seed selection, fertilizer, labor cost, and contract fees that are spent in growing agricultural products
on the leased farmland, and indirect costs such as amortization of prepayments of farmland leases and farmland development costs. All
the costs are accumulated until the time of harvest and then allocated to the harvested crops costs when they are sold. We periodically
evaluate our inventory and records an inventory reserve for certain inventories that may not be saleable or whose cost exceeds net realizable
value.
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the inventory reserve was US$1,208,807 and US$1,249,543,
respectively.
Revenue
Recognition
We
previously recognized revenue from sales of Luobuma products, Chinese medicinal herbal products, and agricultural products, as well as
providing logistic services and other processing services to external customers. We recognized revenue when all of the following have
occurred: (i) there was persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer; (ii) delivery had occurred or services had been rendered;
(iii) the sales price was fixed or determinable; and (iv) our collection of such fees was reasonably assured. These criteria, as related
to our revenue, were considered to have been met as follows:
Sales
of products: We recognized revenue from the sale of products when the goods were delivered and title to the goods passed to the customer
provided that there were no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed; the sales price
was fixed or determinable; and collectability was deemed probable.
43
Revenue
from provision of services: The Company merely acts as an agent in this type of services transactions. Revenue from domestic air and
overland freight forwarding services was recognized upon the performance of services as stipulated in the underlying contract or when
commodities were being released from the customer’s warehouse; the service price was fixed or determinable; and collectability
was deemed probable.
With
the adoption of ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” revenue is recognized when all of the following five steps
are met: (i) identify the contract(s) with the customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the
transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; (v) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance
obligation is satisfied. The Company adopted the new revenue standard beginning July 1, 2018, and adopted a modified retrospective approach
upon adoption. The Company has assessed the impact of the guidance by reviewing its existing customer contracts to identify differences
that will result from applying the new requirements, including the evaluation of its performance obligations, transaction price, customer
payments, transfer of control, and principal versus agent considerations. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company evaluates whether it
is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. When the Company
is a principal, that the Company obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customers, the
revenues should be recognized in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified goods
or services transferred. When the Company is an agent and its obligation is to facilitate third parties in fulfilling their performance
obligation for specified goods or services, the revenues should be recognized in the net amount for the amount of commission which the
Company earns in exchange for arranging for the specified goods or services to be provided by other parties. Based on the assessment,
the Company concluded that there was no change to the timing and pattern of revenue recognition for its current revenue streams in scope
of Topic 606 and therefore there was no material changes to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
upon adoption of ASC 606.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
We
follow the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value,
prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value
as follows:
Level
1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs, other than quoted prices in level, that are observable for the asset or
liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities
in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant
inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level
3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement
of the fair value of the asset or liability.
The
carrying value of financial instruments included in current assets and liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term
nature of these instruments.

Revenue
Currently,
we, through our PRC subsidiaries and the VIEs, have three revenue streams derived from our three major business segments from continuing
operations. First, developing, manufacturing, and distributing specialized fabrics, textiles, and other by-products derived from an indigenous
Chinese plant Apocynum Venetum, known in Chinese as “Luobuma” or “Bluish Dogbane,” as well as Luoboma raw materials
processing; this segment is channeled through our wholly owned subsidiary, Tenet-Jove. Second, planting, processing and distributing
green and organic agricultural produce, growing and cultivation of yew trees, as well as planting fast-growing bamboo willows and scenic
greening trees; this segment is conducted through Qingdao Zhihesheng and Guangyuan. Third, providing domestic air and overland freight
forwarding services by outsourcing these services to a third party; this segment is conducted through Zhisheng Freight. For the business
segment, that processing and distributing traditional Chinese medicinal herbal products as well as other pharmaceutical products; this
segment is conducted via the VIE, Ankang Longevity Group and its subsidiaries, which was disposed and did not generate any sales during
the six months ended December 31, 2021.

For
the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, revenue from sales of Luobuma products was US$19,222 and US$34,768, respectively, which
represented a decrease of US$15,546, or 44.71%. The decrease of revenue from this segment was mainly due to the decrease in revenue from
Tenet-Jove and Tenet Huatai. The low revenue from sales of Luobuma products is because we did not launch any new products and reduced
our resources and investments in our E-commerce distribution channel, and currently, we mainly focused on clearing off our remaining
old stocks. Hence, revenue from this segment continued falling during the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same
period in 2021.
For
the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, revenue from sales of other agricultural products was US$823,685 and US$875,191, respectively,
representing a decrease of US$51,506, or 5.89%. Since our sales of yew trees were adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, we modified
our operating strategies in response to the pandemic. Instead of selling more unmatured yew trees, we are now cultivating more matured
yew trees, which can be used to extract Taxol, a more valuable chemical substance which is used experimentally as a drug in the treatment
of cancer.
For
the six months ended
December 31 , 2022 and 2021, revenue from provision of freight services
was US$232,038 and US$452,373, respectively, representing a decrease of US$220,335, or 48.71%. The decrease was mainly due to we outsourced
our
domestic and international logistic services to third-party logistic companies due to the change
in our business strategies. Since we merely served as an agent in this type of transactions, our revenue from domestic and international
logistic services was recognized in the net amount during the
six months ended
December
31, 2022.

to less stock written off during the six months ended December 31, 2022. Due to the continuous impact of Covid-19 in China, which resulted
in the damage and death of a large number of yew trees, we continued writing off a large amount of our inventory during the six months

General
and Administrative Expenses
For
the
six months ended December 31 ,
2022, our general and administrative expenses were US$ 4,203,856,
representing a decrease
of US$ 6,302,610 , or
59.99 %, as compared to
the same period in 2021. The decrease was mainly due to the deceased bad debt expense during the
six months ended December 31 ,
2022, as we recorded a significant amount of bad debt expense as a result of the impact from COVID-19 during the same period last year.
We recorded allowance according to our accounting policy based on our best estimates. Management will continue putting effort in collection
of overdue receivables and utilize our advances to our vendors. The decrease was also due to decreased professional service fees in relation
to the Company’s issuance of common stock and convertible notes and decreased compensation expenses in relation to the Company’s
lawsuit. The decrease was partially offset by the increased intermediary fee paid to a third party as commission for the Company intended
acquisition as well as the increased stock compensation expenses incurred during the
six months ended December 31 ,
2022.
Impairment
Loss of Distribution Rights
For
the six months ended December 31 , 2022 and 2021 , our impairment loss of distribution right
was US$ nil and US$1,140,551, respectively. We acquired distribution rights to distribute branded products of Daiso 100-yen shops through
the acquisition of Tianjin Tajite. During the six months ended December 31 , 2021 , the management
performed evaluation on the impairment of distribution rights. As the Company is unable to generate any revenue and profit from the distribution
right due to the unfavorable policy of China Customs and current business environment caused by the continuous impact from the COVID-19,
the management fully recorded an impairment loss on distribution rights of Tianjin Tajite.
Impairment
Loss on An Unconsolidated Entity
For
the six months ended December 31, 2021, our impairment loss on an unconsolidated entity was US$149,790. The management performed evaluation
on the impairment of the investment make on Shanxi Pharmaceutical Group Yushe Pharmaceutical Development Co., Ltd., (“Yushe Pharmaceutical”)
and considered it is unlikely to obtain any investment income in the future, hence, the management fully recorded impairment loss
on this investment.
Loss
from Equity Method Investments
Our
VIE, Guangyuan has a 20% equity interest in Shanxi Pharmaceutical Group Yushe Pharmaceutical Development Co., Ltd. (“Yushe Pharmaceutical”).
We recorded a loss of US$16,153 for the six months ended
December
31 , 2021 from this investment. As we fully impaired the investment subsequently, no income or loss
was recorded for the six months ended
December 31 , 2022 from this investment.
On
August 31, 2021, we entered into a capital injection agreement with the other shareholders of Shanghai Gaojing Private Fund Management
(“Gaojing Private Fund”), a Chinese private fund management company, to complete the injection of a total RMB 4.8 million
(approximately US$0.70 million) for its 32% equity interest in Gaojing Private Fund. We recorded a loss of US$ 6,221
and
US$90,835
for the
six months ended
December
31, 2022 and 2021 from this investment, respectively. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to lower net loss generated by the equity
investment company in the current period.
Amortization
of Debt Issuance Costs
For
the
six months ended
December 31, 2022, our amortization of debt issuance costs expenses
was US$355,972, representing a decrease of US$498,346, or 58.33%, as compared to amortization of debt issuance costs expenses of US$854,318,
in the same period in 2021. We entered into four convertible note agreements and two of them was fully converted, hence, resulted in
a decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs expenses for the
six months ended
December
31, 2022 as compared to the same period last year.

Interest
Income (Expenses), Net
For

an increase of US$515,383, or 767.64%, as compared to net interest income was US$67,139 in the same period in 2021. The increase in net
interest expenses was attributable to the increased interest expenses on loans borrowed from third parties. The increase was also due
to less interest income generated from loans to third parties and related parties during the
six
months ended
December 31, 2022 as some of the loans have been fully collected.
Net
Loss from Continuing Operations
Our
net loss from continuing operations was US$5,214,831 for the
six months ended
December 31,
2022, a decrease of US$8,777,790, or 62.73%, from net loss from continuing operations of US$13,992,621 for the
six
months ended
December 31, 2021. The decrease in net loss was primarily a result of the decrease in general and administrative
expenses, impairment loss of distribution rights and amortization of debt issuance costs.
Net
Loss from Discontinued Operations
As
mentioned above, after signing of the Restructuring Agreement on June 8, 2021, we and the shareholders of Ankang Longevity Group and
Guangyuan actively carried out the transferring of rights and interests in Ankang Longevity Group and Guangyuan, and the transferring
was completed subsequently on July 5, 2021, and the management determined that July 5, 2021 was the disposal date of Ankang Longevity
Group. We had a total net loss from discontinued operations of US$3,135,237 for the
six months
ended
December 31, 2021.
Net
Loss
Our
net loss was US$5,214,831 for the
six months ended
December 31, 2022, a decrease of US$11,913,027
or 69.55%, from a net loss of US$17,127,858 for the same period in 2021. The decrease in net loss was primarily a result of the decreased
net loss from continuing operations, as well as the decreased net loss from discontinued operations as mentioned above.
Comprehensive
Loss
The
comprehensive loss was US$6,371,142 for the
six months ended
December 31, 2022, a decrease
of US$9,942,410 from a comprehensive loss of US$16,313,552 for the same period in 2021. After deduction of non-controlling interest,
the comprehensive loss attributable to us was US$6,377,429 for the
six months ended
December
31, 2022, compared to a comprehensive loss attributable to us in the amount of US$16,317,063 for the
six
months ended
December 31, 2021. The decrease of comprehensive loss was due to the decrease in net loss as mentioned above,
which
was partially offset by the decrease in the recorded income of foreign currency translation where the financial statements denominated
in RMB were translated to the USD denomination.

operations. First, developing, manufacturing, and distributing specialized fabrics, textiles, and other by-products derived from an indigenous

was US$13,648 and US$21,260, respectively, which represented a slight decrease of US$7,612, or 35.80%. The decrease of revenue from this
segment was mainly due to the decrease in revenue from Tenet-Jove and Tenet Huatai. The low revenue from sales of Luobuma products is
because we did not launch any new products and reduced our resources and investments in our E-commerce distribution channel, and currently,
we mainly focused on clearing off our remaining old stocks. Hence, revenue from this segment continued falling during the three months
ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021.

General
and Administrative Expenses
For
the
three months ended December 31 ,
2022, our general and administrative expenses were US$ 2,317,413,
representing an increase
of US$ 384,603 , or
19.90 %, as compared to the
same period in 2021. The increase was mainly due to the increased bad debt expense during the
three months ended December 31 ,
2022, as we recorded a significant amount of bad debt expense as a result of the impact from COVID-19 during the last quarter of year
2022. We recorded allowance according to our accounting policy based on our best estimates. Management will continue putting effort in
collection of overdue receivables and utilize our advances to our vendors. The increase was partially offset by the decreased professional
service fees in relation to the Company’s issuance of common stock and decreased compensation expenses in relation to the Company’s
lawsuit during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Impairment
Loss on An Unconsolidated Entity
For
the three months ended December 31, 2021, our impairment loss on an unconsolidated entity was US$149,790. The management performed evaluation
on the impairment of the investment make on Shanxi Pharmaceutical Group Yushe Pharmaceutical Development Co., Ltd., (“Yushe Pharmaceutical”)
and considered it’s unlikely to obtain any investment income in the future, hence, the management fully recorded impairment loss
on this investment.
Income
(Loss) from Equity Method Investments
Our
VIE, Guangyuan has a 20% equity interest in Shanxi Pharmaceutical Group Yushe Pharmaceutical Development Co., Ltd. (“Yushe Pharmaceutical”).
We recorded a loss of US$11,967 for the three months ended
December
31 , 2021 from this investment. As we fully impaired the investment subsequently, no income or loss
was recorded for the three months ended
December 31 , 2022 from this investment.
On
August 31, 2021, we entered into a capital injection agreement with the other shareholders of Shanghai Gaojing Private Fund Management
(“Gaojing Private Fund”), a Chinese private fund management company, to complete the injection of a total RMB 4.8 million
(approximately US$0.70 million) for its 32% equity interest in Gaojing Private Fund. We recorded an income of US$83 and a loss of
US$67,101
for the
three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021 from this investment, respectively.
The decrease in net loss was primarily due to lower net loss generated by the equity investment company in the current period.
Amortization
of Debt Issuance Costs
For
the
three	 months ended
December 31, 2022, our amortization of debt issuance costs expenses
was US$201,569, representing a decrease of US$193,771, or 49.01%, as compared to amortization of debt issuance costs expenses of US$395,340,
in the same period in 2021. We entered into four convertible note agreements and two of them was fully converted, hence, resulted in
a decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs expenses for the

31, 2022 as compared to the same period last year.
Interest
Income (Expenses), Net
For
the
three months ended

an increase of US$379,655, or 159.96%, as compared to net interest income was US$237,338 in the same period in 2021. The increase in
net interest expenses mainly due to less interest income generated from loans to third parties and related parties during the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022 as some of the loans have been fully collected.
53
Net
Loss
Our
net loss was US$2,772,511 for the three
months ended
December 31, 2022, a decrease of US$118,367,
or 3.88%, from net loss of US$2,884,400 for the
three months ended
December 31, 2021. The
decrease in net loss was primarily a result of the decrease in gross loss and amortization of debt issuance costs, which was partially
offset by the increased general and administrative expenses and interest expenses.
Comprehensive
Loss
The
comprehensive loss was US$1,647,484 for the
three months ended
December 31, 2022, a decrease
of US$423,180 from a comprehensive loss of US$2,070,664 for the same period in 2021. After deduction of non-controlling interest, the
comprehensive loss attributable to us was US$1,633,023 for the
three months ended
December
31, 2022, compared to a comprehensive loss attributable to us in the amount of US$2,058,096 for the
three
months ended
December 31, 2021. The decrease of comprehensive loss was due to the decrease in net loss as mentioned above,
as
well as an increase in the recorded income of foreign currency translation where the financial statements denominated in RMB were translated
to the USD denomination.
Treasury
Policies
We
have established treasury policies with the objectives of achieving effective control of treasury operations and of lowering cost of
funds. Therefore, funding for all operations and foreign exchange exposure have been centrally reviewed and monitored from the top level.
To manage our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates on specific transactions and foreign currency borrowings,
currency structured instruments and other appropriate financial instruments will be used to hedge material exposure, if any.
Our
policy precludes us from entering into any derivative contracts purely for speculative activities. Through our treasury policies, we
aim to:
(a)
Minimize interest risk
This
is accomplished by loan re-financing and negotiation. We will continue to closely monitor the total loan portfolio and compare the loan
margin spread under our existing agreements against the current borrowing interest rates under different currencies and new offers from
banks.
(b)
Minimize currency risk
In
view of the current volatile currency market, we will closely monitor the foreign currency borrowings at the company level. As of December
31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, except the above-mentioned convertible note, we did not engage in any foreign currency borrowings or loan
contracts.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources

On
May 16, 2017, Mrs. Guiqin Li (the “Plaintiff”) commenced a lawsuit against us in the People’s Court of Chongqing Pilot
Free Trade Zone of China. Plaintiff alleged that due to the misguidance given by our security trading department, the Plaintiff did not
manage to complete the sales of our common stock on the day of our initial public offering in the United States. As the price of our
common stock continued falling after initial public offering, the Plaintiff incurred losses and hence seek money damages against us.

and other legal fees.
In January 2023, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release
(the “Agreement”) with the Plaintiff, pursuant to which the Company paid the Plaintiff a total sum of US$700,645 (approximately

plus interest, punitive damages, and reimbursement of all costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees. In December, defendants filed an
answer and counterclaims against the Company, which they amended on January 27, 2022 after the Company moved to dismiss their counterclaims.

removal of their restrictive legends. Defendants seek a declaratory judgment, indemnification, and monetary damages of at least $9 million,

As

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a)
Evaluation of Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that the information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based
on our review, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report due
to following material weaknesses:
●
a
lack of full-time U.S. GAAP personnel in the accounting department to monitor the recording of the transactions; and
●
a
lack of segregation of duties for accounting personnel who prepared and reviewed the journal entries.
In
order to address the above material weaknesses, our management has taken the following steps:
●
recruiting
sufficient qualified professionals with appropriate levels of knowledge and experience to assist in reviewing and resolving accounting
issues in routine or complex transactions. To mitigate the reporting risks, we engaged an outside professional consulting firm to
supplement our efforts to improve our internal control over financial reporting;
●
improving
the communication between management, board of directors, and the Chief Financial Officer; and
●
obtaining
proper approval for other significant and non-routine transactions from the board of directors.
We
are committed to monitoring the effectiveness of these measures and making any changes that are necessary and appropriate.
(b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022. Because of its inherent limitations,
a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system
contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.
