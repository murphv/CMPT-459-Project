NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 1.
Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of Cavco Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "we," "us," "our," the "Company" or "Cavco") have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In addition, references throughout to numbered "Notes" refer to these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, unless otherwise stated. In the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, that are necessary to fairly state the results for the periods presented. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified from secured financings to Accrued expenses and other current liabilities to conform to current period classification. We have evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC; and except for the events set forth in Note 23, there were no subsequent events requiring disclosure. These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 2, 2022, filed with the SEC ("Form 10-K"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Due to uncertainties, actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results or cash flows for the full year. The Company operates on a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest to March 31 st
of each year. Each fiscal quarter consists of 13 weeks, with an occasional fourth quarter extending to 14 weeks, if necessary, for the fiscal year to end on the Saturday nearest to March 31 st . The current fiscal year will end on April 1, 2023 and will include 52 weeks. We operate in
two
segments: (1) factory-built housing, which includes wholesale and retail factory-built housing operations, and (2) financial services, which includes manufactured housing consumer finance and insurance. We design and build a wide variety of affordable manufactured homes, modular homes and park model RVs through
27
homebuilding production lines located throughout the United States, which are sold to a network of independent distributors, community operators and residential developers and through our
42
Company-owned retail stores. The financial services segment is comprised of a finance subsidiary, CountryPlace Acceptance Corp. ("CountryPlace"), and an insurance subsidiary, Standard Casualty Company ("Standard Casualty"). CountryPlace is an approved Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") seller/servicer and a Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae") mortgage-backed securities issuer that offers conforming mortgages, non-conforming mortgages and home-only loans to purchasers of factory-built homes. Standard Casualty provides property and casualty insurance primarily to owners of manufactured homes.
During fiscal 2022, we acquired an additional
20 % ownership in Craftsman Homes, LLC and Craftsman Homes Development, LLC (collectively known as "Craftsman"), which gave us a
70 % majority controlling ownership and therefore became a consolidated entity. We also purchased certain manufactured housing assets and assumed certain liabilities of The Commodore Corporation ("Commodore"). Craftsman is a manufactured home retailer with four locations in Nevada selling Company and other manufacturer branded homes. Commodore added six manufacturing facilities and two wholly-owned retail locations, and also participates in commercial lending operations with its dealers. In addition to the below, for a description of significant accounting policies we used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Form 10-K. 4 Table of Contents 2.

Debt On
November 22, 2022 , we entered into a Credit Agreement among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer, and the guarantors party thereto (the "Credit Agreement"), providing for a $ 50.0  million revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% (as adjusted, "Term SOFR"), plus the "applicable rate" or (ii) the "base rate" (defined as the highest of (a) the Bank of America prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, and (c) Term SOFR plus 1.00%) plus the "applicable rate." The applicable rate will be determined in accordance with a pricing grid based on the Company's Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) ranging from 1.125% to 1.350% per annum for Term SOFR rate loans and from 0.125% to 0.350% per annum for base rate loans.
In addition, the Company will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility of
0.15 % per annum. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants (including restrictions, subject to customary exceptions, qualifications, and baskets, on the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees of indebtedness, pay dividends or distributions on, redeem, repurchase, or retire capital stock, make investments, loans, advances, or acquisitions, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, engage in transactions with affiliates, create liens, transfer, or sell assets, create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts from their subsidiaries, and consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole), and events of default (as defined in the Credit Agreement). In addition, the Credit Agreement includes the following financial covenants (i) as of the end of any fiscal quarter, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) cannot exceed 3.25 to 1.00 and (ii) a requirement to maintain Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for any period of four fiscal quarters of at least $75 million. As of December 31, 2022, there were
no
borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and we were in compliance with all covenants. 15.
Reinsurance and Insurance Loss Reserves Certain of Standard Casualty's premiums and benefits are assumed from and ceded to other insurance companies under various reinsurance agreements. We remain obligated for amounts ceded in the event that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations. 15 Table of Contents The effects of reinsurance on premiums written and earned were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Written Earned Written Earned Direct premiums $ 7,454   $ 7,529   $ 6,380   $ 6,557   Assumed premiums—nonaffiliated 7,709   8,358   7,023   7,822   Ceded premiums—nonaffiliated ( 4,413 ) ( 4,413 ) ( 3,866 ) ( 3,866 ) $ 10,750   $ 11,474   $ 9,537   $ 10,513   Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Written Earned Written Earned Direct premiums $ 22,350   $ 21,917   $ 19,529   $ 18,876   Assumed premiums—nonaffiliated 25,555   24,526   23,837   22,830   Ceded premiums—nonaffiliated ( 13,056 ) ( 13,056 ) ( 11,227 ) ( 11,227 ) $ 34,849   $ 33,387   $ 32,139   $ 30,479   Typical insurance policies written or assumed have a maximum coverage of $ 300,000
per claim, of which we cede $ 125,000
of the risk of loss per reinsurance. Therefore, our risk of loss is limited to $ 175,000
per claim on typical policies, subject to the reinsurers meeting their obligations. After this limit, amounts are recoverable through reinsurance for catastrophic losses in excess of $ 2
million per occurrence, up to a maximum of $ 70
million in the aggregate for that occurrence. Standard Casualty establishes reserves for claims and claims expense on reported and incurred but not reported ("IBNR") claims of non-reinsured losses. Reserves for claims are included in the Accrued expenses and other current liabilities line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and claims expenses are recorded in Cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The following details the activity in the reserve
for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and
January 1, 2022 (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Balance at beginning of period $ 7,790   $ 7,350   $ 8,149   $ 7,451   Net incurred losses during the period 8,464   5,046   25,050   20,303   Net claim payments during the period ( 7,163 ) ( 4,916 ) ( 24,108 ) ( 20,274 ) Balance at end of period $ 9,091   $ 7,480   $ 9,091   $ 7,480   16.
Income Taxes For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, Income tax (expense) benefit included $ 2.4  million and $ 5.1  million, respectively, of estimated tax credits related to the manufacture and sale of energy efficient homes. This credit was initially established under the Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 and most recently extended in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. The three and nine months ended January 1, 2022 included $ 34.4  million of such credits, which included catch up credits for homes sold between 2018 through 2021, and resulted in a net Income tax benefit of $ 20.7  million and $ 0.9  million, respectively. 16 Table of Contents 17.
Commitments and Contingencies Repurchase Contingencies . We are contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with financial institutions providing inventory financing to independent distributors of our products. These arrangements, which are customary in the industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to distributors in the event of default by the distributor. The maximum amount for which the Company was liable under such agreements approximated $ 193.5  million and $ 141.0  million
at December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, respectively, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. We
had a reserve for repurchase commitments of $ 4.9
million at December 31, 2022 and $ 3.6
million at April 2, 2022, and there were
no
repurchases during either period. Construction-Period Mortgages.
We fund construction-period mortgages through periodic advances during home construction. At the time of initial funding, we commit to fully fund the loan contract in accordance with a predetermined schedule. The total loan contract amount, less cumulative advances, represents an off-balance sheet contingent commitment to fund future advances. Loan contracts with off-balance sheet commitments are summarized below (in thousands): December 31, 2022 April 2, 2022 Construction loan contract amount $ 3,251   $ 9,330   Cumulative advances ( 757 ) ( 3,547 ) $ 2,494   $ 5,783   Representations and Warranties of Mortgages Sold .
We sell loans to Government-Sponsored Enterprises ("GSEs") and whole-loan purchasers. In connection with these activities, we provide representations and warranties related to the loans sold or financed.
Upon a breach of a representation, we may be required to repurch ase the loan or to indemnify a party for incurred losses. We maintain a reserve for these contingent repurchase and indemnification obliga tions. This reserve of $ 819,000
as of December 31, 2022 and $ 866,000
as of April 2, 2022, included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, reflects management's estimate of probable loss. There were
no
claim requests that resulted in the repurchase of a loan during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. Interest Rate Lock Commitments . In originating loans for sale, we issue interest rate lock commitments ("IRLCs") to prospective borrowers. These IRLCs bind us to fund the approved loan at the specified rate regardless of whether interest rates or market prices for similar loans have changed between the commitment date and the closing date. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding IRLCs with a notional amount of $ 41.0
million. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized gains of $ 12,000
on outstandin g IRLCs. There were
no
gains or losses on outstanding IRLCs for the three months ended January 1, 2022. For the
nine months ended
December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, we recognized gains of $ 43,000
and $ 42,000 , respectively. Forward Sales Commitments . We manage the risk profiles of a portion of the outstanding IRLCs and mortgage loans held for sale by entering into forward sales of mortgage-backed securities and whole loan sale commitments (collectively "Commitments"). As of December 31, 2022, we had $ 3.9
million in outstanding Commitments. We recognized non-cash losses
of $ 197,000
and $ 61,000
during the
three months ended December 31, 2022
and
January 1, 2022 , respectively . During the
nine months ended
December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, we recognized losses of $ 282,000
and $ 329,000 , respectively. 17 Table of Contents Legal Matters.
We are party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. Based on management's present knowledge of the facts and (in certain cases) advice of outside counsel, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations after taking into account any existing reserves, which reserves are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, future events or circumstances that may currently be unknown to management will determine whether the resolution of pending or threatened litigation or claims will ultimately have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations in any future reporting periods. 18.

Subsequent Event As announced on
January 3, 2023
in a current report on Form 8-K, we completed the acquisition of Solitaire Inc. and other related entities (collectively "Solitaire Homes"), including their
four
manufacturing facilities and
twenty-two
retail locations. The addition of Solitaire Homes to our existing manufacturing and retail system strengthens our position in the Southwest and expands our manufacturing capabilities into Mexico. The purchase price totaled $ 93  million, before certain customary adjustments, and was funded with cash on hand. The allocation of the purchase price is still preliminary as of the date of this report and will be finalized upon completion of the analysis of the fair values of the acquired assets, liabilities assumed and intangible assets. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date. Accordingly, supplemental pro-forma information is not available and is therefore omitted. 21 Table of Contents Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements Statements in this Report on Form 10-Q ("Report") include "forward-looking statements," within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are often characterized by the use of words such as "believes," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "may," "will," "intends," "plans," or "anticipates," or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions.

Forward-looking statements contained in this Report speak only as of the date of this Report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document. We do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this Report or in any document incorporated herein by reference to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, except as required by law. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond our control. To the extent that our assumptions and expectations differ from actual results, our ability to meet such forward-looking statements, including the ability to generate positive cash flow from operations, may be significantly hindered. Factors that could affect our results and cause them to materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation, those discussed under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Form 10-K"). Introduction The following should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes that appear in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. References to "Note" or "Notes" pertain to the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Company Overview Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, we design and produce factory-built housing products primarily distributed through a network of independent and Company-owned retailers, planned community operators and residential developers. We are one of the largest producers of manufactured homes in the United States, based on reported wholesale shipments. Our products are marketed under a variety of brand names including Cavco, Fleetwood, Palm Harbor, Nationwide, Fairmont, Friendship, Chariot Eagle, Destiny, Commodore, Colony, Pennwest, R-Anell, Manorwood, MidCountry and Solitaire. We are also a leading producer of park model RVs, vacation cabins and factory-built commercial structures. Our finance subsidiary, CountryPlace Acceptance Corp. ("CountryPlace"), is an approved Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") seller/servicer and a Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae") mortgage-backed securities issuer that offers conforming mortgages, non-conforming mortgages and home-only loans to purchasers of factory-built homes. Our insurance subsidiary, Standard Casualty Company ("Standard Casualty"), provides property and casualty insurance to owners of manufactured homes. 22 Table of Contents We operate 31 homebuilding production lines in Millersburg and Woodburn, Oregon; Riverside, California; Nampa, Idaho; Phoenix, Glendale and Goodyear, Arizona; Deming, New Mexico; Duncan, Oklahoma; Austin, Fort Worth, Seguin and Waco, Texas; Montevideo, Minnesota; Dorchester, Wisconsin; Nappanee and Goshen, Indiana; Lafayette, Tennessee; Douglas and Moultrie, Georgia; Shippenville and Emlenton, Pennsylvania; Martinsville and Rocky Mount, Virginia; Cherryville and Hamlet, North Carolina; Ocala and Plant City, Florida; and two in Ojinaga, Mexico. The majority of the homes produced are sold to, and distributed by, independently owned retail operations located throughout the United States and Canada. In addition, our homes are sold through 64 Company-owned U.S. retail locations, including the 22 retail locations acquired with Solitaire Homes. During fiscal 2022, we acquired an additional 20% ownership in Craftsman Homes, LLC and Craftsman Homes Development, LLC (collectively known as "Craftsman"), which gave us a 70% majority controlling interest. Craftsman is a manufactured home retailer with four locations in Nevada selling Company and other manufacturer branded homes. We also purchased certain manufactured housing assets and assumed certain liabilities of The Commodore Corporation ("Commodore"). Commodore added six manufacturing facilities and two wholly-owned retail locations, and also participates in commercial lending operations with its dealers. On January 3, 2023, subsequent to the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2023, we completed the acquisition of Solitaire Homes, including its four manufacturing facilities, twenty-two retail locations and its dedicated transportation operations. The addition of Solitaire Homes to our existing manufacturing and retail system strengthens our position in the Southwest and expands our manufacturing capabilities into Mexico. Company and Industry Outlook According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute, industry home shipments through November 2022 were 106,454, an increase of 8.9% compared to 97,745 shipments in the same period last year.
The industry offers solutions to the affordable housing crisis and these shipment numbers reflect the industry's ability to produce in the current environment. The average price per square foot for a manufactured home is usually lower than a site-built home. Also, based on the comparatively low cost associated with manufactured home ownership, our products have traditionally competed with rental housing's monthly payment affordability. The two largest manufactured housing consumer demographics, young adults and those who are age 55 and older, are both growing. " First-time" and "move-up" buyers of affordable homes are historically among the largest segments of new manufactured home purchasers. Included in this group are lower-income households that are particularly affected by periods of low employment rates and underemployment. Consumer confidence is especially important among manufactured home buyers interested in our products for seasonal or retirement living. We employ a concerted effort to identify niche market opportunities where our diverse product lines and custom building capabilities provide us with a competitive advantage. We are focused on building quality, energy efficient homes for the modern home buyer. Our green building initiatives involve the creation of an energy efficient envelope resulting in lower utility costs, as well as the higher utilization of renewable materials in our manufacturing process. We also build homes designed to use alternative energy sources, such as solar.
We maintain a conservative cost structure in an effort to build added value into our homes and we work diligently to maintain a solid financial position. Our balance sheet strength, including the position in cash and cash equivalents, helps avoid liquidity problems and enables us to act effectively as market opportunities or challenges present themselves. We continue to make certain commercial loan programs available to members of our wholesale distribution chain. Under direct commercial loan arrangements, we provide funds for financed home purchases by distributors, community operators and residential developers (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Our involvement in commercial lending helps to increase the availability of manufactured home financing to distributors, community operators and residential developers and provides additional opportunities for product exposure to potential home buyers. While these initiatives support our ongoing efforts to expand product distribution, they also expose us to risks associated with the creditworthiness of this customer base and our inventory financing partners. 23 Table of Contents The lack of an efficient secondary market for manufactured home-only loans and the limited number of institutions providing such loans results in higher borrowing costs for home-only loans and continues to constrain industry growth. We work independently and with other industry participants to develop secondary market opportunities for manufactured home-only loan and non-conforming mortgage portfolios and expand lending availability in the industry. Additionally, we continue to invest in community-based lending initiatives that provide home-only financing to residents of certain manufactured home communities. We also develop and invest in home-only lending programs to grow sales of homes through traditional distribution points. We believe that growing our investment and participation in home-only lending may provide additional sales growth opportunities for our factory-built housing operations and reduce our exposure to the actions of independent lenders. Key housing building materials include wood, wood products, steel, gypsum wallboard, windows, doors fiberglass insulation, carpet, vinyl, fasteners, plumbing materials, aluminum, appliances and electrical items . Fluctuations in the cost of materials and labor may affect gross margins from home sales to the extent that costs cannot be efficiently matched to the home sal es price. Pricing and availability of certain raw materials have been volatile due to a number of factors in the current environment. We continue to monitor and react to inflation in these materials by maintaining a focus on our product pricing in response to higher materials costs, but such product pricing increases may lag behind the escalation of such costs. From time to time and to varying degrees, we may experience shortages in the availability of materials and/or labor in the markets served. Availability of these inputs has not caused significant production halts in the current period, but we have experienced periodic shutdowns in other periods and shortages of primary building materials have caused production inefficiencies as we have needed to change processes in response to the delay in materials. These shortages may also result in extended order backlogs, delays in the delivery of homes and reduced gross margins from home sales. Our
backlog at December 31, 2022 was
$427 million compared to $651 million last quarter, a decrease of $224 million or 34.4%, and down $678 million, or 61.4%, compared to $1.1 billion at January 1, 2022. This was largely due to lower home order rates net of cancellations. Order rates are down from the extreme highs we saw during the summer of 2020 to the summer of 2021. While it is difficult to predict the future of housing demand, employee availability, supply chain and Company performance and operations, maintaining an appropriately sized and well-trained workforce is key to meeting demand. We continually review the wage rates of our production employees and have established other monetary incentive and benefit programs, with a goal of providing competitive compensation. We are also working to more extensively use web-based recruiting tools, update our recruitment brochures and improve the appearance and appeal of our manufacturing facilities to improve the recruitment and retention of qualified production employees and reduce annualized turnover rates. In the financial services segment, we continue to assist customers in need by servicing existing loans and insurance policies and complying with state and federal regulations regarding loan forbearance, home foreclosures and policy cancellations. Certain loans serviced for investors expose us to cash flow deficits if customers do not make contractual monthly payments of principal and interest in a
timely manner. For certain loans serviced for Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac, and home-only loans serviced for certain other investors, we must remit scheduled monthly principal and/or interest payments and principal curtailments regardless of whether monthly mortgage payments are collected from borrowers. Ginnie Mae permits cash obligations on loans in forbearance from COVID-19 to be offset by other incoming cash flows from loans such as loan pre-payments. Monthly collections of principal and interest from borrowers have exceeded scheduled principal and interest payments owed to investors; however, mandatory extended forbearance under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act and certain other regulations related to COVID-19 could negatively impact cash obligations in the future. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Revenue Three Months Ended ($ in thousands, except revenue per home sold) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Change Factory-built housing $ 481,193  $ 413,590  $ 67,603  16.3  % Financial services 19,410  18,124  1,286  7.1  % $ 500,603  $ 431,714  $ 68,889  16.0  % Factory-built homes sold by Company-owned retail sales centers 748  658  90 13.7  % to independent retailers, builders, communities and developers 3,694  3,766  (72) (1.9) % 4,442  4,424  18  0.4  % Net factory-built housing revenue per home sold $ 108,328  $ 93,488  $ 14,840  15.9  %   Nine Months Ended  ($ in thousands, except revenue per home sold) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Change Factory-built housing $ 1,613,392  $ 1,067,967  $ 545,425  51.1  % Financial services 52,941  53,712  (771) (1.4) % $ 1,666,333  $ 1,121,679  $ 544,654  48.6  % Factory-built homes sold by Company-owned retail sales centers 2,481  2,091  390 18.7  % to independent retailers, builders, communities and developers 12,418  9,630  2,788  29.0  % 14,899  11,721  3,178  27.1  % Net factory-built housing revenue per home sold $ 108,289  $ 91,116  $ 17,173  18.8  % In factory-built housing, Net revenue for both the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased compared to the respective periods in the prior year due to higher home sales volume and higher home selling prices. Also included in both current year periods is $3.9 million of home sales revenue from an equity method joint venture. This represents revenue that was previously deferred and now recognized in the third quarter upon that entity selling those homes to an unrelated third party. Net factory-built housing revenue per home sold is a volatile metric dependent upon several factors. A primary factor is the price disparity between sales of homes to independent distributors, builders, communities and developers and sales of homes to consumers by Company-owned retail stores. Wholesale sales prices are primarily comprised of the home and the cost to ship the home from a homebuilding facility to the home-site. Retail home prices include these items and retail markup, as well as items that are largely subject to home buyer discretion, including, but not limited to, installation, utility connections, site improvements, landscaping and additional services. Our h omes are constructed in one or more floor sections ("modules") which are then installed on the customer's site. Changes in the number of modules per home, the selection of different home types/models and optional home upgrades create changes in product mix, also causing fluctuations in this metric. The tables below presents the mix of modules and homes sold for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022: 25 Table of Contents Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Change Modules Homes Modules Homes Modules Homes U.S. Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") code homes 5,852  3,454  6,166  3,583  (5.1) % (3.6) % Modular homes 1,412  708  1,270  632  11.2  % 12.0  % Park model RVs 280  280  209  209  34.0  % 34.0  % 7,544  4,442  7,645  4,424  (1.3) % 0.4  % Nine Months Ended   December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Change Modules Homes Modules Homes Modules Homes HUD code homes 20,474  11,925  17,366  10,013  17.9  % 19.1  % Modular homes 4,408  2,207  2,257  1,112  95.3  % 98.5  % Park model RVs 767  767  596  596  28.7  % 28.7  % 25,649  14,899  20,219  11,721  26.9  % 27.1  % For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Financial services segment Net revenue increased 7.1% primarily due to more policies in force in the current period, partially offset by lower interest income earned on the acquired consumer loan portfolios. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, Net revenue decreased 1.4% primarily due to realized and unrealized losses on marketable equity securities in the insurance subsidiary's portfolio during such period, lower interest income earned on the acquired consumer loan portfolios and lower volume in home loan sales. These items were partially offset by more insurance policies in force in the current period compared to the prior period. 26 Table of Contents Gross Profit Three Months Ended ($ in thousands) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Change Factory-built housing $ 122,923  $ 104,119  $ 18,804  18.1  % Financial services 9,045  11,089  (2,044) (18.4) % $ 131,968  $ 115,208  $ 16,760  14.5  % Gross profit as % of Net revenue Consolidated 26.4  % 26.7  % N/A (0.3) % Factory-built housing 25.5  % 25.2  % N/A 0.3  % Financial services 46.6  % 61.2  % N/A (14.6) %   Nine Months Ended ($ in thousands) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Change Factory-built housing $ 412,174  $ 252,691  $ 159,483  63.1  % Financial services 22,117  26,458  (4,341) (16.4) % $ 434,291  $ 279,149  $ 155,142  55.6  % Gross profit as % of Net revenue Consolidated 26.1  % 24.9  % N/A 1.2  % Factory-built housing 25.5  % 23.7  % N/A 1.8  % Financial services 41.8  % 49.3  % N/A (7.5) % Factory-built housing Gross profit and Gross profit percentage increased for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to higher average sales prices. In Financial services, Gross profit and Gross profit percentage decreased for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to higher insurance claims from Arizona and Texas weather related events and greater unrealized losses on marketable equity securities compared to the same period last year. 27 Table of Contents

For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily from higher legal and professional fees and higher salary and incentive compensation expense on improved earnings. As a percentage of Net revenue, Selling, general and administrative expenses improved by 220 and 160 basis points for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, from better utilization of fixed costs on higher sales. 28 Table of Contents Other Components of Net Income Three Months Ended ($ in thousands) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Change Interest expense $ 216  $ 209  $ 7  3.3  % Other income, net 3,233  4,258  (1,025) 24  % Income tax (expense) benefit (16,492) 20,680  (37,172) 179.7  % Effective tax rate 21.7  % (35.1) % N/A N/M   Nine Months Ended ($ in thousands) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Change Interest expense $ 610  $ 576  $ 34  5.9  % Other income, net 6,455  11,387  (4,932) 43.3  % Income tax (expense) benefit (54,721) 910  (55,631) 6,113.3  % Effective tax rate 22.0  % (0.6) % N/A N/M Interest expense consists primarily of interest related to finance leases. Other income, net primarily consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses on corporate investments, interest income related to commercial loan receivable balances, interest income earned on cash balances and gains and losses from the sale of property, plant and equipment. The decrease in Other income, net is primarily due to a $3.3 million gain recognized in the second quarter of last year on the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of Craftsman upon acquisition of a controlling interest. Additionally, for the
nine months ended December 31, 2022,
we recognized a $1.2 million unrealized loss on corporate marketable investments compared to a $4.0 million unrealized gain in the prior year. These items were partially offset by higher interest income earned on a larger cash balance held in high yield money market funds. For the three and nine months ended January 1, 2022, the effective income tax rate was a benefit due to $34.4 million of energy efficient home tax credits, which included catch up credits for homes sold between 2018 through 2021. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was 21.7% and 22.0%, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022, together with cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations, cover our obligations and provide for growth for the next 12 months and into the foreseeable future. We maintain cash in U.S. Treasury and other money market funds, some of which are in excess of federally insured limits. We expect to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions of, or strategic investments in, businesses that are complementary to the Company, as well as other expansion opportunities. Such transactions may require the use of cash and have other impacts on our liquidity and capital resources. We have sufficient liquid resources including our recently implemented $50.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, of which no amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2022. Regardless, depending on our operating results and strategic opportunities, we may choose to seek additional or alternative sources of financing in the future. There can be no assurance that such financing would be available on satisfactory terms, if at all. If this financing were not available, it could be necessary for us to reevaluate our long-term operating plans to make more efficient use of our existing capital resources at such time. The exact nature of any changes to our plans that would be considered depends on various factors, such as conditions in the factory-built housing industry and general economic conditions outside of our control. 29 Table of Contents State insurance regulations restrict the amount of dividends that can be paid to stockholders of insurance companies. As a result, the assets owned by our insurance subsidiary are generally not available to satisfy the claims of Cavco or its legal subsidiaries. We believe that stockholders' equity at the insurance subsidiary remains sufficient and do not believe that the ability to pay ordinary dividends to Cavco at anticipated levels will be restricted per state regulations. The following is a summary of the Company's cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively: Nine Months Ended (in thousands) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 $ Change Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of the fiscal year $ 259,334  $ 339,307  $ (79,973) Net cash provided by operating activities 230,119  125,967  104,152  Net cash used in investing activities (29,199) (147,842) 118,643  Net cash used in financing activities (73,860) (34,290) (39,570) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of the period $ 386,394  $ 283,142  $ 103,252  Net cash provided by operating activities increased primarily from higher net income adjusted for non-cash items. This increase was partially offset by increased lending in our Financial Services segment, as well as under our commercial loan programs. Consumer loan originations increased $12.7 million to $135.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 from $122.9 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2022, which was partially offset by increased proceeds of
$3.6 million
from sales of consumer loans. Net cash used in investing activities consists of buying and selling debt and marketable equity securities in our Financial Services segment, purchases of property, plant and equipment and funding strategic growth acquisitions. Cash used in the current period reflects the purchase of our plant facilities in Hamlet, North Carolina and development of our facility in Glendale, Arizona. These expenditures were partially offset by a $12.2 million return of invested capital from one of our equity method joint ventures. Cash used in the prior period reflects the purchase of Commodore and Craftsman.
Net cash used in financing activities for the current period was primarily for the repurchase of common stock. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements

of our off-balance sheet commitments, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference. Obligations and Commitments.
There were no material changes to the obligations and commitments as set forth in the Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Estimates There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to those disclosed in Part II, Item 7 of the Form 10-K, under the heading "Critical Accounting Estimates," which provides a discussion of the critical accounting estimates that management believes affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes from the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk previously disclosed in the Form 10-K. 30 Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its President and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, its disclosure controls and procedures were effective. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 31 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings
See the information under the "Legal Matters" caption in Note
17
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Item 1A. Risk Factors
In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A,
Risk Factors , in the Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Form 10-K. These are also not the only risks facing the Company; additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
The following risk factors are added as Business and Operational Risks, Industry and Economic Risks and Legal and Regulatory Risks as noted below. Business and Operational Risks Shutdowns or delays at the United States/Mexico border could affect the Company's ability to ship materials to and receive finished goods from our Mexico production facilities
Our production operations in Mexico are dependent upon receiving materials from facilities in Presidio, Texas, and our sales from our Mexican operations are dependent upon shipments from our Ojinaga, Mexico facility. Shutdown or delays at the United States/Mexico border could impact our production at the Mexico facilities or our ability to receive finished goods from our Mexico facilities into the Unites States following production, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Casualty losses associated with the Company's transportation operations may be large, which could adversely impact our financial performance
In the ordinary course of business, we may incur property or casualty losses during the transportation of raw materials or finished homes. Although we maintain general liability insurance, estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, and claims may ultimately prove to be more severe than our estimates. This, along with legal expenses, incurred but not reported claims, and other uncertainties can cause unfavorable differences between actual costs and our reserve estimates. Accordingly, ultimate results may differ materially from our estimates, which could result in losses and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Industry and Economic Risks Changes in the exchange rates for Mexican Pesos could adversely affect the value of the Company's investments in Mexico and cause foreign exchange losses We have production operations in Mexico, and unfavorable changes in the exchange rate for Mexican Pesos could adversely affect the reported value of our investments and/or results of operations. 32 Table of Contents Legal and Regulatory Risks Changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's operations and profitability We are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Department of Homeland Security and other state and federal agencies. Future laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations may be more stringent, require changes in our operating practices, or require us to incur significant additional costs, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities As announced on May 26, 2022 in a current report on Form 8-K, the Company's Board of Directors approved a $100 million stock repurchase program with the same terms and conditions as the previous plan. The repurchase program is funded using our available cash.
