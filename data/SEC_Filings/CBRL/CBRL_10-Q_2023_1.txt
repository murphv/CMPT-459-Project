NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except percentages, share and per share data)
(Unaudited)
1.
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, in
these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Company”) are principally engaged in the operation and development in the United States of the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store® (“Cracker Barrel”) concept.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) without audit.  In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring items) necessary for a fair presentation of such condensed consolidated financial statements have been made.  The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily
indicative of results for a full year.
These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 29, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”).  The accounting policies used in preparing these condensed
consolidated financial statements are the same as described in the 2022 Form 10-K.  References to a year in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are to the Company’s fiscal year unless otherwise noted.
COVID-19 Impact
While all of our dining rooms are currently operating without
COVID-19-related restrictions, it is possible that renewed outbreaks or increases in cases and/or new variants of the disease, either as part of a national trend or on a more localized basis, could result in COVID-19-related restrictions including
capacity restrictions, otherwise limit our dine-in services, or negatively affect consumer demand.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company instituted operational
protocols to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to protect the health and safety of employees and guests, and the Company implemented and continually adapted a number of strategies to support the recovery of our business and navigate
through the uncertain environment.  The Company continues to focus on growing its off-premise business and investing in its digital infrastructure to improve the guest experience in the face of these ongoing challenges.

Index
The Company did
no t have any
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at January 27, 2023 and July 29, 2022. The Company’s money market fund investments are measured at fair value using quoted market prices.  The Company’s deferred compensation plan assets are
measured based on net asset value per share as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. The fair values of the Company’s accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying amounts because of their short duration. The fair value
of the Company’s variable rate debt, based on quoted market prices, which are considered Level 1 inputs, approximates its carrying amount at January 27, 2023 and July 29, 2022.
The Company’s financial instruments that are not remeasured at fair value include the
0.625 % convertible Senior Notes (see Note 4). The Company estimates the fair value of the Notes through consideration of quoted market prices of similar instruments, classified as Level 2. The
estimated fair value of the Notes was $ 269,625
and $ 255,894 , respectively, as of January 27, 2023 and July 29, 2022 .

Debt
On June 17, 2022, the Company entered into a
five-year
$ 700,000
revolving credit facility (the “2022 Revolving Credit
Facility”) with substantially the same terms and financial covenants as our previous amended $ 800,000
revolving credit facility, which it
replaced. The 2022 Revolving Credit Facility also contains an option to increase the revolving credit facility by $ 200,000 .  The
Company’s outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility were $ 160,000
and $ 130,000
on January 27, 2023 and July 29, 2022, respectively.
At January 27, 2023, the Company had $ 31,896
of standby letters of credit, which reduce the Company’s borrowing availability under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility (see Note 10 for more information on the Company’s standby
letters of credit).  At January 27, 2023, the Company had $ 508,104
in borrowing availability under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility.
In accordance with the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, outstanding borrowings bear interest, at the Company’s election, either
at Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or prime plus or a rate of
0.5 % in excess of the Federal Funds Rate plus an applicable
margin based on certain specified financial ratios. At January 27, 2023, the weighted average interest rate on the Company’s outstanding borrowings was
5.96 %.
The 2022 Revolving Credit Facility contains customary financial covenants, which include maintenance of a maximum consolidated
total senior secured leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio.  At January 27, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility.
The 2022 Revolving Credit Facility also imposes restrictions on the amount of dividends the Company is permitted to pay and the
amount of shares the Company is permitted to repurchase. Under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, provided there is no default existing and the total of the Company’s availability under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility plus the Company’s cash
and cash equivalents on hand is at least $ 100,000
(the “Cash Availability”), the Company may declare and pay cash dividends on shares of
its common stock and repurchase shares of its common stock (1) in an unlimited amount if, at the time such dividend or repurchase is made, the Company’s consolidated total senior secured leverage ratio is
2.75
to 1.00 or less and (2) in an aggregate amount not to exceed $ 100,000
in any fiscal year if the Company’s consolidated total leverage ratio is greater than
2.75
to 1.00 at the time the dividend or
repurchase is made; notwithstanding (1) and (2), so long as immediately after giving effect to the payment of any such dividends, Cash Availability is at least $ 100,000 , the Company may declare and pay cash dividends on shares of its common stock in an aggregate amount not to exceed in any fiscal year the product of the aggregate amount of dividends
declared in the fourth quarter of the immediately preceding fiscal year multiplied by
four .

Index
Convertible Senior Notes
On June 18, 2021, the Company completed a $ 300,000
principal aggregate amount private offering of
0.625 % convertible
Senior Notes due in 2026 (the “Notes”). The Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association as the Trustee. The Notes will mature on
June 15, 2026 , unless earlier converted, repurchased or redeemed. The Notes bear cash interest at an annual rate of
0.625 %, payable
semi-annually
in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each
year.
The Notes are unsecured obligations and do not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of
dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. In an event of default, the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the notes then
outstanding will immediately become due and payable. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect, at its option, that the sole remedy for an event of default relating to certain failures by the Company to comply with certain
reporting covenants in the Indenture will consist exclusively of the right of the noteholders to receive special interest on the Notes for up to
180
calendar days during which such event of default has occurred and is continuing, at a specified rate for the first 90 days of
0.25 % per
annum, and thereafter at a rate of
0.50 % per annum, on the principal amount of the Notes.
The initial conversion rate applicable to the Notes was
5.3153
shares of the Company’s common stock per $ 1,000
principal amount of
Notes, which represented an initial conversion price of approximately $ 188.14
per share of the Company’s common stock, a premium of
25.0 % over the last reported sale price of $ 150.51
per share on June 15, 2021, the date on which the Notes were priced. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events, including the payment of dividends to holders of the Company’s common stock. As of
January 27, 2023, the conversion rate, as adjusted, was
5.7469
shares of the Company’s common stock per $ 1,000
principal amount of Notes. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change” occur, then the conversion
rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.
Net proceeds from the Notes offering were $ 291,125 , after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and the Company’s offering fees and expenses.
The Notes are accounted for entirely as a liability, and the issuance costs of the Notes are accounted for wholly as debt
issuance costs.

Index
During any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2021, in which the closing price of the Company’s common stock
exceeds
130 % of the applicable conversion price of the Notes on at least
20
of the last
30
consecutive trading days of the quarter, holders may in the
quarter immediately following, convert all or a portion of their Notes. The holders of the Notes were not eligible to convert their Notes during 2023, 2022 or 2021. When a conversion notice is received, the Company has the option to pay or deliver
the conversion amount entirely in cash or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, as of January 27, 2023, the Company could not be required to settle the Notes and, therefore, the Notes are classified as
long-term debt.
Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions
In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “Convertible
Note Hedge Transactions”) with certain of the initial purchasers of the Notes and/or their respective affiliates and other financial institutions (in this capacity, the “Hedge Counterparties”). Concurrently with the Company’s entry into the
Convertible Note Hedge Transactions, the Company also entered into separate, warrant transactions with the Hedge Counterparties collectively relating to the same number of shares of the Company’s common stock, which initially was approximately
1,600,000
shares, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, and for which the Company received proceeds that partially offset the cost of entering
into the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions (the “Warrant Transactions”).
The Convertible Note Hedge Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of the
Company’s common stock that initially underlay the Notes, and are expected generally to reduce the potential equity dilution, and/or offset any cash payments in excess of the principal amount due, as the case may be, upon conversion of the Notes.
The Warrant Transactions could have a dilutive effect on the Company’s common stock to the extent that the price of its common stock exceeds the strike price of the Warrant Transactions. The strike price was initially $ 263.39
per share and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Warrant Transactions. As of January 27, 2023, the strike price, as
adjusted, of the Warrant Transactions was $ 243.61
per share as a result of dividends declared since the Notes were issued.
The portion of the net proceeds to the Company from the offering of the Notes that was used to pay the premium on the
Convertible Note Hedge Transactions, net of the proceeds to the Company from the Warrant Transactions, was approximately $ 30,310 . The net
costs incurred in connection with the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions and Warrant Transactions were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet during 2021.
Because these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions and Warrant Transactions
were recorded in shareholders’ equity, not accounted for as derivatives and are not remeasured each reporting period.
5.
Seasonality
Historically, the revenue and net income of the Company have been lower in the first and third quarters and higher in the second and fourth quarters.
Management attributes these variations to the holiday shopping season and the summer vacation and travel season.  The Company’s retail sales, which are made substantially to the Company’s restaurant customers, historically have been highest in the
Company’s second quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season.  Historically, interstate tourist traffic and the propensity to dine out have been higher during the summer months, thereby contributing to higher profits in the Company’s fourth
quarter.  The Company generally opens additional new locations throughout the year.  Therefore, the results of operations for any interim period cannot be considered indicative of the operating results for an entire year.
Currently, the Company is not able to predict the impact that future variants of COVID-19 may have on these historical consumer demand patterns or, as a result, on the seasonality of its business generally.
6.
Segment Information
Cracker Barrel stores represent a single, integrated operation with
two
related and substantially integrated product lines.  The operating expenses of the restaurant and retail product lines of a Cracker Barrel store are shared and are indistinguishable in many respects.
Accordingly, the Company currently manages its business on the basis of
one
reportable operating segment.  All of the Company’s operations
are located within the United States.

7.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue consists primarily of sales from restaurant and retail operations. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation
by transferring control over a product or service to a restaurant guest, retail customer or other customer.  The Company’s policy is to present sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income on a net presentation basis after deducting sales
tax.

Restaurant Revenue
The Company recognizes revenues from restaurant sales when payment is tendered at the point of sale, as the Company’s performance obligation to
provide food and beverages is satisfied.
Retail Revenue
The Company recognizes revenues from retail sales when payment is tendered at the point of sale, as the Company’s performance obligation to provide
merchandise is satisfied.  Ecommerce sales, including shipping revenue, are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Additionally, estimated sales returns are calculated based on return history and sales levels.
Gift Card Breakage
Included in restaurant and retail revenue is gift card breakage.  Customer purchases of
gift cards, to be utilized at the Company’s stores, are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases food and/or merchandise.   Gift cards do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers can redeem their gift
cards indefinitely. A certain number of gift cards will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes gift card breakage revenue for these amounts in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income over
the expected redemption period.
Gift card breakage is recognized when the likelihood of a gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote, and the Company determines that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift card
balance to the relevant jurisdiction.
The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon the Company’s specific historical redemption patterns. The Company recognizes gift card
breakage by applying its estimate of the rate of gift card breakage over the period of estimated redemption.  For the quarter and six months ended January 27, 2023, gift card breakage was $ 2,183
and $ 3,488 , respectively.  For the quarter and six months ended January 28,
2022, gift card breakage was $ 2,164
and $ 3,269 ,
respectively.
Deferred revenue related to the Company’s gift cards was
$ 114,478
and
$ 93,569 ,
respectively, at
January 27, 2023
and July
29,
2022.   Revenue recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the six months ended
January 27, 2023
and
January 28, 2022,
respectively, for the redemption of gift cards which were included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the fiscal year was
$ 27,507
and
$ 28,809 .
8.
Leases
The Company has ground leases for its leased stores and office space leases that are recorded as operating leases under various non-cancellable
operating leases. The Company also leases advertising billboards, vehicle fleets, and certain equipment under various non-cancellable operating leases. Additionally, the Company completed sale-leaseback transactions in 2009, 2020 and 2021 (see
section below entitled “Sale and Leaseback Transactions”). To determine whether a contract is or contains a lease, the Company determines at contract inception whether it contains the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period
of time in exchange for consideration. If the contract has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset, the Company recognizes a
right-of-use asset and lease liability.
11
Index
The Company’s leases all have varying terms and expire at various dates through 2055. Restaurant leases typically have base terms of
ten years
with
four
to
five
optional renewal periods of
five years
each. The Company uses a lease life that generally begins on the commencement date, including the rent holiday periods, and generally extends through certain renewal periods that can be exercised at the Company’s option.
During rent holiday
periods, which include the pre-opening period during construction, the Company has possession of and access to the property, but is not obligated to, and normally does not, make rent payments .
The Company has included lease
renewal options in the lease term for calculations of the right-of-use asset and liability for which at the commencement of the lease it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those renewal options. Additionally, some of the leases
have contingent rent provisions and others require adjustments for inflation or index.
Contingent rent is determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels. The
Company records a contingent rent liability and corresponding rent expense when it is probable sales have been achieved in amounts in excess of the specified levels.
The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual
value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
The Company has entered into agreements for real estate leases that are not recorded as right-of-use assets or lease liabilities as we have not
yet taken possession. These leases are expected to commence in 2023 and 2024 with undiscounted future payments of $ 3,232
and $ 35,255 , respectively.
The Company has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components. Additionally, the Company has elected to apply the short term lease
exemption to all asset classes and the short term lease expense for the period reasonably reflects the short term lease commitments. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate based on
the information available at the time of commencement or modification date in determining the present value of lease payments. For operating leases that commenced prior to the date of adoption of the new lease accounting guidance, the Company
used the incremental borrowing rate as of the adoption date. Assumptions used in determining the Company’s incremental borrowing rate include the Company’s implied credit rating and an estimate of secured borrowing rates based on comparable
market data.

Sale and Leaseback Transactions
In 2009, the Company completed sale-leaseback transactions involving
15
of its owned stores and its retail distribution center. Under the transactions, the land, buildings and improvements at the locations were sold and leased back for terms of
20
and
15
years, respectively. Equipment
was not included. The leases include specified renewal options for up to
20
additional years.
On July 29, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with the original lessor and a third party financier to obtain ownership of
64
of the
65
Cracker Barrel properties
previously covered in the original sale and leaseback arrangement and simultaneously entered into a sale and leaseback transaction with the financier for an aggregate purchase price, net of closing costs, of $ 198,083 . The Company purchased the remaining property for approximately $ 3,200 . In connection with this sale and leaseback transaction, the Company entered into lease agreements for each of the properties for initial terms of
20
years and renewal options up to
50
years. The aggregate initial annual rent payment for the properties is approximately $ 14,379
and includes
1 % annual rent increases over the initial lease terms. All the properties qualified for sale and leaseback and operating lease accounting classification
and the Company recorded a gain on the sale and leaseback transaction of $ 69,954
in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Company recorded
operating lease right-of-use assets, including a non-cash asset recognized as a part of accounting for the transaction of $ 79,049 , and
corresponding operating lease liabilities of $ 261,698
and $ 182,649 , respectively.
On August 4, 2020, the Company completed a subsequent sale and leaseback transaction involving
62
of its owned Cracker Barrel stores for an aggregate purchase price, net of closing costs, of $ 146,357 . Under the transaction, the land, buildings and building improvements at the locations were sold and leased back for initial terms of
20
years and renewal options up to
50
years. The aggregate
initial annual rent payment for the properties is approximately $ 10,393
and includes
1 % annual rent increases over the initial lease terms. All of the properties qualified for sale and leaseback and operating lease accounting classification, and the Company
recorded a gain of $ 217,722
which is recorded in the gain on sale and leaseback transaction line in the Condensed Consolidated
Statement of Income in the first quarter of 2021. The Company also recorded operating lease right-of-use assets, including a non-cash asset recognized as part of accounting for the transaction of $ 175,960 , and corresponding operating lease liabilities of $ 309,624
and $ 133,663 , respectively.

Net Income Per Share and Weighted Average Shares
B asic consolidated net income per share is computed by dividing consolidated net income
available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the reporting period. Diluted consolidated net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities, options or
other contracts to issue shares of common stock were exercised or converted into shares of common stock and is based upon the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common equivalent shares outstanding during the reporting period.
Common equivalent shares related to nonvested stock awards and units issued by the Company are calculated using the treasury stock method. The outstanding nonvested stock awards and units issued by the Company represent the only dilutive effects on
diluted consolidated net income per shar e.
The Company’s convertible senior notes and related warrants are calculated using the net share settlement option under the if converted method. Because the principal amount of the convertible senior notes will be settled in cash with any
excess conversion value settled in cash or shares of common stock, the convertible senior notes have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the average market price of the Company’s common stock during the
reporting period did not exceed the conversion price of $ 176.18
as of January 27, 2023. Warrants were excluded from the computation of
diluted earnings per share since the warrants’ strike price of $ 243.61
was greater than the average market price of the Company’s common
stock during the period. See Note 4 for additional information regarding the Company’s convertible senior notes.

Commitments and Contingencies
The Company and its subsidiaries are party to various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims incidental to their business in the ordinary
course.  In the opinion of management, based upon information currently available, the ultimate liability with respect to these contingencies will not materially affect the Company’s financial statements.
Related to its insurance coverage, the Company is contingently liable pursuant to standby letters of credit as credit guarantees to certain insurers.
As of January 27, 2023, the Company had $ 31,896
of standby letters of credit related to securing reserved claims under workers’
compensation insurance
and the July 29, 2020 and August 4, 2020 sale and leaseback transactions .  All standby letters of credit are renewable annually and reduce the Company’s
borrowing availability under its 2022 Revolving Credit Facility (see Note 4).
The Company enters into certain indemnification agreements in favor of third parties in the ordinary course of business.  The Company believes that
the probability of incurring an actual liability under such indemnification agreements is sufficiently remote that no such liability has been recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 27, 2023.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “our” or “we”) are principally engaged in the operation and development in the United States of the
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store® (“Cracker Barrel”) concept.  At January 27, 2023, we operated 665 Cracker Barrel stores in 45 states and 56 Maple Street Biscuit Company (“MSBC”) locations in ten states.
All dollar amounts reported or discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) are shown in thousands, except per share

Overview
Management believes that Cracker Barrel’s brand remains one of the strongest and most differentiated brands in the restaurant industry, and we plan to continue to leverage and build on that
strength as a core competitive component of our business strategy.  Our long-term strategy remains centered on driving sustainable sales growth, continued business model improvements, building profitable Cracker Barrel and MSBC stores, and
driving shareholder returns.  During the second quarter of 2023, we made progress in key areas of the business, including maintaining a strong value proposition, growing our off-premise business, delivering continued strong retail sales,
marketing, and culinary innovation to grow average check through introduction of add-on menu items such as sides and beverages and other menu enhancements, thoughtful expansion of MSBC, and store-level operational excellence.  We believe there is
significant uncertainty in macroeconomic factors that may affect our business in the remainder of 2023, but we remain focused on delivering long-term growth and returns for shareholders.
Key Performance Indicators
Management uses a number of key performance measures to evaluate our operational and financial performance, including the following:
•
Comparable store restaurant sales increase/(decrease) : To calculate comparable store restaurant sales increase/(decrease), we determine total restaurant sales of stores open at least six full quarters before the beginning of the
applicable period, measured on comparable calendar weeks.  We then subtract total comparable store restaurant sales for the current year period from total comparable store restaurant sales for the applicable historical period to calculate
the absolute dollar change.  To calculate comparable store restaurant sales increase/(decrease), which we express as a percentage, we divide the absolute dollar change by the comparable store restaurant sales for the historical period.
•
Comparable store average restaurant sales : To calculate comparable store average restaurant sales, we determine total restaurant sales of stores open at least six full quarters before the beginning of the applicable period,
measured on comparable calendar weeks, and divide by the number of comparable stores for the applicable period.
•
Comparable store retail sales increase/(decrease) : To calculate comparable store retail sales increase/(decrease), we determine total retail sales of stores open at least six full quarters before the beginning of the applicable
period, measured on comparable calendar weeks.  We then subtract total comparable store retail sales for the current year period from total comparable store retail sales for the applicable historical period to calculate the absolute
dollar change.  To calculate comparable store retail sales increase/(decrease), which we express as a percentage, we divide the absolute dollar change by the comparable store retail sales for the historical period.
•
Comparable store retail average weekly sales : To calculate comparable store average retail sales, we determine total retail sales of stores open at least six full quarters before the beginning of the applicable period, measured
on comparable calendar weeks, and divide by the number of comparable stores for the applicable period.
•
Comparable restaurant guest traffic increase/(decrease) : To calculate comparable restaurant guest traffic increase/(decrease), we determine the number of entrees sold in our dine-in and off-premise business from stores open at
least six full quarters at the beginning of the applicable period, measured on comparable calendar weeks.  We then subtract total entrees sold for the current year period from total entrees sold for the applicable historical period to
calculate the absolute numerical change.  To calculate comparable restaurant guest traffic increase/(decrease), which we express as a percentage, we divide the absolute numerical change by the total entrees sold for the historical period.

•
Average check increase per guest : To calculate average check per guest, we determine comparable store restaurant sales, as described above, and divide by comparable guest traffic (as described above). We then subtract average
check per guest for the current year period from average check per guest for the applicable historical period to calculate the absolute dollar change.  The absolute dollar change is divided by the prior year average check number to
calculate average check increase per guest, which we express as a percentage.
These performance indicators exclude the impact of new store openings and sales related to MSBC.
We use comparable store sales metrics as indicators of sales growth to evaluate how our established stores have performed over time.  We use comparable restaurant guest traffic
increase/(decrease) to evaluate how established stores have performed over time, excluding growth achieved through menu price and sales mix change.  Finally, we use average check per guest to identify trends in guest preferences, as well as the
effectiveness of menu changes.  We believe these performance indicators are useful for investors by providing a consistent comparison of sales results and trends across comparable periods within our core, established store base, unaffected by
results of store openings, closings, and other transitional changes.

Comparable store sales and traffic consist of sales of stores open at least six full quarters at the beginning of the period and
are measured on comparable calendar weeks.  Comparable store sales and traffic exclude MSBC.
For the second quarter of 2023, our comparable store restaurant sales increased as a result of a 10.1% average check increase (including an 8.9% average menu price increase) partially offset by a
1.7% guest traffic decrease as compared to the prior year period.  For the first six months of 2023, our comparable store restaurant sales increased as a result of a 9.5% average check increase (including an 8.4% average menu price increase)
partially offset by a 1.8% guest traffic decrease as compared to the prior year period.   While all of our dining rooms are currently operating without COVID-19-related restrictions, it is possible that renewed outbreaks or increases in cases
and/or new variants of the disease, either as part of a national trend or on a more localized basis, could result in COVID-19-related restrictions including capacity restrictions, otherwise limit our dine-in services, or negatively affect
consumer demand.
Our retail sales are made substantially to our restaurant guests.  For the second quarter and the first six months of 2023, our comparable store retail sales increases resulted primarily from the
strong performance in the apparel and accessories merchandise categories.

The increases in restaurant cost of goods sold as a percentage of restaurant revenue in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 as compared to the same periods in the prior year were
primarily the result of commodity inflation, higher freight costs and a shift to higher cost menu items partially offset by the menu price increase referenced above.  Commodity inflation was 12.5% and 14.5%, respectively, for the second quarter
and first six months of 2023.  Higher freight costs accounted for an increase of 0.1% as a percentage of restaurant revenue for both the second quarter and first six months of 2023 as compared to the same periods in the prior year.  Higher cost
menu items accounted for increases of 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively, as a percentage of restaurant revenue for the first six months of 2023 as compared to the same periods in the prior year.
We continue to partially offset inflationary pressures through menu price increases and operational improvements, and we presently expect the rate of commodity inflation to be approximately 8.5%
to 9.0% for the full year 2023, which assumes commodity inflation in the mid-single digits in the third quarter of 2023 and in the low-single digits in the fourth quarter of 2023.
The increase in retail cost of goods sold as a percentage of retail revenue in the second quarter of 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year resulted from higher markdowns.
The increase in retail cost of goods sold as a percentage of retail revenue in the first six months of 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year resulted from higher markdowns and the

The decreases in store management compensation as a percentage of total revenue for the second quarter and first six months of 2023 as compared to the same periods in the prior year were
primarily driven by the increases in total revenue in 2023 partially offset by wage inflation.
The decrease in store hourly labor expense as a percentage of total revenue for the second quarter of 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior year resulted primarily from the increase in
total revenue partially offset by wage inflation.  In addition to menu price increases, we continue to partially offset inflationary pressures through labor productivity initiatives, and we presently expect the rate of wage inflation to be
approximately 6.5% in 2023.
Other Store Operating Expenses
Other store operating expenses include all store-level operating costs, the major components of which are operating supplies, repairs and maintenance, utilities, depreciation and amortization,

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operations and our borrowing capacity under our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility.  Our internally generated cash, along with cash on
hand at July 29, 2022 and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, were sufficient to finance all of our growth, dividend payments, share repurchases, working capital needs, interest payments under our revolving credit facility and other
cash payment obligations in the first six months of 2023. We believe that cash on hand at January 27, 2023, along with cash expected to be generated from our operating activities and the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility,
will be sufficient to finance our continuing operations, our continuing expansion plans, share repurchases and working capital needs over the next twelve months.  We believe that cash expected to be generated from our operating activities and the
borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance our continuing operations, dividend payments, capital expenditures, interest expense on long-term debt obligations, operating lease obligations, continuing
expansion plans, share repurchases and working capital needs beyond the next twelve months.  Our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility is subject to the satisfaction of provisions of the credit facility, as amended, and we believe we
will be able to refinance our revolving credit facility and other debt instruments prior to their maturity.
Cash Generated From Operations
Our operating activities provided net cash of $100,822 for the first six months of 2023, representing a decrease from the $107,793 net cash provided during the first six months of 2022.  This
decrease resulted primarily from the timing of payments for accounts payable and certain taxes partially offset by the change in retail inventory.
Borrowing Capacity, Debt Covenants and Notes
On June 17, 2022, we entered into a five-year $700,000 revolving credit facility (the “2022 Revolving Credit Facility”) with substantially the same terms and financial covenants as our previous
amended $800,000 revolving credit facility.  The 2022 Revolving Credit Facility also contains an option for the Company to increase the revolving credit facility by $200,000.
At January 27, 2023, we had $160,000 of outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility and $31,896 of standby letters of credit related to securing reserved claims under our
workers’ compensation insurance and our July 29, 2020 and August 4, 2020 sale and leaseback transactions, which reduce our borrowing availability under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility.  At January 27, 2023, we had $508,104 in borrowing
availability under our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility.  During the first six months of 2023, we borrowed $90,000 and repaid $60,000 under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility.  See Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information on our long-term debt.
Our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility contains customary financial covenants, which include maintenance of a maximum consolidated total senior secured leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated
interest coverage ratio.  We were in compliance with the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility’s financial covenants at July 29, 2022, and we expect to be in compliance with the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility’s financial covenants for the remaining term
of the facility.
On June 18, 2021, the Company entered into an issuance and sale of $300,000 aggregate principal amount of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026.  The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of
the Company and bear cash interest at a rate of 0.625% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which initiated on December 15, 2021.  The Notes mature on June 15, 2026, unless earlier converted,
repurchased or redeemed.
Capital Expenditures and Proceeds from Sale of Property and Equipment
Capital expenditures (purchase of property and equipment) net of proceeds from insurance recoveries were $48,369 for the first six months of 2023 as compared to $29,763 for the same period in the
prior year.  Our capital expenditures consisted primarily of capital investments for existing stores, new store locations and capital expenditures for strategic initiatives.  The increase in capital expenditures in the first six months of 2023
from the first six months of 2022 resulted primarily from increased capital expenditures for existing stores and an increase in the number of new store locations as compared to the prior year.  We estimate that our capital expenditures during
2023 will be approximately $110,000 to $120,000.  This estimate includes the acquisition of sites and construction costs of new MSBC locations that have opened or that we expect to open during 2023, as well as for acquisition and construction
costs for new Cracker Barrel and MSBC locations that we plan to be opened in 2024.  We intend to fund our capital expenditures with cash generated by operations and borrowings under our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, as necessary.

Index
Dividends, Share Repurchases and Share-Based Compensation Awards
Our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility imposes restrictions on the amount of dividends we are permitted to pay and the amount of shares we are permitted to repurchase.  Under the 2022 Revolving
Credit Facility, provided there is no default existing and the total of our availability under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility plus our cash and cash equivalents on hand is at least $100,000 (the “Cash Availability”), we may declare and pay
cash dividends on shares of our common stock and repurchase shares of our common stock (1) in an unlimited amount if at the time the dividend or the repurchase is made our consolidated total senior secured leverage ratio is 2.75 to 1.00 or less
and (2) in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100,000 in any fiscal year if our consolidated total leverage ratio is greater than 2.75 to 1.00 at the time the dividend or repurchase is made; notwithstanding (1) and (2), so long as immediately
after giving effect to the payment of any such dividends, Cash Availability is at least $100,000, we may declare and pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount not to exceed in any fiscal year the product of the
aggregate amount of dividends declared in the fourth quarter of the immediately preceding fiscal year multiplied by four.
During the first six months of 2023, we paid a regular dividend of $2.60 per share and declared a dividend of $1.30 per share that was subsequently paid on January 31, 2023, to shareholders of
record on January 12, 2023.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we were authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at management’s discretion up to a total value of
$200,000.  During the first six months of 2023, we repurchased 171,792 shares of our common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $17,449 pursuant to this authorization.
During the first six months of 2023, we issued 41,149 shares of our common stock resulting from the vesting of share-based compensation awards.  Related tax withholding payments on these
share-based compensation awards resulted in a net use of cash of $2,400.
Working Capital
In the restaurant industry, virtually all sales are either for third-party credit or debit card or cash.   Restaurant inventories purchased through our principal food distributor are on terms of
net zero days, while restaurant inventories purchased locally are generally financed from normal trade credit.  Because of our retail gift shops, which have a lower product turnover than the restaurant business, we carry larger inventories than
many other companies in the restaurant industry.  Retail inventories purchased domestically are generally financed from normal trade credit, while imported retail inventories are generally purchased through wire transfers.  These various trade
terms are aided by the rapid turnover of the restaurant inventory.  Employees generally are paid on weekly or semi-monthly schedules in arrears for hours worked except for bonuses that are paid either quarterly or annually in arrears.  Many other
operating expenses have normal trade terms and certain expenses, such as certain taxes and some benefits, are deferred for longer periods of time.
We had negative working capital of $162,108 at January 27, 2023 versus negative working capital of $185,048 at July 29, 2022.  The change in working capital from July 29, 2022 to January 27, 2023
primarily resulted from the timing of payments for accounts payable and certain taxes partially offset by the decrease in retail inventory levels.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.
Material Commitments
There have been no material changes in our material commitments other than in the ordinary course of business since the end of 2022.  Refer to the sub-section entitled “Material Commitments”
under the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” presented in the MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our material commitments.

Critical Accounting Estimates
We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures.  We base our estimates and judgments on historical
experience, current trends, outside advice from parties believed to be experts in such matters, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from those assumptions and
estimates, and such differences could be material.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the 2022 Form 10-K.  Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of
those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.
Critical accounting estimates are those that:
•
management believes are most important to the accurate portrayal of both our financial condition and operating results, and
•
require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
We consider the following accounting estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements:
•
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
•
Insurance Reserves
•
Retail Inventory Valuation
•
Lease Accounting
Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets is
measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If the total expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the carrying value is
written down, for an asset to be held and used, to the estimated fair value or, for an asset to be disposed of, to the fair value, net of estimated costs of disposal.  Any loss resulting from impairment is recognized by a charge to income.
Judgments and estimates that we make related to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and future cash flows are affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance.  The accuracy of such
provisions can vary materially from original estimates and management regularly monitors the adequacy of the provisions until final disposition occurs.
We have not made any material changes in our methodology for assessing impairments during the first six months of 2023, and we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will
be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used by us in the future to assess impairment of long-lived assets.  However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and
fair values of long-lived assets, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.  It is possible that we may recognize impairment as a result of the unknown impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and our response.

Insurance   Reserves
We self-insure a significant portion of our expected workers’ compensation and general liability insurance programs.  We purchase insurance for individual workers’ compensation claims that exceed
$250, $750 or $1,000 depending on the state in which the claim originated.  We purchase insurance for individual general liability claims that exceed $500.  We record a reserve for workers’ compensation and general liability for all unresolved
claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims.  These reserves and estimates of IBNR claims are based upon a full scope actuarial study which is performed annually at the end of our first quarter and is adjusted by the
actuarially determined losses and actual claims payments for the fourth quarter.  Additionally, we perform limited scope actuarial studies on a quarterly basis to verify and/or modify our reserves.  The reserves and losses in the actuarial study
represent a range of possible outcomes within which no given estimate is more likely than any other estimate.  As such, we record the losses in the lower half of that range and discount them to present value using a risk-free interest rate based
on projected timing of payments.  We also monitor actual claims development, including incurrence or settlement of individual large claims during the interim periods between actuarial studies as another means of estimating the adequacy of our
reserves.
Our group health plans combine the use of self-insured and fully-insured programs.  Benefits for any individual (employee or dependents) in the self-insured group health program are limited.  We
record a liability for the self-insured portion of our group health program for all unpaid claims based upon a loss development analysis derived from actual group health claims payment experience.  Additionally, we record a liability for unpaid
prescription drug claims based on historical experience.
Our accounting policies regarding insurance reserves include certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments regarding economic conditions, the frequency and severity of claims and claim
development history and settlement practices.  We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our insurance reserves during the first six months of 2023 and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there
will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate the insurance reserves.  However, changes in these actuarial assumptions, management judgments or claims experience in the future may produce materially different amounts
of expense that would be reported under these insurance programs.
Retail Inventory Valuation
Cost of goods sold includes the cost of retail merchandise sold at our stores utilizing the retail inventory method (“RIM”).  Under RIM, the valuation of our retail inventories is determined by
applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of our inventories.  Inherent in the RIM calculation are certain inputs, including initial markons, markups, markdowns and shrinkage, which may significantly impact the gross margin calculation
as well as the ending inventory valuation.
Inventory valuation provisions are included for retail inventory obsolescence and retail inventory shrinkage.  Retail inventory is reviewed on a quarterly basis for obsolescence and adjusted as
appropriate based on assumptions made by management and judgment regarding inventory aging and future promotional activities.  Retail inventory also includes an estimate of shrinkage that is adjusted upon physical inventory counts.  Annual
physical inventory counts are conducted based upon a cyclical inventory schedule.  An estimate of shrinkage is recorded for the time period between physical inventory counts by using a two-year average of the physical inventories’ results on a
store-by-store basis.
We have not made any material changes in the methodologies, estimates or assumptions related to our merchandise inventories during the first six months of 2023 and do not believe there is a
reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions in the future.  However, actual obsolescence or shrinkage recorded may produce materially different amounts than we have estimated.
Lease Accounting
We have
ground leases for our leased stores and office space leases that are recorded as operating leases under various non-cancellable operating leases.
Additionally, we lease our retail distribution center, advertising billboards, vehicle fleets, and certain equipment under various non-cancellable operating lea ses.
25
Index
We evaluate our leases at contract inception to determine whether we have the right to control use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.  If we determine
that we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset, we recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability.  Also, at contract
inception, we evaluate our leases to estimate their expected term which includes renewal options that we are reasonably assured that we will exercise, and the classification of the lease as either an operating lease or a finance lease.
Additionally, as our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the time of commencement or modification date in determining the present value of
lease payments. Assumptions used in determining our incremental borrowing rate include our implied credit rating and an estimate of secured borrowing rates based on comparable market data.
We assess the impairment of the right-of-use
asset whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.
Changes in these assumptions and management judgments may produce materially different amounts in the recognition of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.  Additionally, any loss
resulting from an impairment of the right-of-use assets is recognized by a charge to income, which could be material.
ITEM 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
There have been no material changes in our quantitative and qualitative market risks since July 29, 2022.  For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market
risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2022 Form 10-K.
Interest Rate Risk .  We have interest rate risk relative to our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  At January 27, 2023, our
outstanding borrowings totaled $160,000 under our revolving credit facility (see Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).  Loans under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our election, either at the prime rate
or a rate 0.5% in excess of the Federal Funds Rate or a rate 1.0% in excess of one-month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), in each case plus an applicable margin, or the one-, three-, or six-month per annum Term SOFR plus an
applicable margin.  Under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, loans bore interest, at our election, either at the prime rate or London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus a percentage point spread based on certain specified financial ratios.  Our
policy has been to manage interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt (see Notes 4 and 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).  In the fourth quarter of 2021, we issued and sold the Notes, which bear cash interest at a fixed
rate of 0.625% per annum.  The impact of a one-percentage point increase or decrease in the $160,000 of our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility is approximately $1,600 on a pre-tax annualized basis.
Credit Risk.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company issued the Notes and entered into the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions and the Warrant
Transactions with the Hedge Counterparties.  Subject to the changes in the market price of the Company’s common stock price, the Company could be exposed to credit risk arising out of the net settlement of the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions
and the Warrant Transactions in its favor.  Based on the Company’s review of the possible net settlements and the creditworthiness of the Hedge Counterparties and their affiliates, the Company believes it does not have a material exposure to
credit risk as a result of these transactions at this time.
ITEM 4.
Controls and Procedures
Our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer each concluded that as of January 27, 2023, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective for the purposes set forth in the definition thereof in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e).
There have been no changes (including corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses) during the quarter ended January 27, 2023 in our internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
