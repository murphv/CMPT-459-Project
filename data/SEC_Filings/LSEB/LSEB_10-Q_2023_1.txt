1. NATURE
OF OPERATIONS
LSEB
Creative Corp. was incorporated as “Profit Corporation” on April 3 rd , 2019 under Wyoming State regulations with
registered office at 1920 Thomes Ave Ste 610, Cheyenne, WY.
LSEB
Creative Corp. is a specialty retailer that offers men and women elevated swimwear designs, constructed with the highest quality materials
and techniques. Our product concept focuses on coordinating items within the men’s and women’s sub-categories, which allows
customers the ability to coordinate with their partner. It’s this concept, along with our noteworthy fabrics, construction techniques,
and “ready-to-wear” inspired designs that will allow LSEB to capture a new space within the market.
Its
aim is to become a leading retailer in the global luxury fashion industry. The corporation is currently involved in concept, design,
manufacturing, and distribution of its products with emphasis on its swim wear category.
The
Company operates under the web-site address
lsebcreative.com
and its e-commerce platform laurenbentleyswim.com which is complete
however due to Covid, the Company was waiting for the appropriate time to launch and make the site live. The Company expects to launch
the brand with its first collection in the summer 2023.
2. BASIS
OF PRESENTATION, MEASUREMENT
The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (“US GAAP”) and are expressed in United States dollars (“USD”).
3. GOING
CONCERN
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue on a going concern basis. As disclosed in the
balance sheet, the Company has accumulated losses at reporting period. The ability of the Company to continue as a going-concern depends
upon its ability to develop profitable operations and to continue to raise adequate financing. Management is actively targeting sources
of additional financing to provide continuation of the Company’s operations. In order for the Company to meet its liabilities as
they come due and to continue its operations, the Company is solely dependent upon its ability to generate such financing. The Company
is actively seeking financing to fully execute the next phase of the Company’s growth initiatives. Any capital raised will be through
either a private placement or a convertible debenture and will result in the issuance of common shares from the Company’s authorized
capital. The Company believes it can satisfy minimum cash requirements for the next twelve months with either an equity financing, convertible
debenture or if needed, loans from shareholders.
There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to raise funds, in which case the Company may be unable to meet its obligations.
Should the Company be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, the net realizable
value of its assets may be materially less than the amounts recorded in these audited financial statements.
The
company has experienced recurring losses that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.
4.
INTERIM
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The
accompanying financial statements of the Company should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2022. In the opinion of management, the accompanying financial statements reflect all adjustments of a recurring nature considered necessary
to present fairly the Company’s financial position and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the periods shown.
The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
The results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full
year.

5. SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Cash
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had a cash balance of $ 61,845
(March 31, 2022: $ 57,497 ). Cash includes cash on hand and balances with
banks.
Reclassification
Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform to the current year financial statement presentation. These
reclassifications had no effect on previous reported results of operations.
Leases
At
the lease commencement date, right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value
of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the lease contract. If an
interest rate is not explicit in a lease, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period that closely matches the lease
term. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a lease term of less than 12 months .
Advertising
& Promotions
Advertising
costs are recognized as expense in Statement of operations for the period when incurred. For the nine month period ending December 31,
2022, company recognized $ 3,338
(December 31, 2021: $ 1,003 )
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of audited financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Areas involving significant estimates and assumptions
include deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance, valuation of convertible notes, warrants and accruals. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically, and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported
in earnings in the period in which they become known.
Loss
Per Share
The
Company has adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
Topic 260-10 which provides for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic earnings per share
includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in
the earnings of an entity. Diluted earnings per share exclude all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. There
were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding as at each period end.
Inventory
Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The net realizable value
is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the cost of completion and selling expenses.
Foreign
Currency Translation
The
functional currency of the Company is United States dollar. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency
are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. All

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued.)
exchange
gains or losses arising from translation of these foreign currency transactions are included in Statement of operations. The Company
has not, to the date of these financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
ASC
820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements
of assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset
or
paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three
levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
● Level
1 – Valuation based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
● Level
2 – Valuation based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.
● Level
3 – Valuation based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring management’s
best estimate of what market participants would use as fair value.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
In
instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy,
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to
the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
Fair
value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management. The respective
carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these
instruments or interest rates that are comparable to market rates. These financial instruments include cash and accounts payable. The
Company’s cash, which is carried at fair value, is classified as a Level 1 financial instrument. The Company’s bank accounts
are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.
Stock
Based Compensation
The
Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with the provision of ASC 718, which requires that all share-based payments issued
to acquire goods or services, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the statement of operations based on their
fair values, net of estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary,
in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company issues compensatory shares for services including,
but not limited to, executive, management, accounting, operations, corporate communication, financial and administrative consulting services.
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740. The Company provides for federal and provincial income taxes payable, as
well as for those deferred because of the timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus
tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to

taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recoverable or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates
is recognized as income or expense in the period of the change. A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred
income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC-606 by,
●
identifying
the contract(s) with a customer,
●
identifying
the performance obligations in the contract,
●
determining
the transaction price,
●
allocating
the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and
●
recognizing
revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied.
Accordingly,
the Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts are satisfied. Our performance obligations
primarily consist of delivering products to our customers. Control is transferred upon providing the products to customers upon shipment
of our products to the consumers from our ecommerce sites. Once control is transferred to the customer, we have completed our performance
obligation.
Equipment
Equipment
is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated over their estimated useful lives at the following rate and method.
Furniture
and fixtures
20%
per annum - declining balance method
Computer
30%

Routine
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Improvements, that are betterments, are capitalized at cost. The Company recognizes
full quarter’s depreciation in the quarter when the asset is acquired.
Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In
March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04 “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform
on Financial Reporting.” These amendments provide temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference
rate reform. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications
and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued.
It is intended to help stakeholders during the global market-wide reference rate transition period. The guidance is effective for all
entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 and can be adopted as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that
includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020. The Company has not identified loans and other financial instruments that are directly or
indirectly influenced by LIBOR and does not expect the adoption of ASU 2020-04 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.
In April 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04 to codify the final consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
on how an issuer should account for modifications made to equity-classified written call options (hereafter referred to as a warrant
to purchase the issuer’s common stock). The guidance in the ASU requires the issuer to treat a modification of an equity-classified
warrant that does not cause the warrant to become liability-classified as an exchange of the original warrant for a new warrant. This
guidance applies whether the modification is structured as an amendment to the terms and conditions of the warrant or as termination
of the original warrant and issuance of a new warrant. The Company does not expect that the new guidance will significantly impact its
condensed financial statements.
6. PREPAYMENTS
AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
The
prepayment represents the amount paid pursuant of a lease agreement executed with one of the directors for the commercial unit used as
office space by the company. The current term of lease is approx. USD $800 (CAD $1,000) per month for 8 months starting from January
2022 with an option to extend it with mutual consent. The Company executed a Lease Extension Agreement for an additional 12 month period
starting September 1, 2022 and ending August 31, 2023 for USD $800 (CAD $1,000) per month.

11. COVID-19
AND MARKET UPDATE
As
a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced some disruptions throughout calendar years 2022 and 2021, which delayed our strategic
business timelines to establish and launch our brand however fortunately there was no material financial impact as the focus even prior
to COVID was to have an effective and efficient E-commerce website through which we reach target customers.
Management
still continues to monitor the short and long-term impacts of the pandemic. We continue to be cautiously optimistic about the markets
in which we operate and the customers we serve; however, should there be a slowdown in economic activity due to an increase in more contagious
variants of the virus or surges in the number of cases, it is possible that projects could be delayed or canceled or that we could experience
further realignment of timelines for launch of the brand.
The
extent to which our business and results of operations are impacted in future periods will also depend upon a number of other factors.
These include the duration and extent of the pandemic; limitations on the ability of our employees to perform their work due to illness
caused by the pandemic or local, state, or federal orders requiring employees to quarantine; the extent, duration, and effective execution
of ongoing government stabilization and recovery efforts; the efficacy and adoption of vaccines or other preventative treatments; our
customers’ demand for our services; our ability to continue to safely and effectively operate in this environment; and the ability
of our customers to pay us for services rendered. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our vendors and the materials utilized in our
operations continues to evolve and may have an adverse impact on our operations in future periods. Any of these events could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Furthermore, we are required to frequently travel
to Europe to visit our manufacturer and suppliers, and the travel restrictions due to COVID-19 has delayed our sourcing and production.
12. CONTINGENCIES
AND COMMITMENTS
The
Company has entered into a number of Consulting Agreements and pursuant to the Agreements the Company may be required to pay a 2%-3%
finder’s fee associated with any new financings as of December 31, 2022. The Company has not paid a finder’s fee related
to the capital raised as of December 31, 2022.
The
Company has no existing or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any proceeding or pending litigation.
There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or any of their respective affiliates, or any beneficial stockholder,
is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.
13. SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS
The
Company’s management has evaluated subsequent events up February 14, 2023 the date the financial statements were issued, pursuant
to the requirements of ASC 855 and has determined there are no material subsequent events to report except for the following:
On
January 12, 2023, the Company issued

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Act
of 1934, as amended, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but
rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. Words such as
“anticipate,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks”
and “estimates” and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are
beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in
the forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date
of this Form 10-Q.   Investors should carefully consider all of such risks before making an investment decision with respect
to the Company’s stock. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
and summary of selected financial data for LSEB Creative Corp. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment from our Management.
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). These accounting principles require us to make
certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable
based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments
and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material
differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically
dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s
judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read
in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.
We intend for this discussion to provide information
that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements, and the primary
factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements. This discussion
should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended March 31, 2022, which are included
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed with the SEC on July 14, 2022.

ready-to-wear fashions. Our intention is that individually, our designs are versatile enough that they can exceed their intended purpose;
swimming and lounging, making appearances in the customer’s daily wardrobe. To ensure the highest quality in fabrics, hardware and
embellishments, LSEB will put emphasis on the sourcing process for each individually item. Newest technologies in fabrics and manufacturing
will be utilized in design and production stages, and may include technologies such as, quick drying finishes or shapewear fabric. From
goods to packaging and labeling, the brand identity has been absolutely thought through and is evident across all areas.
Our mission is to become a single source of innovative
luxury swimwear for our target market. The Company has recognized the sales and profit potential of luxury swimwear for men and women,
as consumers are willing to invest in the swimwear category and seek new brands and product assortment. We strive to offer consumers
the highest quality products with a new fashion-forward, innovative outlook to swim fashion.
LSEB is dedicated to being a dominant provider
of luxury swimwear globally, and known for:
● Highest quality products and
services
● Accurate, efficient and quality
customer service
● Honesty, integrity and continually
adding value to its customers, partners and associates.
From inception to December 31, 2022 we have incurred
an accumulated deficit of $358,374.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern depends upon its ability to raise
adequate financing and develop profitable operations. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues from our services, we may have to delay
the implementation of our business plan. Management is actively targeting sources of additional financing to provide continuation of the
Company’s operations and growth. In order for the Company to meet its liabilities as they come due and to continue its operations,
the Company is solely dependent upon its ability to generate such financing.
The Company is actively seeking financing for
its current business operation.  The Company is optimistic that the financing will be secured and the going concern risk will
be removed.   Any capital raised will be through a private placement and will result in the issuance of shares of common stock
from the Company’s authorized capital.
Plan of Operation
We were incorporated on April 3, 2019 in Wyoming.
Our business office is located at 30 N. Gould St. #4000, Sheridan, WY 82801.  Our telephone number is 1-800-701-8561. We were
founded by Lauren Bentley, who serves as our President and Director, and Jordan Starkman who serves as the Company’s CFO and director.
LSEB Creative Corp. is a specialty retailer that
offers men and women elevated swimwear designs, constructed with the highest quality materials and techniques. With the recent substantial
growth seen in the swimwear industry, our affluent, contemporary target market is in search of assortment and impressive concepts. By

we will capture this new, sought-after space within the market. Our priority is to design products that offer superior fit, performance,
and comfort while incorporating both function and fashionability. Our strategy is to capitalize on these existing opportunities in the
luxury swimwear market through the development and growth of our web site
www.laurenbentleyswim.com , and wholesaler partnerships
on a global scale. We believe eCommerce will allow our target market convenient and easy access to our products while effectively building
brand awareness and entry into new markets.  We are committed to building a highly recognized brand, offering captivating customer
experiences that drive long-term loyalty. By focusing on these key areas and tactics, we will successfully align ourselves with our target
market and profit accordingly.

LSEB’s operating margin will grow steadily
through the successful implementation of centralized distribution and other key activities, and a focus on maximizing gross margin dollars.
The Company plans to realize additional operating efficiencies both at the corporate level and within its e-commerce site, which will
give the Company the flexibility to offer increased value to its customers and strengthen its competitive position in the industry. In
keeping with our commitment to being a low cost operator, the Company believes it can further leverage its buying power to realize additional
efficiencies in areas such as supply chain, and capital expenditures.
Increase our Brand
Awareness
We will continue to increase
brand awareness and customer loyalty through our consistent marketing efforts and planned web and mobile advertising expansion. Our campaign-focused
marketing programs are designed to reinforce the premium image of our brand and our connection with consumers.
Introduce New Product
Technologies
We will continue to focus
on developing and offering products that incorporate technology-enhanced fabrics and style features that differentiate us in the market
and broaden our customer base. We believe that incorporating new technologies, providing advanced features and using differentiated manufacturing
techniques will reinforce the authenticity and appeal of our products, ultimately driving sales growth.
Broaden the Appeal
of our Products
We will selectively seek
opportunities to expand the appeal of our swimwear line and improve productivity to increase our overall market share. This includes our
post launch plans to expand our product offering in categories such as beachwear and men’s daywear.
Operations
Product
Our product design and development efforts are
led by Lauren Bentley and include a team of designers based in the US and abroad who are dedicated to premium quality.  Our design
and development team identifies trends based on market intelligence and research, proactively seeks the input of our target market and
broadly seeks inspiration consistent with our goals of fit, style and function superiority. As we strive provide our customers with intricately
designed and skillfully constructed garments, our team works closely with our suppliers to ensure specifications are reached. We will
partner with independent inspection, verification, and testing companies, who conduct a variety of tests on our fabrics, testing performance
characteristics including retention, abrasion resistance, colorfastness, and sun damage.  We offer premium swimwear that is optimized
for fit, comfort, functionality and style. By combining functionality with elevated design, our brand not only has strong consumer appeal,
but also attracts a growing core of consumers that desire swimwear suited to their lifestyles. We believe our superior quality and technically
advanced products allow us to maintain premium price points and encourage repeat purchases among our customers.
Design
and Styling
Focusing on luxury swimwear items for both men
and women, LSEB’s collection will embody it’s affluent, contemporary target market entirely. The individual men’s and
women’s sub-collections will be coordinating, as the partnered portion of our target market values looking well put-together as
a couple. The physical presence of our collection has the following defining attributes; fine details and finishings, alluring silhouettes,
coordinating pieces, and a runway-ready look. The designs are highly influenced by ready-to-wear fashions Our intention is that individually,
our designs are versatile enough that they can exceed their intended purpose - swimming and lounging, making appearances in the customer’s
daily wardrobe. To ensure the highest quality in fabrics, hardware and embellishments, LSEB will put emphasis on the sourcing process
for all items individually. Newest technologies in fabrics and manufacturing will be utilized in design and production stages, and may
include technologies such as, quick drying finishes or shapewear fabric. From goods to packaging and labeling, the brand identity has
been absolutely thought through and is evident across all areas.
7
Adjustability, Fit, and Sizing
We believe the authenticity of our products is
driven by a number of factors. These factors include our inspired design process, our use of technical materials, our sophisticated manufacturing
methods and our innovative product features.
LSEB is wholly committed to developing garments
that enhance the customer’s body, evoking feelings of empowerment and boldness. Technologically advanced fabrics, techniques, and
adjustable features, will collectively result in a truly tailored fit, unmatched by anyone.
Women’s
Adjustability functions that appear in some of
our women’s designs include adjustable shoulder straps, tie-back straps, and hook & eye bra closures. Additional notable fir
features include shapewear inserts, underwire or floating underwire to give added support, and molded cups. Each women’s SKU is
designed and constructed with the intention of enhancing the female figure. Sizing scales to vary based upon individual styles but will
categorize as one of the following; numeric sizing (Ex: 2-18) or bra sizing (Ex: 32B/C – 38 B/C).
Men’s
Our goal is not to reconstruct, but to enhance
the fit and styling of men’s swimwear currently on the market. We believe that men desire and deserve a perfectly fitting swim garment,
just as women do. An example our improvements includes the addition of hidden, inner drawstring to our swim trunks, which will reinforce
the zipper and snap closure, ensuring security during use. Other styles include waist fasteners on either side of the body, which allow
the wearer to further adjust the garment, creating a tailored fit. Our technologically advanced stretch net lining conforms to the body
without restriction for optimal comfort. Along with these features, our size offering, which will be numeric (Ex: 26-40) and inseam length
options (Ex: 4” or 6”), will provide the perfect fit for every man.
Since December 31, 2022, and for the next 12 months
comprising of 3 months in our 2023 fiscal year and 9 months during our fiscal year 2024, our business will be built across four key growth
product categories including: (1) Women’s Swimwear, (2) Men’s Swimwear, (3) Women’s Beachwear, and (4) Accessories.
Our growth plan is to achieve $500,000 in net revenues within the first 12 months following our official launch, with majority derived
from category (1), Women’s Swimwear. To date, we have not generated any revenue. This is due to delays incurred by Covid-19, such
as supplier and manufacturer closures, impaired supply chain, and travel restrictions.  The Company plans to complete a financing
through a private offering for a minimum of $400,000 within the 12-month period following our December 31, 2022 quarter-end.  We
have not yet entered into any agreements with any parties with respect to obtaining financing for the Company. Given the Company is able
to obtain financing, the Women’s Swimwear and Men’s Swimwear product category will commence immediately, as well as pre-launch
functions outlined below. We intend to target consumers with on-line marketing, and businesses, including hotels and independent boutiques
with direct mail, and pursuing contacts within the industry. The Company also expects to attend swimwear trade shows across the world.
If we are unable to obtain financing on reasonable
terms, we could be forced to delay or scale back our plans for expansion. In addition, such inability to obtain financing on reasonable
terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. In the unlikely scenario that we
are not successful in financing our target of $400,000 or above through a private offering within the first 12-month period ,
we will delay the launch of the Women’s Beachwear, and move forward solely with Men’s and Women’s Swimwear.
Within 18 months following our December 31, 2022
quarter-end, our total sales forecast is $1,200,000. This target is comprised of $1,000,000 Women’s Swimwear and Men’s Swimwear
categories, and $200,000 Beachwear and Accessories. We anticipate a sales growth rate of approximately 50% per year for our first 3 years
operational.
During this period, the Company will execute all
essential pre-launch functions, including but not limited to, collection design, technical illustrations and specification, sourcing trims,
fabrics, and yarn, sample making, pattern drafting, manufacturer bulk order placement, and various marketing projects. As the Company
performs each function, our management team will make decisions based on the interest of consumer satisfaction and Company profitability.
These functions will prepare the Company for a B2C distribution channel upon launch, as well as B2B wholesale partnerships for future
growth opportunities. Additionally, they will align the Company to achieve our average target margin of 55-65% across our four key product
categories.
8
As of our quarter end December 31, 2022, the Company
has completed a number of the essential functions outlined above. Our first collection, which will launch in conjunction with the brand
and ecommerce site mid 2023, has been designed and technical illustrations have been completed. Out technical packages, which includes
the technical sketches and all specifications on measurements, construction, trim and fabric Bill of Materials, and all additional information
the manufacturing company will need, have been completed by an outsourced Technical Designer. A significant amount of focus went into
the sourcing of collection trims and fabric, as well as brand packaging and labeling. The Company believes in sourcing based on quality,
not ease, in order to develop superior product. Thus, all items are sourced from various countries and factories depending on capabilities,
skills, and technologies. For our first collection, majority of items have been sourced from specialized, established suppliers in Italy,
France, and Spain. The marketing mix is of large focus for the Company, as we understand the importance of marketing within the luxury
market and its role in building brand recognition and credibility. For this reason, we have decided to utilize a third-party, bespoke
marketing agency based out of London, England. Completed initial marketing projects include; the branding package, which includes the
primary logo, secondary logo, and submark, in addition to the overall brand, story and packaging designs; and ecommerce website development,
which will remain private until brand launch. The Company is on track with all necessary functions in order to meet deadlines, targeted
timeframe of launch, and ultimately, all established Company goals.
Initial distribution will be B2C via our ecommerce
website, which will allow us to bypass middlemen and margin loss. Our ecommerce website, as well as our social media pages, will be prepared
by a third-party marketing agency prior to brand launch date. Preparation of these areas of our marketing mix include, website development
and testing, product photography, campaign photography and videography, copywriting, and SEO management. Additionally, these projects,
along with our branding package, will lend themselves to all areas of the marketing mix once completed. Marketing strategies will commence
across all platforms approximately one month before launch date as a tactic to create excitement around the brand and products. On launch
day our ecommerce website will become live for purchasing.
An additional focus prior to brand launch will
be the design of our second, follow-up collection. Our design team will begin the design process of this collection December 2022 –
March 2023. All steps of the process will be completed in accordance with the fashion calendar in order to release said collection for
May/June of 2023. This is essential to ensure consistent product offering and Company sales forecast is met.
Onward, product launches will continue to be developed
and released based on the fashion calendar, with key deliveries falling in January/February, May/June, and October/November. The Company
will consider expanding SKU assortment and product categories based on consumer demand and feedback. The Company believes that when expanding
the product offering, doing so organically is essential to long-term growth and sales plans.
Upon launch of our Summer 2023 collection, we
will commence two key growth strategies; building a full-time team of staff and nurturing wholesale partnerships. We believe organically
growing a team of full-time employees is essential in the future success of the business. Employees will be hired based on their suitability
in the role and connection with the brand. We will take our time hiring the right person for each individual position as it is needed.
By having a full-time team, we will gain the contacts, knowhow, manpower, and consistency needed to operate a successful luxury fashion
brand.
Entering wholesale distribution opportunities
upon brand launch will allow the Company to grow reach within key markets, sales, and brand recognition. The Company intends on partnering
with top luxury retailers across North America and Europe, as well as particular independent retailers and hotel boutiques. The Company
currently maintains relationships with targeted retailers but believes entering wholesale distribution will have the highest growth potential
once the brand is established with sales to show. The partnerships we create will be strategically chosen based on brand values, style,
price point, and expectations. We believe that by progressing into wholesale distribution will allow us to increase sales by approximately
50% consistently through year one to five. We will continue to maintain and gain said partnerships until launching the brand mid 2023.

We have estimated that we will incur minimum expenses equal to $25,000
in the first 12 months following our December 31, 2022, quarter-end in order to maintain our business operations.  However,
if we complete a financing, we will devote the capital raised to operational expenses as indicated below. The Company will attempt to
complete a financing for a minimum of $400,000 within the 12 month period following the Company’s December 31, 2022 quarter-end.  Any
capital raised will be through either a private placement and will result in the issuance of common shares from the Company’s authorized
capital.

Results
of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for the nine months
ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and related management discussion herein.
Our financial statements are stated in U.S. Dollars
and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”).

Going Concern Qualification
Several conditions and events cast substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred cumulative net losses of $358,374 since
its inception and requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place. The Company’s ability
to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful
development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations
are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022
and December 31, 2021
Revenue
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021 we did not have any sales. The Company is in the process of launching a new e-commerce platform, laurenbentleyswim.com.
The Company has been in the process of producing samples for the delivery to factories for production in order to generate revenues as
the Company expands its operations.
Operating Income (Loss)
Operating expenses for the quarter ended December
31, 2022 were $35,708, as compared to $25,527 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.Operating expenses for the nine months ended December
31, 2022 were $106,407, as compared to $78,515 for the nine month period ended December 31, 2021. This loss was due primarily to the professional
fees, consulting fees, and other general and administrative expenses incurred.
Net loss
The Company reported a net loss of $36,019 for
the quarter ended December 31, 2022, and $25,594 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, respectively. We also reported a net loss of
$111,764 for the nine month period ended December 31, 2022, and $81,147 for the nine month period ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022
the Company recorded $44,399 in consulting fees as compared to $30,100 for the nine month period ended December 31, 2021. In addition,
professional fees for the nine month period ended December 31, 2022 were $31,858 as compared to the nine month period ended December 31,
2021 $37,953. The Company expects professional and legal fees to remain consistent going forward as the Company is a public reporting
company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which requires that it maintain relationships with both PCAOB registered audit firms
and securities counsel to assist with the SEC reporting requirements. In addition, the Company may also attempt to purchase other entities
or assets and operations of other entities if the advantageous situation presents itself. This could require the Company to incur substantial
professional fees.
The Company has also reported $5,326 in General
and Administrative Expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $2,784 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The
General and Administrative Expenses for the nine month period ended December 31, 2022 were $22,447 as compared to the nine month period
ended December 31, 2021 $7,481. The increase in General and Administrative Expenses is primarily attributed to travel expense related
to visiting our manufacturer in Porto, Portugal.
We anticipate generating
losses and, therefore, may be unable to continue operations in the future. If we require additional capital, we will have to issue debt
or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party.
Income Tax
During the period from inception (April 3, 2019)
to December 31, 2022, we had no provision for income taxes due to the net operating losses incurred.
11
Off Balance Sheet Financing
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Going Concern
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements,
the Company has no revenue generating operations and has an accumulated deficit $358,374 as of December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company
has experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a
going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to raise additional
capital and implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company
is unable to continue as a going concern.
Management believes that
actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity for the Company to
continue as a going concern.

Our cash balance was $61,845 and $57,497 as of

31, 2022, and $81,147 for the nine month period ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
We believe we can satisfy our cash requirements
for the next 12 months. We anticipate that our fixed costs made up of legal & accounting and general & administrative expenses
for the next 12 months will total approximately $25,000. Legal and accounting expenses of $20,000 represents the minimum funds needed
to sustain operations. The $25,000 will be financed through the Company’s cash balance of $61,845, additional financing, net sales,
and if needed, an advance from our directors, Lauren Bentley and Jordan Starkman. Currently there is no firm loan commitment between
the Company and Lauren Bentley and Jordan Starkman in place. We do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any significant equipment. We
also do not expect any significant additions to the number of employees, until financing is raised.  The foregoing represents
our best estimate of our cash needs based on our current business condition.  The exact allocation, purposes and timing of any
monies raised in subsequent private financings may vary significantly depending upon the exact amount of funds raised and our progress
with the execution of our business plan.  It is currently expected that the Company will spend an additional $250,000 in variable
costs relating to marketing and business development that will be funded from future financings.
We expect our expenses will continue to increase
during the foreseeable future as a result of increased operations, the production of our swimwear, and marketing expenses for our business
operations.  We anticipate generating revenues once the brand is launched within the next six months. The success of our operations
is dependent on attaining adequate revenue. We cannot assure investors that adequate revenues will be generated. In the absence of our
projected revenues, we may be unable to proceed with our plan of operations.  Even without adequate revenues within the next
12 months, we still anticipate being able to continue with our present activities, but we may require financing to achieve our profit,
revenue, and growth goals.
12
In the event we are not successful in reaching
our initial revenue targets, additional funds may be required, and we may not be able to proceed with our business plan for the development
and marketing of our core services. Should this occur, we would likely seek additional financing to support the continued operation of
our business. We anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations, we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable
future. Therefore, our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Consequently, we
are dependent on the proceeds from future debt or equity investments to sustain our operations and implement our business plan.
If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will be required to delay or forego some portion of our business plan, which would have
a material adverse effect on our anticipated results from operations and financial condition.  There is no assurance that we will
be able to obtain necessary amounts of capital or that our estimates of our capital requirements will prove to be accurate.
The Company is currently seeking funding for our
continued operations.  The Company intends to raise a minimum of $400,000 and a maximum of $1,000,000 in order to expand the
introduction of the
www.laurenbentleyswim.com
e-commerce site to the retail community and fashion world. The Company expects to
launch the site mid 2023. To achieve our goals the Company expects to commit the majority of its funding to production of the swimwear
lines, and to the advertising of the Company’s web site. There is no assurance that the company will be able to raise the capital
required to complete its goal and objectives and the Company is currently seeking capital to further its business plan.  Any
capital raised will be through either a private placement or a convertible debenture and will result in the issuance of common shares
from the Company’s authorized capital.  There are no agreements with any parties at this point in time for additional
funding; however, we are in preliminary discussions with various funders in the US.
We presently do not have any significant credit
available, bank financing or other external sources of liquidity.  Due to our operating losses, our operations have not been a source
of liquidity.  We will need to obtain additional capital in order to expand operations and become profitable.  In order to obtain
capital, we may need to sell additional shares of our common stock or borrow funds from private lenders.  There can be no assurance
that we will be successful in obtaining additional funding.
To the extent that we raise additional capital
through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to existing stockholders.
If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior
to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. Regardless of whether our cash assets
prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs, we may seek to compensate providers of services by issuance of stock in lieu of
cash, which may also result in dilution to existing shareholders. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that
we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements
that would force us to seek alternative financing.
No assurance can be given that sources
of financing will be available to us and/or that demand for our equity/debt instruments will be sufficient to meet our capital needs,
or that financing will be available on terms favorable to us. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we may not be able
to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or may be required to reduce the scope of our planned
marketing efforts and development of various swimwear styles, any of which could have a negative impact on our business and operating
results. In addition, insufficient funding may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, which could require us to: 1)
Limit the production of a select swimwear designs, 2) Seek strategic partnerships that may force us to relinquish control of the Company,
or 3) Explore potential mergers or sales of significant assets of our Company.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
As explained in note 5 to the condensed financial
statements, the Company evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements issued and determined that the adoption of these pronouncements
would not have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
13
Seasonality
The swimwear industry in North America is seasonal
however, we do not expect our sales to be dramatically impacted by seasonal demands for our products and services since our market is
worldwide.

Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
The Securities and Exchange Commission defines
the term “disclosure controls and procedures” to mean the company’s controls and other procedures of an issuer that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The Company maintains such a simple system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required
to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified under the SEC’s rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated
to principal executive and principal financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.
As of the end of the period covered by this report,
we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance
of achieving the objectives of timely alerting them to material information required to be included in our periodic SEC reports and of
ensuring that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported with the time periods specified. Our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period
covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of these objectives.
