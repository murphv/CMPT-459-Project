PUBLIC COMPANY MANAGEMENT CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 –
NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY
OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Business
Public Company Management Corporation
("Company”), a Nevada corporation, was formed on October 26, 2000. On October 1, 2004, MyOffiz, Inc. ("MyOffiz")
entered into an Exchange Agreement with the certain controlling shareholders of GoPublicToday.com,
Inc., Pubco WhitePapers, Inc., and Public Company Management Services, Inc. The Company was the holding company for, and conducted its
operations through, its subsidiary companies. The term "we" and "our" refers to the Company and its subsidiaries unless
otherwise stated.
Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement,
MyOffiz acquired approximately
92.1 % of the outstanding shares of GoPublicToday.com, Inc., all
of the outstanding shares of Pubco WhitePapers, Inc., and all of the outstanding shares of Public Company Management Services, Inc in
exchange for the new issuance of an aggregate of
15,326,650
of MyOffiz's common stock. Subsequent to the Exchange Agreement, MyOffiz obtained
100% of the partially owned subsidiaries, changed its fiscal year end from June 30 to September 30, and changed its name to Public Company
Management Corporation.
The Company was a management consulting
firm that educated and assisted small businesses to improve their management, corporate governance, regulatory compliance, and other business
processes, with a focus on capital market participation. The Company offered the following services to its clients at various stages of
the business lifecycle:
· Educational products to
improve business processes or explore entering the capital markets;
· Startup consulting to
early-stage companies planning for growth;
· Management consulting
to companies seeking to enter the capital markets via self-underwriting or direct public offering or to move from one capital market to
another; and
· Compliance services to
fully reporting, publicly traded companies.
The Company generated revenues primarily
from consulting services that it provided to private company clients seeking to become fully reporting, publicly traded companies. The
Company also generated revenue from regulatory compliance services that the Company was providing to public company clients that are required
to file periodic and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Company would be paid a flat fee
for these services, which generally consisted of cash and restricted shares of the Company’s clients’ common stock.
Predicated upon the economic recession
of 2008, commencing with the subprime mortgage crisis and bank crisis, a significant increase in housing foreclosures ultimately caused
the stock market to crash in September 2008. At that time, and prior, the Company faced competition from a large number of consulting
firms, investment banks, venture capitalists, merchant banks, financial advisors, and other similar management consulting and regulatory
compliance services firms. Due to (i) the inability to raise funds in the marketplace and (ii) the intense competition in every aspect
of the Company’s business, the Company was unable to operate profitably.
Basis of Preparation
The accompanying financial statements include
the financial information of PCMC Holdings Inc. (“PCMC”, the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with
the instructions to financial reporting as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The preparation
of these financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
In the opinion of management, the financial statements contained in this report include all known accruals and adjustments necessary for
a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods reported herein.
6
Adoption of New Accounting Standard
PCMC adopted Accounting Standard Update 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers, at the start of the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and recorded
a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings based on the current terms and conditions for open contracts as of January 1, 2019.
The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Financial Statements. The comparative information has
not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-3,
Financial
Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instructions
(ASU 2016-13), which requires
measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-3 is effective for us in our first quarter of
fiscal 2023, and earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our financial
statements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures
of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are primarily used in our revenue recognition, long-lived asset impairments
and adjustments, deferred tax, stock-based compensation, and reserves for legal matters.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
PCMC considers all highly liquid investments purchased
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
to employees in accordance with ASC 718 requiring employee equity awards to be accounted for under the fair value method. Accordingly,
share-based compensation is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite
employee service period. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to other than employees in accordance with ASU 2019-07 Equity
instruments issued to other than employees are valued at the earlier of a commitment date or upon completion of the services, based on
the fair value of the equity instruments and is recognized as expense over the service period. The Company estimates the fair value of
share-based payments using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for common stock options and the closing price of the company’s
common stock for common share issuances.
Revenue Recognition
The core principles of revenue
recognition under ASC 606 include the following five criteria:
1.
Identify the contract with the customer
Contract with our customers may be oral, written, or implied. A written and signed invoice stating the terms and conditions is the Company’ preferred method. The terms of a written contract may be contained within the body of an invoice or in an email. No work is commenced without an understanding between the Company and our client that a valid contract exists.
2.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract
Our sales and account management teams define the scope of services to be offered, to ensure all parties are in agreement and obligations are being delivered to the customer as promised. The performance obligation may not be fully identified in a mutually signed contract, but may be outlined in email correspondence, face-to-face meetings, additional proposals or scopes of work, or phone conversations.
7
3.
Determine the transaction price
Pricing is discussed and identified by the operations team prior to submitting an invoice to the customer.
4.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
If a contract involves multiple obligations, the transaction pricing is allocated accordingly, during the performance obligation phase.
5.
Recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation
The Company uses digital marketing that includes
digital advertising, SEO management and digital ad support. We provide whether presenting a vibrant but simple message about our clients
that will enlighten their audience or deploying an influential digital marketing campaign on our online site or across one or multiple
social media platforms. Revenue is recognized when ads are run on Company’s advertising platform.
The company generates analytical reports monthly
or as required to show how the ad dollars were spent and how the targeting resulted in click-through. The report satisfies the performance
obligation, regardless of the outcome or effectiveness of the campaign.
Sales are recognized when promised services are
started in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Sales for service
contracts generally are recognized as the services are being provided.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts
The Company establishes an allowance for bad debts
through a review of several factors including historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, and financial
condition of our customers. The Company does not generally require collateral for our accounts receivable. There were
no
accounts receivable
and allowance for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.
General and Administrative Expenses
PCMC’s general and administrative expenses
consisted of the following types of expenses during 2022 and 2021: Compensation expense, payroll expense, rent, travel and entertainment,
legal and accounting, utilities, web sites, office expenses, depreciation and other administrative related expenses.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at the cost
of acquisition or construction and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Costs associated with repair and maintenance
are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with improvements which extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the efficiency of
our property and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the related asset. Gains and losses on dispositions
of equipment are reflected in operations. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews the carrying value of its
long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical-cost carrying value of an asset
may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the asset by comparing the undiscounted future net cash flows expected
to result from the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows of the asset, an
impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value
of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined based on either expected future cash flows at a rate we believe incorporates the time
value of money. No indications of impairments were identified in 2022 or 2021.

When an entity has a net loss, it is prohibited
from including potential common shares in the computation of diluted per share amounts. Accordingly, we have utilized basic shares outstanding
to calculate both basic and diluted loss per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The number of potential anti-dilutive
shares excluded from the calculation shares for the period ended December 31, 2022 is zero
0 .
Income Taxes
Uncertain tax position
The Company also follows the guidance related
to accounting for income tax uncertainties. In accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company recognizes the financial statement
benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following
an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest
benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. No liability
for unrecognized tax benefits was recorded as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The ASC guidance for fair value measurements and
disclosure establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level 1 Inputs
– Quoted
prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2 Inputs
– Quoted
prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and
model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
Level 3 Inputs
– Instruments
with primarily unobservable value drivers. The Company has no Level 3 Inputs.
The Company’s financial instruments consist
of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and debt. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due
either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial
statements.
9
Related Party Transactions
The Company follows ASC 850,
Related
Party Disclosures , for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. Related party note and
interest balances as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 were $ 415,654
and $ 413,029 , respectively and related party accrued liabilities
as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 of $ 32,164
and $ 32,164 , respectively (see Note 4. Related Party Transactions).
Research and Development
The Company spent

since its inception and had a working capital deficit of $ 468,683

NOTE 7 –
INCOME TAXES
The Company follows ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. During 2009,
there was a change in control of the Company. Under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code such a change in control negates much of
the tax loss carry forward and deferred income tax. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes,
and (b) net operating loss carry forwards. For federal income tax purposes, the Company uses the accrual basis of accounting, the same
that is used for financial reporting purposes.
11
As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company's accumulated
deficit was $ 5,522,699
and $ 5,515,035
respectively. Only $ 66,147
of this deficit will offset income in the future since all prior net
operating loss deductions are disallowed upon a change of control or if the Company does not continue in the same line of business for
two years following the year of change.
Federal income tax returns have not been examined and reported upon
by the Internal Revenue Service; returns of the years since September 30, 2019 are still open.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The Company has evaluated subsequent events as
of the date of the financial statements were available to be issued and has determined that there are no disclosable subsequent events.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Management’s Plan of Operation.
The following discussion contains forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements
by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use of words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,”
“expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” and other words and terms
of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. From time to time, the Company also
may provide forward-looking statements in other materials that we release to the public.
Overview.
The Company’s current business objective
is to seek a business combination with an operating company. The Company intend to use our limited personnel and financial resources in
connection with such activities. We will utilize our capital stock, debt or a combination of capital stock and debt, in effecting a business
combination. It may be expected that entering into a business combination will involve the issuance of restricted shares of capital stock.
The issuance of additional shares of our capital stock may significantly reduce the equity interest of our shareholders, will likely cause
a change in control if a substantial number of our shares of capital stock are issued, and most likely will also result in the resignation
or removal of our present officer and director and may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.
If we issued debt securities, it could result
in default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination were insufficient to pay our debt obligations,
acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we have made all principal and interest payments when due if the debt
security contained covenants that required the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves and any such covenants were breached
without a waiver or renegotiations of such covenants, our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt
security was payable on demand, and our inability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, if the debt security contained covenants
restricting our ability to obtain additional financing while such security was outstanding.
Going Concern.
The Company’s reviewed financial
statements for the Three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the audited financial statements for the years ended September
30, 2021 and 2022, were prepared using the assumption that we will continue our operations as a going concern. Our independent
accountants in their audit report had expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our operations
are dependent on our ability to raise sufficient capital or complete business combination as a result of which we become profitable.
Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The Company had not generated any
revenues during the period ended December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. The Company had total operating expenses of $5,039 during
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and total operating expenses of $ 26,213 in the year ended September 30, 2022. The Company
incurred $2,625 interest expense for the Three months ending Dec 31, 2022 and 2021. During the
three months ended December 31, 2022 and year ended September 30, 2022, the Company had a net loss of $7,664 and $ 36,713
respectively.
The Company had not generated any
revenues during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The Company had total operating expenses of $400 for the three months ended
December 31, 2021 and $5,039 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The Company incurred $ 2,625 interest expense for the
three months ended December 31, 2022 and $2,625 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
During the three months ended December 31,
2022 and the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company had a net loss of $ 7,664 and $ 3,025 respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources.
As of December 31, 2022 and through the
date hereof, the Company has no business operations and limited cash resources other than that provided by Repository Services LLC. We
are dependent upon interim funding to be provided by Repository Services LLC or Specialty Capital Lenders LLC to pay professional fees
and expenses. If the Company require additional financing, the Company cannot predict whether equity or debt financing will become available
at terms acceptable to us, if at all. Repository Services LLC has agreed to provide funding as may be required to pay for accounting fees
and other administrative expenses of the Company until the Company enters into a business combination. The Company would be unable to
continue as a going concern without interim financing provided by Repository Services LLC.
13
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had
cash of $ 3,406 and as of September 30, 2022, the Company had $ 4,448 cash.
The Company had a negative cash flow
from operations of $ 2,240 during the year ended September 30, 2022 and a negative cash flow from operations during the quarter
ended December 31, 2022 of $ 1,042 due to a net loss of $ 7,664
The Company does not currently engage in
any business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations, maintaining the filing
of Exchange Act reports, the investigation, analyzing, and consummation of an acquisition for an unlimited period of time will be paid
from additional money lent to the Company by Repository Services LLC.
The Company currently plans to satisfy its
cash requirements for the next twelve months through its cash on hand and borrowings from Repository Services LLC or Specialty Capital
Lenders LLC or entities or individuals affiliated with either and believes it can satisfy its cash requirements so long as the Company
are able to obtain financing from these parties. The Company expects that money borrowed will be used during the next twelve months to
satisfy the Company’s operating costs, professional fees and for general corporate purposes.
During the next twelve months, we anticipate
incurring costs related to filing of Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, reports, franchise fees, transfer agent fees, registered
agent fees, legal fees, accounting fees, and investigating, analyzing, and consummating an acquisition or business combination. The Company
estimates that these costs will be in the range of ten to twelve thousand dollars per year, and that the Company will be able to meet
these costs as necessary with funds to be advanced or loaned to us by Repository Services LLC and/or Specialty Capital Lenders LLC.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company was
obligated to Specialty Capital Lenders LLC for $ 350,000, with accrued interest of $ 66,654 , for a total of $ 416,654 evidenced by a
note. As of the date hereof, the maturity date of the note was extended to August 31, 2023
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.
As of September 30, 2022 and 2020, December
31,, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Not Applicable.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Internal control over financial reporting
refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and to be effected
by the Board of Directors and management (solely Patrick McMahon), to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and includes those policies and procedures that:
(a)       Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
(b)       Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management
and directors; and
14
(c)       Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of our assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Internal control over financial reporting
cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. It is a process that
involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. It also can
be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
Because of such limitations, there is a
risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However,
these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process
certain safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
Management is and will be responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. To assist and because of lack of personnel, current
management has engaged an outside certified public accountant to assist in the financial reporting. We have been informed that our outside
certified public accountant has used various frameworks to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
Based upon this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective for the reported
then quarter ended.
Our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) have been designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in
our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,, such as this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.
Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management
and our Chief Executive Officer - Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Patrick McMahon with the assistance of our
outside certified public accountant has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. The Company
cause to perform this evaluation on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures can be reported in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to conclude on the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures
as at the end of the quarter covered by the report.
The Company's disclosure controls and procedures
may not have been effective prior to our engaging an auditing firm and our preparation for the filing of our General Form for Registration
of Securities of Small Business Issuers under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on Form 10 on June 1, 2022, as the
Company was not required to address management’s assessment of disclosures controls and procedures. As that time, we instituted
new reporting and approval procedures that have remediated any potential material weaknesses and the Company further concluded that our
internal controls over financial reporting was effective. We are taking additional measures to enhance the ability of our systems of disclosure
controls and procedures to timely identify and respond to any federal or state substantive changes that are applicable to us.
Changes in Internal Controls.
There were no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
