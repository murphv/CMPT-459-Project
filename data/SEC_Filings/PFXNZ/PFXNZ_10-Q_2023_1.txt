Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)
Note 1.
Organization
PhenixFIN
Corporation (“PhenixFIN.” the “Company,” “we” and “us”) is an internally-managed non-diversified
closed end management investment company incorporated in Delaware that has elected to be regulated as a business development company
(“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). We completed our initial public
offering (“IPO”) and commenced operations on January 20, 2011. The Company has elected, and intends to qualify annually,
to be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). On November 18, 2020, the board of directors of the Company approved
the adoption of an internalized management structure, effective January 1, 2021. Until close of business on December 31, 2020 we were
externally managed and advised by MCC Advisors LLC (“MCC Advisors”), pursuant to an investment management agreement. MCC
Advisors is a wholly owned subsidiary of Medley LLC, which is controlled by Medley Management Inc. (OTCM: MDLM), a publicly traded asset
management firm, which in turn is controlled by Medley Group LLC, an entity wholly owned by the senior professionals
of Medley LLC. We use the term “Medley” to refer collectively to the activities and operations of Medley Capital LLC, Medley
LLC, MDLY, Medley Group LLC, MCC Advisors, associated investment funds and their respective affiliates. Since January 1, 2021 the Company
has been managed pursuant to an internalized management structure.
The
Company has formed and expects to continue to form certain taxable subsidiaries (the “Taxable Subsidiaries”), which are taxed
as corporations for federal income tax purposes. These Taxable Subsidiaries allow us to, among other things, hold equity securities of
portfolio companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements of a RIC under the Code.
The
Company’s investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation. The management team seeks to achieve this
objective primarily through making loans, private equity or other investments in privately-held companies. The Company may also make
debt, equity or other investments in publicly-traded companies. (These investments may also include investments in other BDCs, closed-end
funds or REITs.) We may also pursue other strategic opportunities and invest in other assets or operate other businesses to achieve our
investment objective, such as operating and managing an asset-based lending business. The portfolio generally consists of senior secured
first lien term loans, senior secured second lien term loans, senior secured bonds, preferred equity and common equity. Occasionally,
we will receive warrants or other equity participation features which we believe will have the potential to increase total investment
returns. Our loan and other debt investments are primarily rated below investment grade or are unrated. Investments in below investment
grade securities are considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal
when due.
Since January 4, 2021, the common stock trades
on the NASDAQ Global Market under the trading symbol “PFX.”

financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) and include the consolidated accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries PhenixFIN Small Business
Fund, LP (“PhenixFIN Small Business Fund”) and PhenixFIN SLF Funding I LLC (“PhenixFIN SLF”), and its wholly
owned Taxable Subsidiaries. All references made to the “Company,” “we,” and “us” herein include PhenixFIN
Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, except as stated otherwise. Additionally, the accompanying consolidated financial statements
of the Company and related financial information have been prepared pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K and Article
10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act of 1933.  In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements reflect
all adjustments and reclassifications, which are of a normal recurring nature, that are necessary for the fair presentation of financial
results as of and for the periods presented. Therefore, this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022. The current period’s results of operations will not necessarily be indicative
of results that ultimately may be achieved for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023.
Use
of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash,
Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers cash equivalents to be highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents
include deposits in a money market account. The Company deposits its cash in financial institutions and, at times, such balances may
be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, we had $ 17.7
million and $ 22.8
million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively, none of which is restricted.
Debt
Issuance Costs
Debt
issuance costs, incurred in connection with any credit facilities and unsecured notes (see Note 5) are deferred and amortized over the
life of the respective credit facility or instrument.
Indemnification
In
the normal course of business, the Company enters into contractual agreements that provide general indemnifications against losses, costs,
claims and liabilities arising from the performance of individual obligations under such agreements. The Company has had no material
claims or payments pursuant to such agreements. The Company’s individual maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown,
as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Company that have not yet occurred. However, based on management’s
experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.
Revenue
Recognition
Interest
income, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is recorded on an accrual basis. Dividend income, which represents
dividends from equity investments and distributions from Taxable Subsidiaries, is recorded on the ex-dividend date and when the distribution
is received, respectively.
The
Company holds debt investments in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest provision. PIK interest,
which represents contractually deferred interest added to the investment balance that is generally due at maturity, is recorded on the
accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. PIK interest is not accrued if the Company does not expect the
issuer to be able to pay all principal and interest when due. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company earned
approximately $ 0.2
million and $ 0.2
million in PIK interest, respectively.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Origination/closing,
amendment and transaction break-up fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are recognized as income when we become entitled
to such fees. Prepayment penalties received by the Company for debt instruments paid back to the Company prior to the maturity date are
recorded as income upon repayment of debt. Administrative agent fees received by the Company are capitalized as deferred revenue and
recorded as fee income when the services are rendered. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, fee income was approximately
$ 0.1
million, and $ 0.3
million, respectively (see Note 9).
Investment
transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between
the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously
recognized. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, $ 0.0
million and $( 19.6 ) million of the Company’s realized
losses were related to certain non-cash restructuring transactions, which are recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as
a component of net realized gain/(loss) from investments. The Company reports changes in fair value of investments as a component of
the net unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Management
reviews all loans that become 90 days or more past due on principal or interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest
will be collected for possible placement on management’s designation of non-accrual status. Interest receivable is analyzed regularly
and may be reserved against when deemed not collectible. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income
or applied to principal depending upon management’s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual
status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management’s judgment, are likely to remain current, although we may
make exceptions to this general rule if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. At December 31,
2022, certain investments in 5 portfolio companies held by the Company were on non-accrual status with a combined fair value of approximately
$ 5.4
million, or
2.9 % of the fair value of our portfolio. At September 30, 2022, certain investments in five portfolio companies held
by the Company were on non-accrual status with a combined fair value of approximately $ 5.2
million, or
2.7 % of the fair value of our
portfolio.
Investment
Classification
The
Company classifies its investments in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, we would be deemed to “control”
a portfolio company if we owned more than
25 % of its outstanding voting securities and/or had the power to exercise control over the
management or policies of such portfolio company. We refer to such investments in portfolio companies that we “control” as
“Control Investments.” Under the 1940 Act, we would be deemed to be an “Affiliated Person” of a portfolio company
if we own between
5 % and
25 % of the portfolio company’s outstanding voting securities or we are under common control with such
portfolio company. We refer to such investments in Affiliated Persons as “Affiliated Investments.”
Valuation
of Investments
The
Company applies fair value accounting to all of its financial instruments in accordance with the 1940 Act and ASC Topic 820 - Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework used to measure fair value
and requires disclosures for fair value measurements. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized its financial instruments
carried at fair value, based on the priority of the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note
4. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument
rather than an entity specific measure. Therefore, when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company’s own assumptions
are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement
date.
Investments
for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations, which are generally obtained from an independent
pricing service or multiple broker-dealers or market makers. We weight the use of third-party broker quotations, if any, in determining
fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote
was an indicative price or binding offer. However, debt investments with remaining maturities within 60 days that are not credit impaired
are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates fair value. Investments for which market quotations
are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined by our Chief Financial Officer, the Company’s Valuation Designee,
based upon input from management and third-party valuation firms. Because these investments are illiquid and because there may not be
any directly comparable companies whose financial instruments have observable market values, these loans are valued using a fundamental
valuation methodology, consistent with traditional asset pricing standards, that is objective and consistently applied across all loans
and through time.
Investments
in investment funds are valued at fair value. Fair values are generally determined utilizing the NAV supplied by, or on behalf of, management
of each investment fund, which is net of management and incentive fees or allocations charged by the investment fund and is in accordance
with the “practical expedient”, as defined by FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2009-12,
Investments
in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share . NAVs received by, or on behalf of, management of each investment fund
are based on the fair value of the investment funds’ underlying investments in accordance with policies established by management
of each investment fund, as described in each of their financial statements and offering memorandum. If the Company is in the process
of the sale of an investment fund, fair value will be determined by actual or estimated sale proceeds.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
The
methodologies utilized by the Company in estimating the fair value of its investments categorized as Level 3 generally fall into the
following two categories:
●
The “Market Approach”
uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable (that is, similar)
assets, liabilities, or a group of assets and liabilities, such as a business.
●
The “Income Approach”
converts future amounts (for example, cash flows or income and expenses) to a single current (that is, discounted) amount. When the
Income Approach is used, the fair value measurement reflects current market expectations about those future amounts.
The
Company has engaged third-party valuation firms (the “Valuation Firms”) to assist it and its Valuation Designee (the Chief
Financial Officer) in the valuation of its portfolio investments. The valuation reports generated by the Valuation Firms consider the
evaluation of financing and sale transactions with third parties, expected cash flows and market-based information, including comparable
transactions, performance multiples, and movement in yields of debt instruments, among other factors. The Company uses a market yield
analysis under the Income Approach or an enterprise model of valuation under the Market Approach, or a combination thereof. In applying
the market yield analysis, the value of the Company’s loans is determined based upon inputs such as the coupon rate, current market
yield, interest rate spreads of similar securities, the stated value of the loan, and the length to maturity. In applying the enterprise
model, the Company uses a waterfall analysis, which takes into account the specific capital structure of the borrower and the related
seniority of the instruments within the borrower’s capital structure into consideration. To estimate the enterprise value of the
portfolio company, we weigh some or all of the traditional market valuation methods and factors based on the individual circumstances
of the portfolio company in order to estimate the enterprise value.
The
methodologies and information that the Company utilizes when applying the Market Approach for performing investments include, among other
things:
●
valuations of comparable
public companies (“Guideline Comparable Approach”);
●
recent sales of private
and public comparable companies (“Guideline Comparable Approach”);
●
recent acquisition prices
of the company, debt securities or equity securities (“Recent Arms-Length Transaction”);
●
external valuations of
the portfolio company, offers from third parties to buy the company (“Estimated Sales Proceeds Approach”);
●
subsequent sales made by
the company of its investments (“Expected Sales Proceeds Approach”); and
●
estimating the value to
potential buyers.
The
methodologies and information that the Company utilizes when applying the Income Approach for performing investments include:
●
discounting the forecasted
cash flows of the portfolio company or securities (Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) Approach); and
●
Black-Scholes model or
simulation models or a combination thereof (Income Approach - Option Model) with respect to the valuation of warrants.
For
non-performing investments, we may estimate the liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company’s assets and liabilities
using an expected recovery model (Market Approach - Expected Recovery Analysis or Estimated Liquidation Proceeds).
We
undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter when valuing investments for which market quotations are not readily available,
as described below:
●
our quarterly valuation
process generally begins with each portfolio investment being internally valued by a Valuation Firm;
●
Available third-party market
data will be reviewed by company personnel designated by the Valuation Designee (“Fair Value Personnel”) and the Valuation
Firm.
●
Available portfolio company
data and general industry data are then reviewed by the Fair Value Personnel.
●
Preliminary valuation conclusions
are then documented and discussed with the Fair Value Personnel.
●
The Valuation Designee
then determines the fair value of each investment in the Company’s portfolio in good faith based on such discussions, the Company’s
Valuation Policy and the Valuation Firms’ final estimated valuations.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Due
to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair
value of our investments may differ from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments,
and the differences could be material. In addition, changes in the market environment (including the impact of COVID-19 on financial
markets), portfolio company performance, and other events may occur over the lives of the investments that may cause the gains or losses
ultimately realized on these investments
to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned.
Fair Value
of Financial Instruments
The
carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses,
approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying amounts and fair values of our long-term obligations are discussed
in Note 5.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference
rate reform (Topic 848)—Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.” The amendments in this
update provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to certain contracts and hedging relationships that reference
LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform and became effective upon issuance for all entities.
The Company has agreements that have LIBOR as a reference rate with certain portfolio companies and also with certain lenders. Many of
these agreements include language for choosing an alternative successor rate if LIBOR reference is no longer considered to be appropriate.
Contract modifications are required to be evaluated in determining whether the modifications result in the establishment of new contracts
or the continuation of existing contracts. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, “Reference rate reform (Topic 848),”
which expanded the scope of Topic 848. ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 are effective through December 31, 2022 when the Company plans to
apply the amendments in this update to account for contract modifications due to changes in reference rates. On Dec. 21, 2022, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new Accounting Standards Update ASU 2022-06, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral
of the Sunset Date of Topic 848,” that extends the sunset (or expiration) date of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic
848 to Dec. 31, 2024. This gives reporting entities two additional years to apply the accounting relief provided under ASC Topic 848
for matters related to reference rate reform. The ASU is effective immediately. The Company has adopted ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 and
there is no material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
Federal
Income Taxes
The
Company has elected, and intends to qualify annually, to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to continue to
qualify as a RIC and be eligible for tax treatment under Subchapter M of the Code, among other things, the Company is required to meet
certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders at least
90 % of the sum of
investment company taxable income (“ICTI”), as defined by the Code, including PIK interest, and net tax exempt interest income
(which is the excess of gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for each taxable year. Depending on the
level of ICTI earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year dividend distributions into
the next tax year. Any such carryover ICTI must be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior
to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such ICTI.
The
Company is subject to a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax of
4 % on undistributed income if it does not distribute at least
98 % of
its ordinary income in any calendar year and
98.2 % of its capital gain net income for each one-year period ending on October 31 of such
calendar year and any income realized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which it did not pay federal income tax. To the
extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year
dividend distributions for excise tax purposes, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable
income is earned. There was no provision for federal excise tax at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
The
Company’s Taxable Subsidiaries accrue income taxes payable based on the applicable corporate rates on the unrealized gains generated
by the investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company did not record a deferred
tax liability on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The change in provision for deferred taxes is included as a component
of net realized and unrealized gain/(loss) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the three months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record a change in provision for deferred taxes on the unrealized (appreciation)/depreciation
on investments.
As
of December 31, 2022 and September 30 2022, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $ 26.3
million and $ 26.2
million, respectively,
consisting primarily of net operating losses and net unrealized losses on the investments held within its Taxable Subsidiaries. As
of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company has booked a valuation allowance of $ 26.3
million and $ 26.2
million,
respectively, against its deferred tax asset.

Note 2.
Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
ICTI
generally differs from net investment income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition
of income and expenses. The Company may be required to recognize ICTI in certain circumstances in which it does not receive cash. For
example, if the Company holds debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount, the Company
must include in ICTI each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether
cash representing such income is received by the Company in the same taxable year. The Company may also have to include in ICTI other
amounts that it has not yet received in cash, such as 1) PIK interest income and 2) interest income from investments that have been classified
as non-accrual for financial reporting purposes. Interest income on non-accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting
purposes, but generally is recognized in ICTI. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in the Company’s
ICTI for the year of accrual, the Company may be required to make a distribution to its stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum
distribution requirements, even though the Company will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount. ICTI
also excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they
are realized.
The
Company accounts for income taxes in conformity with ASC Topic 740 - Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). ASC 740 provides guidelines
for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in financial statements. ASC 740 requires the
evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company’s tax returns to determine whether
the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to
meet a “more-likely-than-not” threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. The Company
recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. There were no material uncertain income tax positions at December 31, 2022. Although we file federal and state tax
returns, our major tax jurisdiction is federal. The Company’s federal and state tax returns for the prior three fiscal years remain
open, subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and applicable state tax authorities.
Segments
The
Company invests in various industries. The Company separately evaluates the performance of each of its investment relationships. However,
because each of these investment relationships has similar business and economic characteristics, they have been aggregated into a single
investment segment. All applicable segment disclosures are included in or can be derived from the Company’s financial statements.
See Note 3 for further information.
Company
Investment Risk, Concentration of Credit Risk, and Liquidity Risk
The
Company has broad discretion in making investments. Investments generally consist of debt instruments that may be affected by business,
financial market or legal uncertainties. Prices of investments may be volatile, and a variety of factors that are inherently difficult
to predict, such as domestic or international economic and political developments, may significantly affect the results of the Company’s
activities and the value of its investments. In addition, the value of the Company’s portfolio may fluctuate as the general level
of interest rates fluctuate.
The
value of the Company’s investments in loans may be detrimentally affected to the extent, among other things, that a borrower defaults
on its obligations, there is insufficient collateral and/or there are extensive legal and other costs incurred in collecting on a defaulted
loan, observable secondary or primary market yields for similar instruments issued by comparable companies increase materially or risk
premiums required in the market between smaller companies, such as our borrowers, and those for which market yields are observable increase
materially.
The
Company’s assets may, at any time, include securities and other financial instruments or obligations that are illiquid or thinly
traded, making purchase or sale of such securities and financial instruments at desired prices or in desired quantities difficult. Furthermore,
the sale of any such investments may be possible only at substantial discounts, and it may be extremely difficult to value any such investments
accurately.
Company
performance (including that of certain of its portfolio companies) has been and may continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic’s effects. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted economies and capital markets around the world in ways that may
continue and may change in unforeseen ways for an indeterminate period. The pandemic has also adversely affected various businesses,
including some in which we are invested. The COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate pre-existing business performance, political, social and
economic risks affecting certain companies and countries generally. The impacts, as well as the uncertainty over impacts to come, of
COVID-19 have adversely affected the performance of the Company (including certain portfolio companies) and may continue to do so in
the future. Further, the potential exists for additional variants of COVID-19 to impede the global economic recovery and exacerbate geographic
differences in the spread of, and response to, COVID-19.

4. Fair Value Measurements
The
Company follows ASC 820 for measuring the fair value of portfolio investments. Fair value is the price that would be received in the
sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where
available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable
prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of management estimation
and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments’ complexity.
The Company’s fair value analysis includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Financial investments recorded
at fair value in the consolidated financial statements are categorized for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated
with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation
of the investment as of the measurement date. Investments which are valued using NAV as a practical expedient are excluded from this
hierarchy, and certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The three levels are
defined below:
●
Level 1 - Valuations based
on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
●
Level 2 - Valuations based
on inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable at the
measurement date. This category includes quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical
or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets including actionable bids from third parties for privately held assets or
liabilities, and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as yield curves and forward currency rates that are entered directly
into valuation models to determine the value of derivatives or other assets or liabilities.
●
Level 3 - Valuations based
on inputs that are unobservable and where there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. The inputs for the determination
of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation and are based upon management’s assessment of the assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. These investments include debt and equity investments in
private companies or assets valued using the Market or Income Approach and may involve pricing models whose inputs require significant
judgment or estimation because of the absence of any meaningful current market data for identical or similar investments. The inputs
in these valuations may include, but are not limited to, capitalization and discount rates, beta and EBITDA multiples. The information
may also include pricing information or broker quotes which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price
in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing and/or quotes accompanied by disclaimer would result in classification
as Level 3 information, assuming no additional corroborating evidence.
In
addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Company continues to employ a valuation policy approved by the board
of directors that is consistent with ASC 820 (see Note 2). Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including
any markets in which our investments are trading, in determining fair value.

(1) FlexFIN,
LLC was reclassed as an Equity from Secured Debt during the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
Net change in unrealized gain (loss) for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 included in earnings related to investments still held as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately
$ 2.3
million and $( 10.3 ) million, respectively.
Purchases
and other adjustments to cost include purchases of new investments at cost, effects of refinancing/restructuring, accretion/amortization
of income from discount/premium on debt securities, and PIK.
Sales
represent net proceeds received from investments sold.
A
review of the fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation
inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities.
Reclassifications impacting Level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy are reported as transfers in/out of the Level 3 category as of the beginning of the quarter in which the
reclassifications occur. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, no investments were transferred out of
Level 3 and one investment was transferred into Level 3. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, one of our investments
transferred out of Level 3 and no investments transferred into Level 3.

The
significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s debt and derivative investments are market
yields. Increases in market yields would result in lower fair value measurements.
The
significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s equity/warrants investments are comparable
company multiples of revenue or EBITDA for the latest twelve months (“LTM”), next twelve months (“NTM”) or a
reasonable period a market participant would consider. Increases in EBITDA multiples in isolation would result in higher fair value measurement.
In
September 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Global Accessories Group, LLC (“Global Accessories”), in which
the Company exchanged its full position in Lydell Jewelry Design Studio, LLC for a
3.8 % membership interest in Global Accessories, which
is included in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. As part of the agreement, the Company is entitled to contingent consideration
in the form of cash payments (“Earnout”), as well as up to an additional
5 % membership interest (“AMI”), provided
Global Accessories achieves certain financial benchmarks through calendar year ended 2022. The Earnout and AMI were initially recorded
with an aggregate fair value of $ 2.4
million on the transaction date using the Income Approach and were included on the Consolidated
Statements of Assets and Liabilities in other assets. The contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date
until the contingency is resolved. Any changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30,
2022, the Company deemed the contingent consideration to be uncollectible.

5. Borrowings
As
a BDC, we are generally only allowed to employ leverage to the extent that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at
least
200 % after giving effect to such leverage. The amount of leverage that we employ at any time depends on our assessment of the market
and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.
However,
in March 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage
it may incur from
200 % to
150 %, if certain requirements under the 1940 Act are met. Under the 1940 Act, we are allowed to increase our
leverage capacity if stockholders representing at least a majority of the votes cast, when a quorum is present, approve a proposal to
do so. If we receive stockholder approval, we would be allowed to increase our leverage capacity on the first day after such approval.
Alternatively, the 1940 Act allows the majority of our independent directors to approve an increase in our leverage capacity, and such
approval would become effective after the one-year anniversary of such approval. In either case, we would be required to make certain
disclosures on our website and in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the receipt of approval to increase our leverage, our leverage
capacity and usage, and risks related to leverage.
As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022,
the Company’s asset coverage was
259.7 % and

customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. The Credit Facility contains customary events of default
for credit facilities of this type, including (without limitation): nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts after a
stated grace period; inaccuracy of material representations and warranties; change of control; violations of covenants, subject in certain
cases to stated cure periods; and certain bankruptcies and liquidations. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Company
may be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility.

Value of Debt Obligations
The
fair values of our debt obligations are determined in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value in terms of the price that would
be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions.
The fair value of the Notes, which are publicly traded, is based upon closing market quotes as of the measurement date. As of December
31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Notes would be deemed to be Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as defined in Note 4.

Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan
On
May 9, 2022, the board of directors of the Company adopted the PhenixFIN 2022 Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan (the “CIP”) pursuant
to the recommendation by the Compensation Committee of the board of directors. The CIP provides for performance-based cash awards to
key employees of the Company, as approved by the Compensation Committee, based on the achievement of pre-established financial goals
for the approved performance period. The performance goals may be expressed as one or a combination of net asset value of the Company,
net asset value per share of the Company’s common stock, changes in the market price of shares of the Company’s common stock,
individual performance metrics and/or such other goals and objectives the Committee considers relevant in connection with accomplishing
the purposes of the CIP.
In
connection with the approval of the CIP, the Compensation Committee in April 2022, approved awards for the three year performance period
commencing on January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2024. Each participant is eligible to receive an amount of cash equal to
0 %- 200 %
of the target award set forth in the table below (“Target Performance Award”), based on the achievement of net asset value
(“NAV”) and NAV per share goals (weighted at
30 % and
70 %, respectively) as of the end of the performance period (the “Performance
Goals”). Performance is evaluated separately for each Performance Goal. No payment is made with respect to a Performance Goal if
a threshold level of performance is not achieved. Each Performance Goal is subject to (i) a threshold level of performance at which a
percentage of the Target Performance Award attributable to that Performance Goal may be paid and below which no payment is made pursuant
to an Award, (ii) a target level of performance at which
100 % of the Target Performance Award attributable to that Performance Goal may
be paid and (iii) a maximum level of performance, at which
200 % of the Target Performance Award attributable to that Performance Goal
may be paid, in each case subject to such other terms and conditions of an Award. Between threshold, target and maximum performance levels
for each Performance Goal, the portion of that Award attributed to the Performance Goal shall be interpolated in a linear progression.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022,
no
accrual was recorded for these awards.

13. Dividends
Dividends
and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined
by our board of directors.
We
have adopted an “opt out” dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend
or other distribution, each stockholder that has not “opted out” of our dividend reinvestment plan will have its dividends
automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash dividends. Stockholders who receive distributions
in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash
distributions.
The
Company did not make any distribution payments during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Note
15. Subsequent Events
Management
has evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements included herein. Other than the
items disclosed herein, there have been no subsequent events that occurred during such period that would require disclosure in this Form
10-Q or would be required to be recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three months ended December 31,
2022.
Under
the share repurchase program, the Company repurchased an aggregate o f
2,252

On
February 8, 2023, the Board of Directors approved the expansion of the amount authorized for repurchase under the Company’s share
repurchase program from $ 25
million to $ 35
million. Since announcing this share repurchase program on January 11, 2021, the Company has
repurchased an aggregate of
627,137
shares of common stock through February 7, 2023 with a total cost of approximately $ 24.9

COVID-19
Developments and War in Ukraine
COVID-19
and variants thereof have severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial
markets. The global impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve and many countries, including the United States, have reacted at various stages
of the pandemic by instituting quarantines, restricting travel, and temporarily closing or limiting capacity at many corporate offices,
retail stores, restaurants, fitness clubs and manufacturing facilities and factories in affected jurisdictions. Such actions have created
disruption in global supply chains and adversely impacted a number of industries. The outbreak has had and could continue to have an
adverse impact on economic and market conditions and trigger a period of global economic slowdown.
We
continue to closely monitor the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business, including how it will impact our portfolio
companies, employees, due diligence and underwriting processes, and financial markets. Given the continuing development and fluidity
of this situation, we cannot estimate the long-term impact of COVID-19 on our business, future results of operations, financial position
or cash flows at this time. Further, the operational and financial performance of the portfolio companies in which we make investments
may be significantly impacted by COVID-19, which may in turn impact the valuation of our investments. We believe our portfolio companies
have taken actions to effectively and efficiently respond to the challenges posed by COVID-19 and related orders imposed by state and
local governments, including developing liquidity plans supported by internal cash reserves, shareholder support, and, as appropriate,
accessing their ability to participate in the government Paycheck Protection Program. The Company’s performance has been negatively
impacted during the pandemic. The longer-term impact of COVID-19 on the operations and the performance of the Company (including certain
portfolio companies) is difficult to predict, but may also be adverse. The longer-term potential impact on such operations and performance
could depend to a large extent on future developments and actions taken by authorities and other entities to mitigate COVID-19 and its
economic impact. The impacts, as well as the uncertainty over impacts to come, of COVID-19 have adversely affected the performance of
the Company (including certain portfolio companies) and may continue to do so in the future. Furthermore, the impacts of a potential
worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remain unknown. COVID-19
presents material uncertainty and risks with respect to the underlying value of the Company’s portfolio companies, the Company’s
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, such as the potential negative impact to financing arrangements,
increased costs of operations, changes in law and/or regulation, and uncertainty regarding government and regulatory policy.
In
February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. The extent and duration of Russian military action in the Ukraine,
resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in stock markets in Russia and elsewhere and the value
of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but have been and could continue to be significant. Any such disruptions
caused by Russian military or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting from actual or threatened responses to
such actions have caused and could continue to cause disruptions to portfolio companies located in Europe or that have substantial business
relationships with European or Russian companies. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions
are impossible to predict, but have been and could continue to be substantial. Any such market disruptions could affect our portfolio
companies’ operations and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
We
have evaluated subsequent events from December 31, 2022 through the filing date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. However, as the
discussion in this Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to the
Company’s financial statements for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2022, the analysis contained herein may not fully account
for market event impacts. As of December 31, 2022, the Company valued its portfolio investments in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”) based on the facts and circumstances known by the Company at that time, or reasonably expected
to be known at that time. Due to the overall volatility that market events may have caused during the months following our most recent
valuation (as of December 31, 2022), any valuations conducted now or in the future in conformity with U.S. GAAP could result in a lower
fair value of our portfolio. The longer-term impact of COVID-19 and other market events on the operations and the performance of the
Company (including certain portfolio companies) is difficult to predict, but may also be adverse. Further, the potential exists for additional
variants of COVID-19 to adversely effect the global economy.
53
Overview
We
are an internally-managed non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the
1940 Act. In addition, we have elected, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under
Subchapter M of the Code. Through December 31, 2020, we were an externally managed company. On November 18, 2020, the board of directors
of the Company approved the adoption of an internalized management structure, effective January 1, 2021. Since January 1, 2021, we have
operated under such internalized management structure.
We
commenced operations and completed our initial public offering on January 20, 2011. Under our internalized management structure, our
activities are managed by our senior professionals and are supervised by our board of directors, of which a majority of the members are
independent of us.
The
Company’s investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation. The management team seeks to achieve this
objective primarily through making loans, private equity or other investments in privately-held companies. The Company may also make
debt, equity or other investments in publicly-traded companies. (These investments may also include investments in other BDCs, closed-end
funds or REITS.) We may also pursue other strategic opportunities and invest in other assets or operate other businesses to achieve our
investment objective (such as our asset-based lending business). The portfolio generally consists of senior secured first lien term loans,
senior secured second lien term loans, senior secured bonds, preferred equity and common equity. Occasionally, we will receive warrants
or other equity participation features which we believe will have the potential to increase total investment returns. Our loan and other
debt investments are primarily rated below investment grade or are unrated. Investments in below investment grade securities are considered
predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal when due.
As
a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our
total assets in “qualifying assets,” including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents,
U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. In addition, we are only allowed to borrow
money such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% (or 150% if, pursuant to the 1940 Act, certain requirements
are met) after such borrowing, with certain limited exceptions. To maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must meet specified source-of-income
and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must timely distribute at least 90% of our
net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, for the taxable
year.
Reverse
Stock Split; Authorized Share Reduction
At
the Company’s 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 30, 2020 (the “Annual Meeting”), stockholders approved
a proposal to grant discretionary authority to the Company’s board of directors to amend the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation
(the “Certificate of Incorporation”) to effect a reverse stock split of its common stock, of 1-20 (the “Reverse Stock
Split”) and with the Reverse Stock Split to be effective at such time and date, if at all, as determined by the board of directors,
but not later than 60 days after stockholder approval thereof and, if and when the reverse stock split is effected, reduce the number
of authorized shares of common stock by the approved reverse stock split ratio (the “Authorized Share Reduction”).
Following
the Annual Meeting, on July 7, 2020, the board of directors determined that it was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders
to implement the Reverse Stock Split and the Authorized Share Reduction. Accordingly, on July 13, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate
of Amendment (the “Certificate of Amendment”) to the Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware to effect the Reverse Stock Split and the Authorized Share Reduction.
Pursuant
to the Certificate of Amendment, effective as of 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on July 24, 2020 (the “Effective Time”), each twenty
(20) shares of common stock issued and outstanding, immediately prior to the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on
the part of the respective holders thereof, were combined and converted into one (1) share of common stock. In connection with the Reverse
Stock Split, the Certificate of Amendment provided for a reduction in the number of authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000
to 5,000,000 shares of common stock. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, any stockholder
who would have been entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the Reverse Stock Split received cash payments in lieu of such
fractional shares (without interest and subject to backup withholding and applicable withholding taxes).
On
December 21, 2020, the Company announced that it completed the application process for and was authorized to transfer the listing of
its shares of common stock to the NASDAQ Global Market. The listing and trading of the common stock on the NYSE ceased at the close of
trading on December 31, 2020. Since January 4, 2021, the common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Market under the trading symbol “PFX.”
54
Revenues
We
generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt that we hold and capital gains, if any, on warrants or other equity interests
that we may acquire in portfolio companies. We invest our assets primarily in privately held companies with enterprise or asset values
between $25 million and $250 million and generally focus on investment sizes of $10 million to $50 million. We believe that pursuing
opportunities of this size offers several benefits including reduced competition, a larger investment opportunity set and the ability
to minimize the impact of financial intermediaries. We expect our debt investments to bear interest at either a fixed or floating rate.
Interest on debt will be payable generally either monthly or quarterly. In some cases our debt investments may provide for a portion
of the interest to be PIK. To the extent interest is PIK, it will be payable through the increase of the principal amount of the obligation
by the amount of interest due on the then-outstanding aggregate principal amount of such obligation. The principal amount of the debt
and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form
of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance or investment management services
and possibly consulting fees. Any such fees will be recognized as earned.
Expenses
In
periods prior to December 31, 2020, our primary operating expenses included management and incentive fees pursuant to the investment
management agreement we had with MCC Advisors and overhead expenses, including our allocable portion of our administrator’s overhead
under the administration agreement, which were paid during the quarter ended March 31, 2021. Our management and incentive fees compensated
MCC Advisors for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. On November 18, 2020, the
board of directors adopted an internally managed structure, effective January 1, 2021, under which we bear all costs and expenses of
our operations and transactions, including those relating to:
●
our organization and continued corporate existence;
●
calculating our NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms);
●
expenses incurred in monitoring our financial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies;
●
interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments;
●
the costs of all offerings of common stock and other securities, if any;
●
operating costs associated with employing investment professionals and other staff;
●
distributions on our shares;
●
administration fees payable under our administration agreement;
●
Custodial fees related to our assets
●
amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments;
●
transfer agent and custodial fees;
●
registration fees and listing fees;
●
U.S. federal, state and local taxes;
●
independent director fees and expenses;
●
costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the SEC or other regulators;
●
the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders, including printing costs;
●
our fidelity bond;
●
directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;
●
the operating lease of our office space;
●
indemnification payments; and
●
direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit and legal costs.

2022
Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan
On
May 9, 2022, the board of directors of the Company adopted the PhenixFIN 2022 Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan (the “CIP”) pursuant
to the recommendation by the Compensation Committee of the board of directors. The CIP provides for performance-based cash awards to
key employees of the Company, as approved by the Compensation Committee, based on the achievement of pre-established financial goals
for the approved performance period. The performance goals may be expressed as one or a combination of net asset value of the Company,
net asset value per share of the Company’s common stock, changes in the market price of shares of the Company’s common stock,
individual performance metrics and/or such other goals and objectives the Committee considers relevant in connection with accomplishing
the purposes of the CIP. A form of Award Agreement to be used under the CIP was also approved.
In
connection with the approval of the CIP, the Compensation Committee in April 2022 approved awards for the executive officers named in
the table below for the three year performance period commencing on January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2024. Each participant
is eligible to receive an amount of cash equal to 0%-200% of the target award set forth in the table below (“Target Performance
Award”), based on the achievement of net asset value (“NAV”) and NAV per share goals (weighted at 30% and 70%, respectively)
as of the end of the performance period (the “Performance Goals”). Performance is evaluated separately for each Performance
Goal. No payment is made with respect to a Performance Goal if a threshold level of performance is not achieved. Each Performance Goal
is subject to (i) a threshold level of performance at which a percentage of the Target Performance Award attributable to that Performance
Goal may be paid and below which no payment is made pursuant to an Award, (ii) a target level of performance at which 100% of the Target
Performance Award attributable to that Performance Goal may be paid and (iii) a maximum level of performance, at which 200% of the Target
Performance Award attributable to that Performance Goal may be paid, in each case subject to such other terms and conditions of an Award.
Between threshold, target and maximum performance levels for each Performance Goal, the portion of that Award attributed to the Performance
Goal shall be interpolated in a linear progression. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, no accrual was recorded for these
awards.
56
The Target
Performance Award for each executive officer is set forth in the table below:
Name and Title
Dollar Value
of Target
Award
David Lorber, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
$ 890,000
Ellida McMillan, Chief Financial Officer

In
December 2022, pursuant to the CIP, the Compensation Committee approved awards for Mr. Lorber and Ms. McMillan for the three-year performance
period commencing on January 1, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2025. Each participant is eligible to receive an amount of cash equal
to a percentage of the target award amount set forth above based on the factors described above. The Compensation Committee, in approving
the awards, evaluated each Performance Goal separately.
Portfolio
and Investment Activity
As
of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, our portfolio had a fair market value of approximately $183.3 million and $193.0 million,
respectively.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, we received proceeds from sale and settlements of investments of $19.2 million, including principal
and dividend proceeds, realized net losses on investments of $0.01 million, and invested $6.9 million.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2021, we received proceeds from sale and settlements of investments of $77.6 million, including principal
and dividend proceeds, realized net gain (losses) on investments of $15.2 million, and invested $96.2 million, of which $37.7 million
was invested in nine new portfolio companies during the quarter.

As
of December 31, 2022, our income-bearing investment portfolio based upon cost represented 62.5% of our total portfolio of which 81.6%
bore interest based on floating rates, such as the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) or the Secured Overnight Financing
Rate (“SOFR”), while 18.4% bore interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a weighted average yield
of 11.3% on debt and other income producing investments. This yield does not represent the total return to our stockholders.
We
rate the risk profile of each of our investments based on the following categories:
Credit
Rating
Definition
1
Investments that are performing above expectations.
2
Investments that are performing within expectations, with risks that are neutral or favorable compared to risks at the time of origination. All new loans are rated ’2’.
3
Investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of interest, dividend or principal is expected. Companies rated ’3’ may be out of compliance with financial covenants, however, loan payments are generally not past due.
4
Investments that are performing below expectations and for which risk has increased materially since origination. Some loss of interest or dividend is expected but no loss of principal. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due).
5
Investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Some loss of principal is expected.

Interest
and Financing Expenses
Interest
and financing expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $0.3 million, or 17.1%, compared to the three months
ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in interest and financing expenses was primarily due to the partial repayment of the 2023 Notes
on December 16, 2021 and the lower interest rate from the issuance of the 2028 Notes which became effective on November 16, 2021.

Professional
Fees and General and Administrative Expenses
Professional
fees and general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were comparable to the three months ended December
31, 2021.
Net
Realized Gains/Losses from Investments
We
measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of an investment,
without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $0.01 million of realized gains on our portfolio investments.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $15.2 million of realized gains on our portfolio investments. The realized gains
were primarily due to the restructuring of three investments.
Realized
loss on extinguishment of debt
In
the event that we modify or extinguish our debt prior to maturity, we account for it in accordance with ASC 470-50, Modifications and
Extinguishments, in which we measure the difference between the reacquisition price of the debt and the net carrying amount of the debt,
which includes any unamortized debt issuance costs.
Net
Unrealized Appreciation/Depreciation on Investments
Net
change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments reflects the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, we had $2.3 million of net unrealized appreciation on investments. The net unrealized appreciation
was comprised of $2.9 million of net unrealized depreciation on investments and $5.2 million of net unrealized appreciation that resulted
from the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on investments that were realized, partially sold, or written-off during
the year.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2021, we had $10.3 million of net unrealized depreciation on investments. The net unrealized depreciation
was comprised of $10.4 million of net unrealized depreciation on investments and $0.1 million of net unrealized appreciation that resulted
from the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on investments that were realized, partially sold, or written-off during
the year.
Provision
for Deferred Taxes on Unrealized Depreciation on Investments
Certain
consolidated subsidiaries of ours are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated
with the Company for income tax purposes, but are consolidated for GAAP purposes, and may generate income tax liabilities or assets from
temporary differences in the recognition of items for financial reporting and income tax purposes at the subsidiaries. For the three
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record a change in provision for deferred taxes on the unrealized (appreciation)/depreciation
on investments.
Changes
in Net Assets from Operations
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $4.0 million compared
to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $4.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This increase
takes into account increased net income and net capital appreciation for the period, each as described above. Based on 2,100,876 and
2,517,221 weighted average common shares outstanding for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, our per share
net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $1.88 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and $1.91 for the three months
ended December 31, 2021.
61
Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
As
a RIC, we distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders and have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for
investment purposes. To fund growth, we have a number of alternatives available to increase capital, including raising equity, increasing
debt, and funding from operational cash flow.
Our
liquidity and capital resources historically have been generated primarily from the net proceeds of public offerings of common stock,
advances from the Revolving Credit Facility (which the Company voluntarily satisfied and terminated) and net proceeds from the issuance
of notes as well as cash flows from operations. In the future, we may generate cash from future offerings of securities, future borrowings
and cash flows from operations, including interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities and other
high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. Our primary use of funds is investments in our targeted asset classes,
cash distributions to our stockholders, and other general corporate purposes.
As
of December 31, 2022, we had $17.7 million in cash and cash equivalents.
In
order to maintain our RIC tax treatment under the Code, we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our taxable
income, but we may also elect to periodically spill over certain excess undistributed taxable income from one tax year into the next
tax year. In addition, as a BDC, for each taxable year we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior
securities, which include borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200% (or 150% if, pursuant to the
1940 Act, certain requirements are met). This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow.
On
January 11, 2021, the Company announced that its board of directors approved a share repurchase program. On February 9, 2022, the Board
of Directors approved the expansion of the amount authorized for repurchase under the Company’s share repurchase program from $15
million to $25 million. Under the share repurchase program, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 624,885 shares of common stock through
December 31, 2022, or 22.9% of shares outstanding as of the program’s inception, with a total cost of $24.8 million. Taking into
account such prior repurchases, the total remaining amount authorized under the expanded share repurchase program at December 31, 2022
was approximately $0.2 million.
Credit
Facility
On
December 15, 2022, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries executed a three-year, $50 million revolving credit facility (the
“Credit Facility”) with WoodForest Bank, N.A. (“WoodForest”), Valley National Bank, and Axiom Bank,
(collectively, the “Lenders”). WoodForest is the administrative agent, sole bookrunner and sole lead arranger. As of
December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings by the Company under the Credit Facility.
Outstanding
loans under the Credit Facility will bear a monthly interest rate at Term SOFR + 2.90%. The Company is also subject to a commitment fee
of 0.25%, which shall accrue on the actual daily amount of the undrawn portion of the revolving credit. The Credit Facility contains
customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. The Credit Facility contains customary events of default
for credit facilities of this type, including (without limitation): nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts after a
stated grace period; inaccuracy of material representations and warranties; change of control; violations of covenants, subject in certain
cases to stated cure periods; and certain bankruptcies and liquidations. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Company
may be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility.

Unsecured
Notes
2023
Notes
On
March 18, 2013, the Company issued $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes. As of March 30, 2016, the 2023 Notes may
be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company’s option. On March 26, 2013, the Company closed
an additional $3.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes, pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters’ option
to purchase additional notes. The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per year, payable quarterly on March 30, June 30, September
30 and December 30 of each year, beginning June 30, 2013.
On
December 12, 2016, the Company entered into an “At-The-Market” (“ATM”) debt distribution agreement with FBR Capital
Markets & Co., through which the Company could offer for sale, from time to time, up to $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount
of the 2023 Notes. The Company sold 1,573,872 of the 2023 Notes at an average price of $25.03 per note, and raised $38.6 million in net
proceeds, through the ATM debt distribution agreement.
On
March 10, 2018, the Company redeemed $13.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes. The redemption was accounted for
as a debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments, which resulted in a realized loss of $0.3
million and was recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a loss on extinguishment of debt.
On
December 31, 2018, the Company redeemed $12.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes. The redemption was accounted for
as a debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments, which resulted in a realized loss of $0.2
million and was recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a loss on extinguishment of debt.
On
December 21, 2020, the Company announced that it completed the application process for and was authorized to transfer the listing of
the 2023 Notes to the NASDAQ Global Market. The listing and trading of the 2023 Notes on the NYSE ceased at the close of trading on December
31, 2020. Effective January 4, 2021, the 2023 Notes trade on the NASDAQ Global Market under the trading symbol “PFXNL.”
On
November 15, 2021, the Company caused notices to be issued to the holders of the 2023 Notes regarding the Company’s exercise of
its option to redeem $55,325,000 in aggregate principal amount of the issued and outstanding 2023 Notes on December 16, 2021. The redemption
was accounted for as a debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments, which resulted in a realized
loss of $0.3 million and was recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a loss on extinguishment of debt.
On
December 15, 2022, the Company caused notices to be issued to the holders of its 2023 Notes regarding the Company’s exercise of
its option to redeem $22,521,800 in aggregate principal amount of issued and outstanding 2023 Notes, comprising all issued and outstanding
2023 Notes, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon from September
30, 2022, through, but excluding, January 17, 2023 in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 2023 Notes. The Company
expects the redemption to be completed on January 17, 2023. The Company intends to fund the redemption of the 2023 Notes with loans obtained
under the Credit Facility, as described earlier in this section. See also “Subsequent Events.”
63
2028
Notes
On
November 9, 2021, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement, by and between the Company and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., as representative
of the several underwriters named in Exhibit A thereto, in connection with the issuance and sale (the “Offering”) of $57,500,000
(including the underwriters’ option to purchase up to $7,500,000 aggregate principal amount) in aggregate principal amount of its
5.25% Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”). The Offering occurred on November 15, 2021, pursuant to the Company’s effective
shelf registration statement on Form N-2 previously filed with the SEC, as supplemented by a preliminary prospectus supplement dated
November 8, 2021, the pricing term sheet dated November 9, 2021 and a final prospectus supplement dated November 9, 2021. Effective November
16, 2021, the 2028 Notes began trading on the NASDAQ Global Market under the trading symbol “PFXNZ.”
On
November 15, 2021, the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee entered into a Fourth Supplemental Indenture to its base
Indenture, dated February 7, 2012, between the Company and the Trustee. The Fourth Supplemental Indenture relates to the Offering of
the 2028 Notes.
Contractual
Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As
of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, we had commitments under loan and financing agreements to fund up to $2.2 million to four
portfolio companies and $6.0 million to six portfolio companies, respectively. These commitments are primarily composed of senior
secured term loans and revolvers, and the determination of their fair value is included in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments.
The commitments are generally subject to the borrowers meeting certain criteria such as compliance with covenants and certain operational
metrics. The terms of the borrowings and financings subject to commitment are comparable to the terms of other loan and equity securities
in our portfolio. A summary of the composition of the unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 is shown in

64
Distributions
We
have elected, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.
As a RIC, in any taxable year with respect to which we timely distribute at least 90 percent of the sum of our (i) investment company
taxable income (which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net
long-term capital losses) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and (ii) net tax exempt interest income (which
is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions), we (but not our stockholders) generally will
not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders.
We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income, but we may also elect to periodically spill over certain excess
undistributed taxable income from one tax year to the next tax year. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment
company taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax. We may choose to retain our net capital gains or any investment
company taxable income, and pay the associated federal corporate income tax or excise tax, described below.
Amounts
not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S.
federal excise tax payable by us. To avoid this tax, we must distribute (or be deemed to have distributed) during each calendar year
an amount equal to the sum of:
1)
at least 98.0% of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year;
2)
at least 98.2% of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period ending on October 31st of the calendar year; and
3)
income realized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we did not pay federal income tax.
While
we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax,
sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of the tax. In that
event, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.
We
intend to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure you that we
will achieve investment results that will allow us to pay a specified level of dividends or year-to-year increases in dividends. In addition,
the inability to satisfy the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC could limit our ability to pay dividends. All dividends will
be paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, maintenance of our RIC
tax treatment, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time
to time. We cannot assure you that we will pay dividends to our stockholders in the future.
65
To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for a taxable year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.
We
have adopted an “opt out” dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend
or other distribution, each stockholder that has not “opted out” of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends
automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash dividends. Stockholders who receive distributions
in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash
distributions.
There
were no dividend distribution payments during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Related
Party Transactions
Concurrent
with the pricing of our IPO, we entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:
●
We entered into the Investment Management Agreement with MCC Advisors, which expired December 31, 2020. Mr. Brook Taube, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer through December 31, 2020 and director through January 21, 2021 and Mr. Seth Taube, director through January 21, 2021, are both affiliated with MCC Advisors and Medley.
●
Through December 31, 2020, MCC Advisors provided us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations pursuant to our administration agreement. We reimbursed MCC Advisors for the allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our board of directors) of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions, and our allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs.
66
On June 12, 2020, the Company entered into the Expense Support Agreement with MCC Advisors and Medley LLC, pursuant to which MCC Advisors and Medley LLC agreed (jointly and severally) to cap the management fee and all of the Company’s other operating expenses (except interest expenses, certain extraordinary strategic transaction and expenses, and other expenses approved by the Special Committee) at $667,000 per month (the “Cap”). Under the Expense Support Agreement, the Cap became effective on June 1, 2020 and was to expire on September 30, 2020. On September 29, 2020, the board of directors, including all of the independent directors, extended the term of the Expense Support Agreement through the end of quarter ending December 31, 2020. The Expense Support Agreement expired by its terms at the close of business on December 31, 2020, in connection with the adoption of the internalized management structure by the board of directors.
In
addition, we have adopted a formal business code of conduct and ethics that governs the conduct of our CEO, CFO, chief accounting officer
(which role is currently fulfilled by our CFO) and controller (Covered Officers). Our officers and directors also remain subject to the
duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires that all
Covered Officers promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between
an individual’s personal and professional relationships. Pursuant to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, each Covered Officer
must disclose to the Company’s CCO any conflicts of interest, or actions or relationships that might give rise to a conflict. Any
approvals or waivers under our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics must be considered by the disinterested directors.
Pledge
and Security Agreement
In
connection with the Credit Facility discussed in Note 5, the Company has entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement with the Lenders
pursuant to which the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries have pledged all their assets, including the cash and securities held
in the Company’s custodial account with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as collateral for any borrowings made by the Company
pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The Lenders have the typical rights and remedies of a secured lender under the Uniform Commercial Code,
including the right to foreclose on the collateral pledged by the Company.
Critical Accounting Policies
The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could
materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.
67
Valuation
of Portfolio Investments
The
Company follows ASC 820 for measuring the fair value of portfolio investments. Fair value is the price that would be received in the
sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where
available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable
prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of management estimation
and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments’ complexity.
The Company’s fair value analysis includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Financial investments recorded
at fair value in the consolidated financial statements are categorized for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated
with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation
of the investment as of the measurement date. Investments which are valued using NAV as a practical expedient are excluded from this
hierarchy, and certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The three levels are
defined below:
●
Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
●
Level 2 - Valuations based on inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable at the measurement date. This category includes quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets including actionable bids from third parties for privately held assets or liabilities, and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as yield curves and forward currency rates that are entered directly into valuation models to determine the value of derivatives or other assets or liabilities.
●
Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and where there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. The inputs for the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation and are based upon management’s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. These investments include debt and equity investments in private companies or assets valued using the Market or Income Approach and may involve pricing models whose inputs require significant judgment or estimation because of the absence of any meaningful current market data for identical or similar investments. The inputs in these valuations may include, but are not limited to, capitalization and discount rates, beta and EBITDA multiples. The information may also include pricing information or broker quotes which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing and/or quotes accompanied by disclaimer would result in classification as Level 3 information, assuming no additional corroborating evidence.
We
value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations, which are generally obtained from an
independent pricing service or multiple broker-dealers or market makers. We weight the use of third-party broker quotes, if any, in determining
fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote
was an indicative price or binding offer. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments
in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under
our valuation policy and process. We may seek pricing information with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or
brokers or dealers in order to value such investments.
68
Valuation
methods may include comparisons of financial ratios of the portfolio companies that issued such private equity securities to peer companies
that are public, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments and its earnings
and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and other relevant factors. When an external event
such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external
event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that
do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have
been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.
In
December 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which permits a BDC’s board of directors to designate its executive
officer(s) as a valuation designee to determine the fair value of its investment portfolio, subject to the oversight of the board. The
Board has approved policies and procedures pursuant to Rule 2a-5 and has designated Ellida McMillan, the Company’s CFO, to serve
as the Board’s valuation designee (“Valuation Designee”), subject to the Board’s oversight, effective September
8, 2022.
With
respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board oversees and our Valuation Designee undertakes
a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
●
Our quarterly valuation process generally begins with each investment being initially valued by a Valuation Firm.
● Available third-party market data will be reviewed by company personnel designated by the Valuation Designee (“Fair Value Personnel”) and the Valuation Firm.
● Available portfolio company data and general industry data is then reviewed by the Fair Value Personnel.
●
Preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with the Fair Value Personnel.
●
The Valuation Designee then determines the fair value of each investment in the Company’s portfolio in good faith based on such discussions, the Company’s Valuation Policy and the Valuation Firms’ final estimated valuations
In
following these approaches, the types of factors that are taken into account in fair value pricing investments include available current
market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables; applicable market yields and multiples; security
covenants; call protection provisions; information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company’s
ability to make payments; the portfolio company’s earnings and discounted cash flows; the markets in which the portfolio company
does business; comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public; comparable merger and acquisition transactions; and
the principal market and enterprise values.
Determination
of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates made by management. The notes to our financial statements refer to the uncertainty
with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated financial statements.

We account for investment transactions on a trade-date basis and interest income, adjusted for amortization
of premiums and accretion of discounts, is recorded on an accrual basis. For investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents
contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will not accrue PIK interest
if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not collectible. Origination, closing and/or commitment fees associated
with investments in portfolio companies are recognized as income when the investment transaction closes. Other fees are capitalized as
deferred revenue and recorded into income over the respective period. Prepayment penalties received by the Company for debt instruments
paid back to the Company prior to the maturity date are recorded as income upon receipt. Realized gains or losses on investments are
measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of investment, without regard to
unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We report changes in the fair value of investments that are measured at fair value
as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on investments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Non-accrual:
We place loans on non-accrual status when principal and interest payments are past due by 90 days or more, or when there is reasonable
doubt that we will collect principal or interest. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual. Interest
payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management’s judgment.
Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in our management’s judgment,
are likely to remain current. At December 31, 2022, certain investments in five portfolio companies held by the Company were on non-accrual
status with a combined fair value of approximately $5.4 million, or 2.9% of the fair value of our portfolio. At September 30, 2022, certain
investments in five portfolio companies held by the Company were on non-accrual status with a combined fair value of approximately $5.2
million, or 2.7% of the fair value of our portfolio.
Federal
Income Taxes
The
Company has elected, and intends to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M
of the Code and it intends to operate in a manner so as to maintain its RIC tax treatment. To do so, among other things, the Company
is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and must timely distribute to its stockholders at
least 90% of the sum of investment company taxable income (“ICTI”) including PIK, as defined by the Code, and net tax exempt
interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for each taxable year.
The Company will be subject to a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax of 4% on undistributed income if it does not distribute at least
98% of its net ordinary income for any calendar year and 98.2% of its capital gain net income for each one-year period ending on October
31 of such calendar year and any income realized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which it did not pay federal income
tax. Depending on the level of ICTI earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year dividend
distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that
its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions for excise tax purposes,
the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. Any such carryover ICTI must
be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year
which generated such ICTI.
70
Because
federal income tax requirements differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax requirements may differ from net investment income
and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are
reclassified among capital accounts in the consolidated financial statements to reflect their tax character. Temporary differences arise
when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. Differences in classification may also
result from the treatment of short-term gains as ordinary income for tax purposes.
Recent
Developments
On
January 17, 2023, the Company borrowed $23.2 million under the Credit Facility. Also on that date (the ” Full Redemption Date”)
and using the proceeds of such borrowings, the Company redeemed $22,521,800 in aggregate principal amount of the issued and outstanding
2023 Notes, comprising all issued and outstanding 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes were redeemed at 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest thereon from September 30, 2022, through, but excluding, the Full Redemption Date. The redemption will be accounted
for as a debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments.
On February 8, 2023, the Board of Directors
approved the expansion of the amount authorized for repurchase under the Company’s share repurchase program from $25 million to
$35 million. Since announcing this share repurchase program on January 11, 2021, the Company has repurchased an aggregate of 627,137 shares
of common stock through February 8, 2023 with a total cost of approximately $24.9 million, or 23.0% of shares outstanding as of the program’s inception. Taking into account
such prior repurchases, the total remaining amount authorized under the expanded share repurchase program is approximately $10.1 million.

3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We
are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding
and our interest income from portfolio investments and cash and cash equivalents. Our investment income will be affected by changes in
various interest rates, including LIBOR and SOFR, to the extent our debt investments include floating interest rates. In the future,
we expect other loans in our portfolio will have floating interest rates. In addition, U.S. and global capital markets and credit markets
have experienced a higher level of stress due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in an increase in the level of volatility
across such markets. We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and
forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we did not engage in hedging
activities.
As
of December 31, 2022, 79.0% of our income-bearing investment portfolio bore interest based on floating rates based upon fair value. A
prolonged reduction in interest rates will reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income
if such decreases in LIBOR, SOFR or similar reference rates are not offset by a corresponding increase in the spread over LIBOR, SOFR
or similar reference rates that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in our operating expenses, including with respect to
any income incentive fee, or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities tied to LIBOR, SOFR or similar
reference rates. In contrast, a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable
to any variable rate investments we hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we hold. In addition, a rise in interest
rates may increase the likelihood that a portfolio company defaults on a loan. However, many of our variable rate investments provide
for an interest rate floor, which may prevent our interest income from increasing until benchmark interest rates increase beyond a threshold
amount. The composition of our floating rate debt investments by cash interest rate LIBOR and SOFR floor as of December 31, 2022 was
as follows (dollars in thousands):

4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. The term “disclosure controls and procedures” is defined under
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended. Based on the evaluation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Changes
in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred
during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
controls over financial reporting.

Item
1. Legal Proceedings
From
time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of our business. Our businesses
are also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. Except as described below, we are not
currently party to any material legal proceedings.
Item
1A. Risk Factors
In
addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the “Risk Factors” discussed in our
annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on December 16, 2022, which could materially
affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Other than the items disclosed below, there have been no material
changes during the three months ended December 31, 2022 to the risk factors discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our annual
report on Form 10-K. Additional risks or uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may
materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
Risks
Related to our Business
We
may not be able to pay you distributions and our distributions may not grow over time.
When
possible, we may pay quarterly distributions to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure you
that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to pay a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in
cash distributions. Our ability to pay distributions might be adversely affected by, among other things, the impact of one or more of
the risk factors described herein. In addition, the inability to satisfy the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC could limit
our ability to pay distributions. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s asset coverage was 259.7% after giving effect to leverage
and therefore the Company’s asset coverage is above 200%, the minimum asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act. All distributions
will be paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, maintenance of our
RIC tax treatment, compliance with applicable BDC regulations, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from
time to time. We cannot assure you that we will pay distributions to our stockholders in the future.
Risks
Related to our Operations as a BDC and RIC
Regulations
governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital which could have a material
adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
Our
business requires a substantial amount of capital to operate and grow. We may acquire additional capital from the issuance of senior
securities (including debt and preferred stock), the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or from securitization transactions.
However, we may not be able to raise additional capital in the future on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, we may only issue senior
securities up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act permits us to issue senior securities only in amounts such
that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% (or 150% if, pursuant to the 1940 Act, certain requirements
are met) after such issuance or incurrence. If our assets decline in value and we fail to satisfy this test, we may be required to liquidate
a portion of our investments and repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales or repayment may be disadvantageous, which
could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s
asset coverage was 259.7% after giving effect to leverage and therefore the Company’s asset coverage is above 200%, the minimum
asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act.
73
Risks
Relating to an Investment in our Securities
The
indenture under which the 2028 Notes are issued place restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries’ activities.
The
terms of the indentures under which the 2028 Notes were issued place restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to, among
other things issue securities or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, including (1) any indebtedness or other
obligations that would be equal in right of payment to the 2028 Notes, (2) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be secured
and therefore rank effectively senior in right of payment to the 2028 Notes to the extent of the values of the assets securing such debt,
(3) indebtedness of ours that is guaranteed by one or more of our subsidiaries and which therefore is structurally senior to the 2028
Notes and  (4) securities, indebtedness or obligations issued or incurred by our subsidiaries that would be senior to our equity
interests in our subsidiaries and therefore rank structurally senior to the 2028 Notes, except as would cause our asset coverage to be
below 200% as a result of such borrowings and/or issuances, whether or not we continue to be subject to the regulations of the 1940 Act.
These provisions generally prohibit us from making additional borrowings, including through the issuance of additional debt or the sale
of additional debt securities, unless our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowings. As
of December 31, 2022, the Company’s asset coverage was 259.7% after giving effect to leverage. These provisions generally prohibit
us from declaring any cash dividend or distribution upon any class of our capital stock or purchasing any such capital stock if our asset
coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is below 200% at the time of the declaration of the dividend or distribution or the purchase and
after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase.
The
terms of the Credit Facility place restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries activities.
The
terms of the Credit Facility place restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, issue securities
or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, and in certain cases we may need the approval of Woodforest, as the
Administrative Agent, in order to incur further indebtedness. In addition, the Credit Facility contains customary events of default for
credit facilities of this type, including (without limitation): nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts after a stated
grace period; inaccuracy of material representations and warranties; change of control; violations of covenants, subject in certain cases
to stated cure periods; and certain bankruptcies and liquidations. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Company may be
required to repay all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility, which would adversely affect our liquidity position and, in turn,
could force us to dispose of investments at inopportune times at reduced prices. Repayment could also adversely affect our ability to
implement our investment strategy and achieve our investment objectives.
Certain
Risks in the Current Environment
We
are currently operating in a period of capital markets disruptions and economic uncertainty. Such market conditions may materially and
adversely affect debt and equity capital markets, which may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and operations.
From
time to time, capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability. The U.S. capital markets have experienced extreme
volatility and disruption following the global outbreak of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) that began in December 2019. Some economists
and major investment banks have expressed concern that the continued spread of the COVID-19 globally could lead to a world-wide economic
downturn. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy, as well as most other major economies, may continue to experience
a recession, and we anticipate our businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the United States
and other major markets. Disruptions in the capital markets have increased the spread between the yields realized on risk-free and higher
risk securities, resulting in illiquidity in parts of the capital markets.
The COVID-19 outbreak continues to have, and any future outbreaks
could have, an adverse impact on the ability of lenders to originate loans, the volume and type of loans originated, the ability of borrowers
to make payments and the volume and type of amendments and waivers granted to borrowers and remedial actions taken in the event of a
borrower default, each of which could negatively impact the amount and quality of loans available for investment by the Company and returns
to the Company, among other things.
With respect to the U.S. credit markets, the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in, and until fully resolved
is likely to continue to result in, the following among other things: (i) increased draws by borrowers on revolving lines of credit and
other financing instruments; (ii) increased requests by borrowers for amendments and waivers of their credit agreements to avoid default,
increased defaults by such borrowers and/or increased difficulty in obtaining refinancing at the maturity dates of their loans; (iii)
greater volatility in pricing and spreads and difficulty in valuing loans during periods of increased volatility; and rapidly evolving
proposals and/or actions by state and federal governments to address problems being experienced by the markets and by businesses and
the economy in general which will not necessarily adequately address the problems facing the loan market and businesses. These and future
market disruptions and/or illiquidity could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a
decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could limit our investment originations, limit our ability to grow and have
a material negative impact on our operating results and the fair values of our debt and equity investments. We may have to access, if
available, alternative markets for debt and equity capital, and a severe disruption in the global financial markets, deterioration in
credit and financing conditions or uncertainty regarding U.S. government spending and deficit levels or other global economic conditions
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
74
For
example, between 2008 and 2009, the U.S. and global capital markets were unstable as evidenced by periodic disruptions in liquidity in
the debt capital markets, significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated
credit market and the failure of major financial institutions. Despite actions of the U.S. federal government and foreign governments,
these events contributed to worsening general economic conditions that materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit
markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial services firms in particular.
Equity
capital may be difficult to raise during periods of adverse or volatile market conditions because, subject to some limited exceptions,
as a BDC, we are generally not able to issue additional shares of our common stock at a price less than NAV without first obtaining approval
for such issuance from our stockholders and our independent directors. Volatility and dislocation in the capital markets can also create
a challenging environment in which to raise or access debt capital. The current market and future market conditions similar to those
experienced from 2008 through 2009 for any substantial length of time could make it difficult to extend the maturity of or refinance
our existing indebtedness or obtain new indebtedness with similar terms and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect
on our business. The debt capital that will be available to us in the future, if at all, may be at a higher cost and on less favorable
terms and conditions than what we currently experience, including being at a higher cost in a rising interest rate environment. If any
of these conditions appear, they may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These events
could limit our investment originations, limit our ability to increase returns to equity holders through the effective use of leverage,
and negatively impact our operating results.
In
addition, significant changes or volatility in the capital markets may also have a negative effect on the valuations of our investments.
While most of our investments are not publicly traded, applicable accounting standards require us to assume as part of our valuation
process that our investments are sold in a principal market to market participants (even if we plan on holding an investment through
its maturity). Significant changes in the capital markets may also affect the pace of our investment activity and the potential for liquidity
events involving our investments. Thus, the illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell our investments to access
capital if required, and as a result, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments if
we were required to sell them for liquidity purposes. An inability to raise or access capital could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Governmental
authorities worldwide have taken increased measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The success of these measures
is unknown and they may not be sufficient to address the market dislocations or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity.
We
also face an increased risk of investor, creditor or portfolio company disputes, litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny
as a result of the effects of COVID-19 on economic and market conditions.
Events
outside of our control, including terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters or public health crises, could negatively affect
our portfolio companies and our results of our operations.
Periods
of market volatility have occurred and could continue to occur in response to pandemics or other events outside of our control, including
terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters, public health crises or similar events. These types of events have adversely affected
and could continue to adversely affect operating results for us and for our portfolio companies.
75
COVID-19
and variants thereof continue to adversely impact global commercial activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial
markets. Local, state and federal and numerous non-U.S. governmental authorities have imposed travel and hospitality restrictions and
bans, business closures or limited business operations and other quarantine measures on businesses and individuals. We cannot predict
the full impact of COVID-19, including the duration and the impact of the closures and restrictions described above. As a result, we
are unable to predict the duration of these business and supply-chain disruptions, the extent to which COVID-19 will negatively affect
our portfolio companies’ operating results or the impact that such disruptions may have on our results of operations and financial
condition. With respect to loans to portfolio companies, the Company will be impacted if, among other things, (i) amendments and waivers
are granted (or are required to be granted) to borrowers permitting deferral of loan payments or allowing for PIK interest payments,
(ii) borrowers default on their loans, are unable to refinance their loans at maturity, or go out of business, or (iii) the value of
loans held by the Company decreases as a result of such events and the uncertainty they cause. Portfolio companies may also be more likely
to seek to draw on unfunded commitments we have made, and the risk of being unable to fund such commitments is heightened during such
periods. Depending on the duration and extent of the disruption to the business operations of our portfolio companies, we expect some
portfolio companies, particularly those in vulnerable industries, to experience financial distress and possibly to default on their financial
obligations to us and/or their other capital providers. In addition, if such portfolio companies are subjected to prolonged and severe
financial distress, we expect some of them to substantially curtail their operations, defer capital expenditures and lay off workers.
These developments would be likely to permanently impair their businesses and result in a reduction in the value of our investments in
them.
The
Company will also be negatively affected if the operations and effectiveness of our portfolio companies (or any of the key personnel
or service providers of the foregoing) are compromised or if necessary or beneficial systems and processes are disrupted as a result
of stay-at-home orders or other related interruptions to business operations.
In
February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. The extent and duration of Russian military action in the Ukraine,
resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in stock markets in Russia and elsewhere and the value
of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but have been and could continue to be significant. Any such disruptions
caused by Russian military or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting from actual or threatened responses to
such actions have caused and could continue to cause disruptions to portfolio companies located in Europe or that have substantial business
relationships with European or Russian companies. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions
are impossible to predict, but have been and could continue to be substantial. Any such market disruptions could affect our portfolio
companies’ operations and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
We
may be subject to risks associated with significant investments in one or more economic sectors and/or industries, including the business
services sector, which includes our investment in our affiliate’s asset based lending business.
At
times, the Company may have a significant portion of its assets invested in securities of companies conducting business within one or
more economic sectors and/or industries, including the Services: Business, which includes our investment in an asset based lending business.
Companies in the same sector or industry may be similarly affected by economic, regulatory, political or market events or conditions,
which may make the Company more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that sector or industry than companies that invest more broadly.
Generally, the more broadly the Company invests, the more it spreads risk and potentially reduces the risks of loss and volatility.
76
As
of December 31, 2022, investments in our affiliate’s asset-based lending business constituted 17.9% of our total assets. Thus,
the Company presently has significant exposure to its asset based lending business. This asset based lending exposure subjects the Company
to the particular risks of such business to a greater degree than others not similarly concentrated. The Company’s affiliate’s
asset based lending activity within the gemstone and jewelry industry is exposed to factors that can impact price of gemstones and jewelry,
including supply and demand of gemstones; political, economic, and global financial events; movement of the U.S. dollar versus other
currencies; and the activity of large speculators and other participants. The gemstones and jewelry industry is exposed to the risk of
loss as a result of fraud in its various forms. A significant decline in market prices of gemstones could result in reduced collateral
value and losses, i.e., a lower balance of asset-based loans outstanding for the Company’s affiliate (which in turn would adversely
impact out net asset value). See Item 1A of our Form 10-K, filed December 16, 2022, for risk factors related to our investment in this
business.
