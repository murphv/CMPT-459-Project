PINEAPPLE,
INC.
NOTES
TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the Nine Months
Ended September
30, 2022
Note
1 –
Organization and Description of Business
Pineapple,
Inc. (“Pineapple” or the “Company”) was originally formed in the State of
Nevada
under the name Global
Resources, Ltd. on
August 3, 1983 . On April 12, 1999, the Company changed its name to “Helixphere Technologies Inc.”. On
September 19, 2013, the Company changed its name to “New China Global Inc.” On October 30, 2013, the Company filed its
Articles of Continuance with the Secretary of State of Wyoming pursuant to which the Company was re-domiciled from the State of
Nevada to the State of Wyoming. On July 15, 2014, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to change its name
from “New China Global Inc.” to “Globestar Industries”. On September 3, 2015, the Company changed its name
to “Pineapple Express, Inc.” from “Globestar Industries.” The Company’s name has no relation to the
2008 motion picture produced by Columbia Pictures. Currently, the Company is in the process of seeking regulatory approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(“FINRA”) to change its name to Pineapple, Inc.
On March 19, 2019, the Company entered
into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “PVI Agreement”) with Pineapple Ventures, Inc. (“PVI”), the Company’s
equity-method investment, and the stockholders of PVI (the “PVI Stockholders”) in which the Company acquired a total of  50 %  of
the outstanding shares of PVI, in consideration for  2,000,000  shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock may, from time to time, be converted by the holder into shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $ 0.0000001  (the
“Common Stock”), in an amount equal to ten ( 10 ) shares of Common Stock for each one share of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock. The PVI Stockholders elected to immediately convert the  2,000,000  shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into  20,000,000  shares
of common stock upon issuance.
8
On
January 17, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Jaime Ortega whereby in exchange for Mr. Ortega cancelling $ 1,062,000
of
existing loans extended to the Company by Jaime Ortega, Neu-Ventures, Inc., and Sky Island, Inc., the Company transferred to Mr. Ortega
10,000
shares of capital stock of PVI. Subsequently, on February 11, 2021, the parties entered into amended agreement pursuant to which
the original number of shares sold to Mr. Ortega was reduced from
10,000
shares of capital stock of PVI to
4,827
shares of capital stock
of PVI. Accordingly, the Company currently owns
45,173
shares of capital stock of PVI. This amendment was entered into to correct the
original agreement and properly reflect the value of the Company’s stock at the time of the initial agreement. As of September
30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company has a
45.17 %
ownership interest in PVI, its equity-method investment.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles accepted
in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). They
do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and, accordingly, certain information,
footnotes, and disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, have been condensed
or omitted in accordance with SEC rules and regulations. The accompanying financial information should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 6, 2022, and further amended and filed with the SEC on May 18, 2022. In the opinion
of management, the financial data presented includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations,
and cash flows for the periods presented. Results of interim periods should not be considered indicative of the results for the full
year. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include estimates and assumptions of management that affect the amounts
reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Basis
of Consolidation
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pineapple, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, THC Industries, LLC and
Pineapple Express Consulting, Inc., doing business as Pineapple Express. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
On
September 28 th , 2022, the Company signed a letter of intent with Jaime Ortega for the sale of 100% interest of Pineapple Park,
LLC (“PP”), in exchange for forgiveness of $ 10,000
of the existing note due to Ortega’s 100% owned entity,
Neu-Ventures, Inc. The Entity has accordingly been removed from the Company’s basis of consolidation consolidated financial statements,
which resulted in a decrease in the consolidated balance of accounts payable of $ 376,287
and a decrease in related party notes payable
of $ 10,000 . The sale of the Entity resulted in a gain of $ 386,287 , which has been recorded in the consolidated statement of operations
for the three- and nine- months ended September 30, 2022.

On
September 28 th , 2022, the Company signed a letter of intent with Mathew Feinstein, a related party and
8 %
owner of
Pineapple, Inc. and the current owner of Pineapple Wellness, Inc., (“PW”), for the purchase of PW, which also
includes the website
www.PineappleWellness.com
and the retail storefront at 8783 W. Pico Blvd., which will sell CBD products
and apparel when launched. Per the agreement, Feinstein will sell
100 %
interest
in the Entity in exchange for
2,500,000
shares
of Pineapple, Inc, (“PNPL”) to be issued by December 31, 2022, upon which the shares of the Entity shall transfer. There
is no impact to the financials for the nine-months ended September 30, 2022, as shares will be transferred in Q4 2022.
Use
of Estimates in Financial Reporting
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived
assets, assessment of legal accruals, the fair value of the Company’s stock, stock-based compensation and the valuation allowance
related to deferred tax assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company follows the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) for
disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. The FASB ASC establishes
a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The three
levels of fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level
1
Quoted
market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level
2
Pricing
inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the
reporting date.
Level
3
Pricing
inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar
techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.
The
carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, including cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and
other current liabilities, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of notes
payable approximates their fair values since the current interest rates and terms on these obligations are the same as prevailing market
rates.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment consist of furniture and fixtures and office equipment. They are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Expenditures for major renewals and
betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged
to expense as incurred.
The
estimated useful lives of the classes of property and equipment are as follows:

and fixtures

Investment
– Equity Method
The
Company accounts for its equity method investment (“PVI”) at cost, adjusted for the Company’s share of the
investee’s earnings or losses, which are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company periodically
reviews the investment for other than temporary declines in fair value below cost and more frequently when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. As of September 30, 2022, management has
identified indicators of other-than-temporary impairment that have led to the conclusion that the carrying value of its equity
method investment is not recoverable. As a result, the Company has recorded an impairment write-down in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2022. Refer to Note 6  for disclosures relating to
impairment of the Company’s equity method investment.
Income
(Loss) Per Share
Basic
income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution, using the treasury
stock method, that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or
resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the Company. In computing diluted income (loss) per share, the
treasury stock method assumes that outstanding options and warrants are exercised, and the proceeds are used to purchase common stock
at the average market price during the period. Options and warrants may have a dilutive effect under the treasury stock method only when
the average market price of the common stock during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options and warrants. At September 30,
2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company had
no
options or warrants outstanding and
no
shares issuable for conversion of notes payable.
Stock-based
Compensation
The
value of restricted stock awards is determined using the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company
accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
Recently
Adopted and Pending Accounting Pronouncements
In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06 (“ASU 2020-06”) “Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic
470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments
and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity.” ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the
number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models results
in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current GAAP. Convertible instruments
that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related
to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting
and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. In addition,
ASU 2020-06 amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based
accounting conclusions. The Amendments also affects the diluted EPS calculation for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares
and for convertible instruments. The amendments are effective for public entities excluding smaller reporting companies for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted,
but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods. The Company is still evaluating the effect
the adoption will have on its financial statements.
Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s
present or future consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.

Going Concern
The
Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As reflected in its condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $ 24,929,002
as of September
30, 2022, incurred a net loss of $ 9,256,692 , principally related to the loss on impairment of the Company’s equity-method investee,
and utilized net cash of $ 103,885
in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
The
Company and the Company’s equity-method investment have incurred net losses prior to Q3 2022. These factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that the condensed consolidated financial
statements are issued. The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
The
Company’s primary source of operating funds since inception has been cash proceeds from the private placements of its common stock
and from issuance of its short-term on demand loans, primarily from related parties. The Company intends to raise additional capital
in the short term through addition of demand loans and, once the up listing to a higher exchange is completed, through private placements
to sell restricted shares of common stock to investors. There can be no assurance that these funds will be available on terms acceptable
to the Company, or at all, or will be sufficient to enable the Company to fully complete its development activities or sustain operations.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company raised approximately $ 150,000
in cash proceeds from the sale of its common
stock.
If
the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables,
reduce overhead, scale back its current business plan and/or curtail operations until sufficient additional capital is raised to support
further operations.
The
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to execute its strategy and on its ability to raise
additional funds. Management is currently seeking additional funds, primarily through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities for
cash to operate the Company’s business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available,
that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to it. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue
restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity
and/or convertible debt financing.

Deposit on stock purchase agreement – related party
On
August 7, 2021, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “CGI Agreement”) with Capital Growth Investments,
Inc., a California corporation (“CGI”) and PVI, the Company’s equity-method investee. Pursuant to the Agreement, the
Company can acquire up to
50,000
shares of CGI (the “Shares”), which comprise
50 %
of its issued and outstanding capital stock,
from PVI for an aggregate purchase price of $ 1,000,000 . As of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, $ 195,000
and $ 100,000 , respectively,
was paid by the Company, which was recorded and presented in Deposit-Stock purchase agreement related party, in the Company’s condensed
consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. No shares of CGI will be issued until the full purchase
price is paid.
Within
60 days of execution of the Agreement, the remaining balance of $ 805,000
is to be paid in exchange for the full
50 %
of the Shares of
the Company. Contemporaneously with the execution of the CGI Agreement, the parties entered into a Shareholder Agreement with CGI (the
“Shareholder Agreement”). Pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement, the Company was granted certain anti-dilution rights, as
well certain monthly distributions of net cash from the operations of CGI, along with other voting and indemnification rights. Pursuant
to an Amendment to Stock Purchase Agreement, dated November 26, 2021, the Company, CGI and PVI have acknowledged that the Purchase Price
was to be paid in exchange for the entirety of the Shares on or before March 31, 2022. Should the Company be unable to fund the balance
of $ 805,000
by March 31, 2022, the transaction shall be cancelled and the refundable deposit of $ 195,000
shall be returned to the Company.
In March 2022, all parties agreed to extend the closing to June 30, 2022 (“revised closing date”). Should the Company be
unable to fund the balance of $ 805,000
by September 30, 2022, the transaction will be cancelled, and all deposits would be returned to
the Company.
In
June 2022, both parties agreed to extend the closing date to August 5, 2022. On August 8, 2022, both PVI and CGI mutually agreed to
terminate the Stock Purchase Agreement.
No
shares of CGI had been issued to date, as only $195,000 of the full $ 1,000,000
purchase price had been paid and the terms of the agreement require the transaction to be fully funded before transferring
shares . The balance of the deposit, which had been presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as Deposit on stock
purchase agreement – related party, was reversed in the Q2 2022 period. The balance of Notes payable-related party has been
reduced by $ 100,000
and the balance of Due to related parties has been reduced by $ 95,000 .

Equity Method Investment
In
March 2019, the Company acquired a
50 % investment in Pineapple Ventures, Inc. (“PVI”) in exchange for
2,000,000
shares of
the Company’s Series A Preferred stock, which upon issuance were immediately converted into
20,000,000
shares of common stock.
The investment has been accounted for under the equity method. In addition to having a direct investment, the Company also noted that
common ownership with PVI represents an additional variable interest. However, it was determined that the Company does not have the power
to direct the activities that most significantly impact PVI’s economic performance, and therefore, the Company is not the primary
beneficiary of PVI and PVI has not been consolidated under the variable interest model.
On
January 17, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Jaime Ortega whereby in exchange for Mr. Ortega cancelling $ 1,062,000
of
existing loans extended to the Company by Jaime Ortega, Neu-Ventures, Inc., and Sky Island, Inc., the Company transferred to Mr. Ortega
10,000
shares of capital stock of PVI. Subsequently, on February 11, 2021, the parties entered into amended agreement pursuant to which
the original number of shares sold to Mr. Ortega was reduced from
10,000
shares of capital stock of PVI to
4,827
shares of capital stock
of PVI. Accordingly, the Company currently owns
45,173
shares of capital stock of PVI. This amendment was entered into to correct the
original agreement and properly reflect the value of the Company’s stock at the time of the initial agreement.
The
investment was recorded at cost, which was determined to be $ 11,000,000
based on a value of $ 0.55
per share of common stock. A total
of
10,000,000
shares of common stock were issued during fiscal year 2020. As of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company
has
45.17 % ownership interest in PVI.
In
November 2021, PNPL Holdings Inc., was created for the sole purpose of holding direct equity in the Los Angeles cannabis businesses.
The City of Los Angeles passed a provision stating that management companies cannot directly hold equity in the operations they manage.
As such, PNPL Holdings, Inc. was set up as an affiliate of PVI that is not owned by PVI for PVI’s equity in the operations of dispensaries
in the following California locations: Hollywood and Vine, West Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, Northeast Los Angeles, and San Pedro.
CGI and UHC remain unaffected since these dispensaries are not in the City of Los Angeles.
Previously,
PVI has invested in established cannabis businesses, funded cannabis start-up businesses, managed the aforementioned businesses for a
management fee, and in some instances subleased property to these businesses for a profit. However, as of September 1, 2022, PVI shifted
its primary focus to being a “non-plant touching” entity through development of cannabis assets and resale of the same for
a profit in partnership with its affiliate entities, hemp CBD retail management services for a fee, and leasing and subleasing cannabis
retail properties for a profit. PVI no longer operates or partially owns cannabis assets and acts only as a consultant for the purpose
of facilitating development of those assets through PNPL Holdings, Inc. PNPL Holdings, Inc. is wholly-owned by Matthew Feinstein and,
as such, is a related party to Pineapple, Inc. PVI no longer receives a 10% management fee for these cannabis entities and is now completely
a non-plant touching ancillary service provider to the cannabis industry. As of September 30, 2022, PVI carries no ownership of any cannabis
assets. However, PVI did own the following cannabis assets as of December 31, 2021 (these portions of ownership were transferred to PNPL
Holdings, Inc.):
● Capital
Growth Investments, Inc. (“CGI”):
20 %
as of December 31, 2021 (delivery, cultivation, manufacturing, and distribution)
● Universal
Herbal Center, Inc (“UHC”):
20 %
as of December 31, 2021 (delivery, manufacturing,
distribution, and dispensary).
● PNPLXPRESS,
Inc. (“PXI”):
10 %
equity interest as of December 31, 2021 (delivery and dispensary).
● PNPLXPRESS
II, Inc (“Northeast LA Dispensary”):
49 %
equity interest as of December 31, 2021
(delivery and dispensary).
The
ownership percentages previously owned by PVI were transferred to PNPL Holdings, Inc. During the nine months ended
September
30,
2022, three of the above cannabis assets (CGI, UHC and PXI) generated revenue while PVI held ownership. As noted above, as of
September 30, 2022, PVI no longer has any ownership in these entities.

The
Company has recorded an income from equity investment of $ 1,499,355
during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
Management
reviews its equity investment for impairment if and when circumstances indicate that a decline in fair value below its carrying amount
may have occurred. PNPL determined that a triggering event occurred in September 2022 with respect to its equity method investment in
PVI, due to the change in business strategy as of September 1, 2022 and the general adverse developments in the
California cannabis industry, both of which have negatively impacted the investment’s strategic direction.  After completing
its impairment assessment, management determined that the carrying amount exceeded its estimated fair value and the impairment condition
was considered other than temporary. The assumptions that most significantly affected the fair value determination included projected
cash flows and the discount rate. The Company-specific inputs for measuring fair value are considered “Level 3” or unobservable
inputs that are not corroborated by market data under applicable fair value authoritative guidance, as quoted market prices are not available.
As
such, PNPL has recorded an impairment charge of $ 10,787,652
during Q3 2022. These non-cash impairment charges are included in other income and
expenses in  the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three- and nine- months ended September 30,
2022.

Eric
Kennedy (former director)
In
May 2019, the Company agreed to a settlement with Eric Kennedy, a Company’s director, related to deferred cash compensation
that had been accrued for in the Company’s accounts payable and accrued liabilities to reduce the amount to $ 35,000 ,
resulting in a gain on settlement of related party payables of $ 36,000 ,
which was recorded in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ (deficit) equity. Therefore, the $ 35,000
was reclassified to related party notes payable.
The
note does not incur interest and was originally to be repaid through an initial $ 10,000
payment with monthly payments of $ 5,000
thereafter,
but the Company was only able to make one $ 5,000
payment, reducing the balance to $ 30,000
as of December 31, 2020. The Company did not
make any payment during the year ended December 31, 2021.
During
the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, Eric Kennedy forgave the amount due from the Company, as he was not awaiting repayment
for any funding he had provided to the Company during previous years. This settlement has been recorded as a gain on forgiveness of related
party note payable in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The balance of the former related party notes payable is
zero
as of
June 30, 2022. There has been no activity during the three months ended September 30, 2022.

Neu-Ventures,
Inc. (The owner is the largest shareholder of the Company)
Beginning
in April 2019, the Company also began receiving advances from Neu-Ventures, Inc., another entity owned by our majority shareholder, Mr.
Ortega. These advances are due on demand and do not incur interest.
Advances
from Neu-Ventures in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, totaled $ 1,700
and $ 5,885 , respectively, offset by cash repayments
of $ 0
and $ 52,000 , respectively. Neu-Ventures also paid $ 27,387
and $ 62,935 , respectively, of corporate expenses on behalf of the Company
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.
During
fiscal year 2021, Neu-Ventures also paid $ 100,000
on behalf of the Company pursuant to the stock purchase agreement entered into on August
7, 2021, to acquire up to
50,000
shares of Capital Growth Investments, Inc. Such payment is reported under Deposit on stock purchase
agreement-related party in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021. The transaction was cancelled
subsequently to the Q2 period-end, as described in Note 4. The balance of the deposit on stock purchase agreement at June 30, 2022 was
zero
and the payable to Neu-Ventures has been reduced accordingly. There has been no activity during the three month period ended September
30, 2022.
The

Note Payable
The
Company, through our former subsidiary, BBC, entered into a $ 25,000

July 2, 2016, for purposes of funding periodic capital needs. The original agreement provided for a term of six months but has been extended
month-to-month thereafter by mutual verbal consent of the parties. The total balance of that credit line as of September 30, 2022, and
December 31, 2021, is $ 27,313 , which includes principal of $ 19,838
and $ 7,475
of accrued interest from prior years. The balance has been
guaranteed by Matt Feinstein, a director of the Company. The Company is currently in talks with a collection company to settle this debt
and has stopped accruing interest. There has been no activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.

In
December 2015, the Company entered into a Revenue Share Agreement for $ 750,000
that was recorded as “advances on agreements”
liability. As per the Revenue Share Agreement, in the event that, for the period from February 5, 2016, through the three-year anniversary
of the Effective Date, if Lessee fails to pay the Company any Fixed Minimum Rent, the Company shall be required to pay to Investor Three,
in full, Investor Three’s share each month until the Company has paid Investor Three an aggregate of $ 825,000
under this Revenue
Share Agreement. Thereafter, the Company shall have no further obligations or responsibilities to Investor Three in connection with this
Revenue Share Agreement. Due to the above clause, by reason of defaults on the DHS Project (as defined elsewhere herein), an additional
penalty of $ 75,000
was incurred which was recorded as deferred finance cost. During the fiscal year 2018, the Company reduced $ 200,000
of principal by transferring land to Investor Three. During the fiscal year 2018, the Company also recorded a loss on settlement of debt
in the consolidated statements of operations increasing the balance by $ 97,800
to $ 615,000

On
February 16, 2016, the Company entered into a Binding Letter of Intent (“BLOI1”) with Investor One that the Company deemed
a financing agreement for the purchase of a certain property (APN: 665-030-044), and upon completion of development of the acquired property,
subsequently a revenue share agreement that was for the following considerations: (i) payment by Investor One of $ 125,000 , representing
one-half the purchase price of the property, (ii) the Company would have repurchased the financed property for $ 187,500
within one year
of the purchase, and (iii) “rent” payments of $ 3,750 /month would have occurred during the referenced one year period.
During
March 2016, the $ 125,000
in financing from Investor One, in addition to $ 40,768
from the Company, was deposited in Escrow No.: 7101604737-ST
with Chicago Title Company against the purchase of another property (APN: 665-030-043) that was the subject of additional funding by
Investor Two, described below.
Investor
Two
On
March 18, 2016, the Company entered into a Binding Letter of Intent (“BLOI2”), subsequently amended by a Real Property Purchase
and Sale Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions (“Subsequent Land Purchase Agreement”) dated March 21, 2016, both of which
the Company deemed a financing agreement for the purchase of a certain property (APN: 665-030-043) for the following considerations:
(i) payment by Investor Two of $ 350,000
of the $ 515,000
purchase price of the property, (ii) the Company would assign the existing escrow
amount of $ 165,768
to Investor Two, who would close the transaction and take title to the property, (iii) the Company would pay any taxes,
fees and other out-of-pocket expenses associated with the transaction, and (iv) the Company would have repurchased the property from
Investor Two for a price of $ 500,000
within ninety days of the closing of the transaction.
On
March 22, 2016, Investor Two deposited $ 350,000
into the escrow account referenced above and the transaction closed with title conveyed
to Investor Two as required under BLOI2. Subsequent to closing, the Company defaulted under the BLOI2 and the Subsequent Land Purchase
Agreement as it did not reacquire the property in the required ninety days after closing. As a consequence, the Company forfeited the
$ 165,768
deposited into the Chicago Title Escrow account referenced above.

Investment
Accounting Treatments for Investors One and Two
The
escrow agreement closed and Investor Two took title to property. There is no provision in BLOI2, or in the Subsequent Land Purchase Agreement,
that would impose any continuing liability on the Company other than the loss of the Company’s escrow deposit.
As
no terms and conditions were established to characterize the $ 125,000
investment as a Note Payable, the Company has recorded a continuing
liability to Investor One in connection with BLOI1 having been recorded as a deferred liability. Contrary to the case with Investor Two,
the Company acknowledged the additional $ 62,500
liability provided for under BLOI1 and $ 187,500
was recorded as “advances on agreements”
as a short-term deferred liability on the Company’s books and records. Additionally, BLOI1 provided for a “rent” payment
of $ 3,750
for a period of twelve months after execution of BLOI1.
In
February 2019, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Investor One which required the issuance of
20,000
shares of the
Company’s common stock and established an additional principal sum for repayment of $ 200,000 . The settlement includes installment
payments of $ 10,000
per month beginning on February 15, 2019, until the balance is repaid and ends the accrual of interest. Prior to
entering into the settlement agreement, the Company had recorded interest expense of $ 4,125 , bringing the balance from $ 187,500
at December
31, 2018 to $ 191,625 . The settlement agreement resulted in additional expense of $ 8,375 . The Company made three $ 10,000
payments during
the year ended December 31, 2019, reduced the value by another $ 1,000
in connection with the
20,000
shares being valued at $ 11,000
instead
of the $ 10,000
value initially discussed. There was
no
activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.

Introduction
The
Company has spent the last several years recasting the direction of the Company. We intend to take advantage of the opportunities that
have been identified in the cannabis sectors. The market opportunities that are opened to a cannabis company include PVI’s involvement
with cannabis delivery, retail, manufacturing, and cultivation. Our main focus has been to receive 45.17% of all net income (loss) generated
by PVI from its business ventures, as well as selling the Top Shelf System to cannabis dispensaries.
Our
Business
The
Company was originally formed in the state of Nevada under the name Global Resources, Ltd. on August 3, 1983. It changed its name to
“Helixphere Technologies Inc.” on April 12, 1999, and to “New China Global Inc.” on October 2, 2013. It reincorporated
in Wyoming on October 30, 2013, changed its name to “Globestar Industries” on July 15, 2014. On August 24, 2015, the Company
entered into a share exchange agreement with Better Business Consultants, Inc. (“BBC” dba “MJ Business Consultants”),
a corporation formed in California on January 29, 2015, all of BBC’s shareholders, and the Company’s majority shareholder
at that time (the “BBC Share Exchange”). Pursuant to the BBC Share Exchange, BBC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company. Upon consummation of the BBC Share Exchange, the Company ceased its prior business of providing educational services and continued
the business of BBC as its sole line of business. BBC has three wholly owned subsidiaries, Pineapple Express One LLC, a California limited
liability company, Pineapple Express Two LLC, a California limited liability company, and Pineapple Properties Investments, LLC, a Washington
limited liability company. Better Business Consultants, Inc. has since been sold by the Company. On September 3, 2015, the Company changed
its name to “Pineapple Express, Inc.” from “Globestar Industries.” Currently, the Company is in the process of seeking regulatory approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(“FINRA”) to change its name to Pineapple, Inc.
The Company was also assigned a patent for the
proprietary Top Shelf Safe Display System (“SDS”) for use in permitted cannabis dispensaries and delivery vehicles across
the United States and internationally (where permitted by law), on July 20th, 2016, by Sky Island, Inc. (the “SDS Patent”)
via a Patent Assignment Agreement (the “Patent Assignment Agreement”). The SDS Patent was originally applied for and filed
on August 11, 2015, by Sky Island, Inc. and received its notice of allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office on March
22, 2017. It is anticipated that the Top-Shelf SDS product shall retail for $30,000 per unit. Pineapple intends to sell the Top-Shelf
SDS units to PVI for use in retail storefronts and delivery vehicles as well as to sell the Top Shelf SDS technology to other cannabis
retail companies. The Company anticipates beginning sales of the Top Shelf SDS system in the third quarter of 2023.
21
On March 19, 2019, the Company entered into a Share
Exchange Agreement (the “PVI Agreement”) with Pineapple Ventures, Inc. (“PVI”), the Company’s equity-method
investment, and the stockholders of PVI (the “PVI Stockholders”) in which the Company acquired a total of 50% of the outstanding
shares of PVI, in consideration for 2,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
may, from time to time, be converted by the holder into shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.0000001 (the “Common
Stock”), in an amount equal to ten (10) shares of Common Stock for each one share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The PVI
Stockholders elected to immediately convert the 2,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into 20,000,000 shares of common
stock upon issuance
On January 17, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Jaime Ortega
whereby in exchange for Mr. Ortega cancelling $1,062,000 of existing loans extended to the Company by Jaime Ortega, Neu-Ventures, Inc.,
and Sky Island, Inc., the Company transferred to Mr. Ortega 10,000 shares of capital stock of PVI. Subsequently, on February 11, 2021,
the parties entered into amended agreement pursuant to which the original number of shares sold to Mr. Ortega was reduced from 10,000
shares of capital stock of PVI to 4,827 shares of capital stock of PVI. Accordingly, the Company currently owns 45,173 shares of capital
stock of PVI. This amendment was entered into to correct the original agreement and properly reflect the value of the Company’s
stock at the time of the initial agreement. As of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company has a 45.17% ownership interest
in PVI, its equity-method investment. As of September 30, 2022, this investment has been fully impaired.
Pursuant
to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger Agreement”), dated as of April 6, 2020, by and between, Pineapple Express, Inc.,
a Wyoming corporation (“Pineapple Express”), and Pineapple, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Pineapple”) and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Pineapple Express, effective as of April 15, 2020 (the “Effective Date”), Pineapple Express merged with and
into Pineapple, with Pineapple being the surviving entity (the “Reincorporation Merger”). The Reincorporation Merger was
consummated to complete Pineapple Express’ reincorporation from the State of Wyoming to the State of Nevada. The Merger Agreement,
the Reincorporation Merger, the Name Change (as defined below) and the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Pineapple were duly approved
by the written consent of shareholders of Pineapple Express owning at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Pineapple Express’
common stock. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company’s corporate name changed from “Pineapple Express, Inc.”
to “Pineapple, Inc.”
The
Company is based in Los Angeles, California. Through the Company’s operating subsidiary Pineapple Express Consulting, Inc.
(“PEC”), as well as its PVI portfolio asset, the Company has historically provided capital to its canna-business
clientele, leases properties to those canna-businesses, takes equity positions and manages those operations, and provides consulting
and technology to develop, enhance, or expand existing and newly formed infrastructures. As of September 1, 2022, PVI shifted its
primary focus to being a “non-plant touching” entity through development of cannabis assets and resale of the same for a
profit in partnership with its affiliate entities, hemp CBD retail management services for a fee, and leasing and subleasing
cannabis retail properties for a profit. PVI no longer operates or partially owns cannabis assets and acts only as a consultant for
the purpose of facilitating development and future equity sales of those assets through PNPL holdings, the sales of which PVI will
continue to earn. The cannabis assets are developed under PNPL Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of PVI that is not owned by PVI. PVI no
longer receives a 10% management fee for these cannabis entities and is now completely a non-plant touching ancillary service
provider to the cannabis industry. Pineapple aims to become the leading portfolio management company in the U.S. cannabis sector.
The Company’s executive team blends enterprise-level corporate expertise with a combined three decades of experience operating
in the tightly regulated cannabis industry. While PVI is generating revenues
from the above-mentioned means, PEC is currently still in development and is currently not generating revenues.
Impact
of COVID-19
In
March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, which continues to spread
throughout the United States. As a result, significant volatility has occurred in both the United States and International markets. While
the disruption is currently expected to be temporary, there is uncertainty around the duration. To date, the Company has experienced
declining revenues, difficulty staffing interpreters, difficulty meeting debt covenants, maintaining consistent service quality with
reduced revenue, and a loss of customers. Management expects this matter to continue to impact our business, results of operations, and
financial position, but the ultimate financial impact of the pandemic on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial
position, liquidity, or capital resources cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

the nine months ended September 30, 2021. This is due to the foregoing decrease in general and administrative expenses.
Other
income (expense)
During
the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company has total other expense of $8,872,010, consisting of $1,499,355 of income from
the Company’s equity method investment, $30,000 recognized for gain on forgiveness of a related party note payable due to Eric
Kennedy, $386,287 from gain on the sale of Pineapple Park, and $10,787,652 from loss on impairment of the equity-method investment. The
$1,499,355 of income from the Company’s equity-method investee is primarily comprised of the following: gain of $4,965,510 from
the sale of equity interest from previously acquired dispensaries, in excess of the carrying cost of the original acquisition, $487,993
of management fees and rental income, offset by $2,113,324 of general and administrative expenses and $20,130 of depreciation expense.
During
the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company has total other expense of $790,126 consisting of losses from the Company’s
equity method investment. The net loss is primarily comprised of $50,388 of management fees and rental income, offset by $832,896 of
general and administrative expenses and $8,475 of depreciation expense.
Net
income (loss)
As
a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded a net loss of $9,256,692 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to
a net loss of $1,242,779 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
As
of September 30, 2022, we had a working capital deficit of $2,779,311 and no cash. As of September 30, 2022, the Company’s current
liabilities included $367,124 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, $47,500 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related
party, $6,771 in accrued interest payable, $763,739 in related party notes payable, $19,838 in other notes payable, $615,000 in settlement
payable related party, $169,000 in advances on agreement, $105,523 in contingent liabilities and $684,816 due to affiliates. We have
funded our operations since inception primarily through the issuance of our equity securities in private placements to third parties,
and/or promissory notes to related parties for cash. The cash was used primarily for operating activities, including cost of employees,
management services, professional fees, consultant fees, and travel. Our management expects that cash from operating activities will
not provide sufficient cash to fund normal operations, support debt service, or undertake certain investments we anticipate prosecuting
for our business proposition both in the near and intermediate terms. We will continue to rely on financing provided under notes from
related and third-party party sources, as well as sale of shares of our common stock in private placements, to fund our expected cash
requirements.
We
intend to continue raising additional capital through related party loans and future sale of equity interest. There can be no assurance
that these funds will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all, or will be sufficient to enable us to fully complete our development
activities or sustain operations. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional funds, we will have to develop and implement a plan
to further extend payables, reduce overhead and operations, or scale back our current business plan until sufficient additional capital
is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.
25
Our
condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report have been prepared assuming that we will continue
as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal
course of business. As reflected in such condensed consolidated financial statements, we had an accumulated stockholders’ deficit
of $24,929,002 and had a net loss of $9,256,692 and utilized net cash of $103,885 in operating activities as of and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2022. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our independent
registered public accounting firms in their audit reports to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December
31, 2021, and 2020, expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going
concern was raised due to our net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and our expectation that these conditions
may continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we will require additional financing to fund future operations. Our condensed consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as
a going concern.
Based
on our management’s estimates and expectation to continue to receive short-term debt funding from a related party on as needed
basis, we believe that current funds on hand as of the date of issuance and proceeds of such loans will be sufficient for us to continue
operations beyond twelve months from the filing of this Form 10-Q. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability
to execute our business strategy and in our ability to raise additional funds. Management is currently seeking additional funds, primarily
through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities for cash to operate our business; however, we can give no assurance that any future
financing will be available or, if at all, and if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we can obtain
additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution
for our stockholders, in the case of equity and/or convertible debt financing.
Sources
and Uses of Cash
Operating
Activities
During
the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we used $103,885 of cash in operating activities, primarily as a result of our net
loss of $9,256,692, net of depreciation expense of $4,129, and income from the Company’s equity-method investment of
$1,499,355. Net change in operating assets and liabilities increased by $276,668, primarily due to an increase in balances due to
related parties of $154,868 and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities (including related party) of
$121,800.
During
the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we used $61,375 of cash in operating activities, primarily as a result of our net loss of $1,242,779,
net of non-cash operating expenses of $829,749, including depreciation expense of $4,623, stock-based compensation of $35,000, and a
loss from the Company’s equity method investment of $790,126. Operating liabilities increased by $351,655, primarily due to an
increase in balances due to related parties of $271,571 and increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities (including related party)
of $80,084.
Investing
Activities
There were no cash flows from investing activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.
Financing
Activities
During
the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we received $150,000 in cash from private placement to third parties for shares to be issued.
Advances from related parties totaled $5,885 and repayment amounted to $52,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
During
the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we received $249,000 in cash from private placement to third parties. Advances from related parties
totaled $56,325 and repayment amounted to $243,950 in the nine months ended September 30, 2021.
26
Going
Concern Qualification
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the entity will continue as a going
concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses
from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, that have or are reasonably likely to
have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information by this Item.
Item
4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) that are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of “disclosure controls and
procedures” in Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Management based its controls on the report, “2013 Internal Control-Integrated
Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
At
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we conducted an evaluation (the “Evaluation”), under the supervision
and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon the foregoing, and to the same extent as reported in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30,
2022, the disclosure controls and procedures of our Company were not effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed
in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis because of the material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting described below.
Material
Weaknesses and Corrective Actions
To
the same extent as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, we identified certain deficiencies
relating to our internal control over financial reporting that constitute a material weakness under standards established by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”). The PCAOB defines a material weakness as a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A deficiency in internal
control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their
assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.
27
The
following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting continued to exist as of September 30, 2022:
●
The
Company does not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal
controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”);
●
Due
to the size of the Company and available resources, there are limited personnel to assist with the accounting and financial reporting
functions, which results in lack of sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control.
Due to the Company’s limited size and early-stage nature of operations, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always
be possible and may not be economically feasible; however, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of
assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals;
●
The
Company does not have an audit committee of our board of directors; and
●
Insufficient
monitoring and review controls over the financial reporting closing process, including the lack of individuals with current knowledge
of U.S. GAAP.
To
remediate the Company’s internal control weaknesses, management intends to implement the following measures, as finances allow:
●
Adding
sufficient accounting personnel or outside consultants to properly segregate duties and to affect a timely, accurate preparation
of the financial statements.
●
Developing
and maintaining adequate written accounting policies and procedures once additional accounting personnel or outside consultants are
engaged.
The
additional hiring is contingent upon our efforts to obtain additional funding and the results of our operations.
Management
expects to secure funds before the end of the current fiscal year but provides no assurances that it will be able to do so.
Notwithstanding
the material weaknesses discussed above, our management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, concluded that the condensed consolidated
financial statements in this quarterly report fairly present, in all material respects, the Company’s financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows for the periods presented, in conformity with GAAP.
Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2022, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
CEO
and CFO Certifications
Exhibit
31.1 to this Quarterly Report has the “Certifications” of our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. These
Certifications are required in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the “Section 302 Certifications”).
This Item 4 of this Quarterly Report contains is the information concerning the Evaluation referred to in the Section 302 Certifications,
and this information should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics

PART
II — OTHER INFORMATION
Item
1. Legal Proceedings.
In
the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various claims and litigation. While the outcome of any litigation is inherently
unpredictable, the Company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it and that the ultimate
resolution of these matters will not have a materially adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
The following is a list of current litigation:
Pineapple
Express v. Ramsey Salem
JAMS
Arbitration Reference Number: 1220063897 was filed December 4, 2019. This matter arises from claims of breach of contract, more specifically
the confidentiality provisions of certain Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated February 12, 2016, entered into between
the parties and arising from the disclosure of the interim arbitration award in the matter entitled and above-referenced as: Salem, et
al. v. Pineapple Express, Inc., et al. JAMS Arbitration Reference Number: 1210035565, filed July 13, 2018, by Respondent. On April 8,

v. Pineapple Express, Inc., et al.
Los

nor are Defendants contracting parties to the lease agreement or original revenue sharing agreement for which consideration was paid.
Defendants deny all allegations of claims asserted in the Complaint. Notwithstanding, the parties settled the matter pursuant to a confidential
settlement agreement in or about January 3, 2020. However, the matter was reduced to an entry of judgment by the court in or about February
21, 2020, for the amount of $615,000, which monies remain due and outstanding and are accrued for in the Company’s settlement payable
as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The parties are cooperating to resolve this matter pursuant to the terms of the agreed
upon settlement.

matter was stayed on February 11, 2019, pending the outcome of Arbitration. Finnegan & Diba was substituted out of the matter on

Pineapple Express, Inc. without specificity as to the judgment debtor’s state of incorporation, and Pineapple Express Consulting
Inc., which remains due and outstanding. The accrual in the Company’s contingent liabilities as of September 30, 2022, and December

for in the Company’s contingent liabilities as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021.

& Diba was not the counsel of record when judgment was entered and only addressed enforcement proceedings until such time it was

29
StoryCorp
Consulting, dba Wells Compliance Group v. Pineapple Express, Inc.
JAMS
Arbitration Reference Number: 1210037058 ,
filed December 18, 2019. This matter arises from dispute over certain services agreement
entered into between the parties in or about January 31, 2019. In 2020, the parties agreed on a settlement amount of $15,000. The parties
self-represented in arbitration and a final arbitration award was issued in the amount $23,805 on or about October 27, 2020, against
the Company. Claimant has since filed a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award against Pineapple Express, Inc. a California Corporation,
with the Los Angeles Superior Court bearing Case Number 20STCP04003, set for hearing on April 12, 2021. On information and belief, Pineapple
Express Inc., a California Corporation, is not affiliated with Pineapple Inc., a Nevada Corporation, formerly known as Pineapple Express,
Inc., a Wyoming Corporation. Claimant amended its complaint on or about February 3, 2021, to include Defendant Pineapple Express, Inc.,
a Wyoming corporation. A default judgement was entered on May 11, 2021, against Pineapple Express, Inc., in the amount of $29,280. Defendant,

and resolve this matter. The $29,280 has been accrued for as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, in the Company’s contingent
liabilities.

awarded to Russ Schamun. This creditor will be satisfied once the Company is in a position to satisfy the judgment. The $7,500 has been
accrued for as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, in the Company’s contingent liabilities.
SRFF
v. Pineapple Express, Inc.
This
matter resulted in a stipulated judgment whereas former SEC counsel claimed approximately $60,000 in legal work that was not paid for.
The Company claimed that the work being charged for (a registration statement to be filed with the SEC) was not completed. Regardless
of this fact, the Company signed a payment plan and confession of judgment if the plan was not honored. The result was a judgment entered
in favor of SRFF because of the confession. This creditor will be satisfied once the Company is in a position to satisfy the judgment.
The settlement amount has been accrued for in the Company’s accounts payable and accrued liabilities balance at September 30, 2022,
and December 31, 2021.
