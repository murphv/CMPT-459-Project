NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNAUDITED   NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS   Company Overview   Xeriant, Inc. (“Xeriant” or the “Company”) is dedicated to the acquisition, development and commercialization of transformative technologies, including eco-friendly specialty materials which can be successfully deployed and integrated across multiple industry sectors, and disruptive innovations related to the emerging aviation market called Advanced Air Mobility, which include next-generation aircraft. We seek to partner with and acquire strategic interests in visionary companies that accelerate this mission.
The Company was incorporated in Nevada on December 18, 2009.   On April 16, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with American Aviation Technologies, LLC (“AAT”), an aircraft design and development company focused on the emerging segment of the aviation industry of autonomous and semi-autonomous vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).   On September 30, 2019, the acquisition of AAT closed, and AAT became a subsidiary of the Company.   On June 22, 2020, the name of the Company was changed to Xeriant, Inc. in the State of Nevada and subsequently approved by FINRA effective July 30, 2020 for the name and symbol change (XERI).   On May 31, 2021, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with XTI Aircraft Company, to form a new company, called Eco-Aero, LLC, for purpose of completing the preliminary design of XTI’s TriFan 600, a 5-passenger plus pilot, hybrid electric, vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) fixed wing aircraft.
Effective April 2, 2022 and Amended November 7, 2022, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Movychem s.r.o., a Slovakian limited liability company (“Movychem”) setting forth the terms for the establishment of a joint venture (the “Joint Venture”) to develop applications and commercialize a series of flame retardant products in the form of polymer gels, powders, liquids and pellets derived from technology developed by Movychem under the name Retacell™. The Joint Venture is organized as a Florida limited liability company under the name Ebenberg, LLC and is owned 50% by each of the Company and Movychem.   Advanced Materials   A primary focus of our Company is the acquisition and commercial exploitation of eco-friendly, advanced materials and chemicals which have applications across a broad range of industries and the potential to generate significant near-term revenue. The Company’s commercialization strategy encompasses licensing arrangements and joint ventures with major industry players, which would allow for more rapid access to the market with reduced capital requirements and financial risk. In addition to providing the production and distribution infrastructure, these established partnering companies can streamline testing and certification and add brand recognition value. The advanced materials and chemicals may be sold as standalone products, enhancements to existing products, or used in the development of proprietary products under a new trademarked brand owned by the Company. The Company is exploring manufacturing and branding opportunities for specific products derived from advanced materials and chemicals acquired or developed, which would involve setting up production facilities, equipment, systems and supply chain. Our plan to source and acquire strategic interests in visionary companies developing, integrating, and commercializing critical breakthrough technologies is underway with our first advanced materials transaction closed in the second quarter of 2022.
F-6 Table of Contents   Effective April 2, 2022, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Movychem s.r.o, a Slovakian chemical
company, setting forth the terms for a joint venture (referred to herein as the Movychem JV) to develop applications and commercialize a series of products
which incorporate an internationally patented flame-retardant technology developed by Movychem under the trade name Retacell ® . The Movychem JV, owned 50% by Xeriant and 50% by Movychem, subject to certain funding conditions, has been granted the exclusive worldwide rights to the intellectual property related to Retacell ®
and will be responsible for developing applications and commercializing products derived from Retacell ® . Engineered over two decades, Retacell ®
is a versatile, biodegradable, non-toxic, high-performance thermal and fire protection chemical agent that is custom formulated for each application, based on the specific properties of the base material and the fire protection requirements. Retacell ®
can be applied as a coating, treatment, or infused during manufacturing into a variety of materials, including recycled plastics and wood-based fiber.  In addition to becoming heat and fire resistant, the resulting Retacell ® -enhanced materials are also water resistant.   On June 8, 2022, we announced the successful development of a multi-purpose, high-strength fire- and water-resistant composite panel made from a formulation of Retacell ®
and a cardboard fiber-reinforced polymeric resin, which can be sourced from recycled materials. The panel is fabricated through a compression molding process and may be produced or cut in varying thicknesses and sizes, including standard 48” x 96” sheets. Depending on the application, the panel can have different colors, textures or decorative finishes. Potential interior and exterior construction applications include walls, ceilings, flooring, framing, siding, roofing, and decking.
Xeriant, pursuant to the Services Agreement with the Movychem JV, is planning to buildout manufacturing facilities in the United States and Eastern Europe to meet the demand for Retacell ®
and Retacell ® -infused products. The manufacturing facilities will be owned and operated by Xeriant and will wholesale product to customers licensed by the Movychem JV. We have identified potential sites, received bids for specialized manufacturing equipment, developed timetables related to the action plan, and hired a managing director with decades of experience to oversee the projects.
Aerospace   Another area of interest for our Company is the emerging aviation market called Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), the transition to more efficient, eco-friendly, automated and convenient flight operations enabled by the convergence of technological advancements in design and engineering, composite materials, propulsion systems, battery energy density and manufacturing processes. Next-generation aircraft being developed for this market offer low-cost, on-demand flight for passengers and cargo, utilizing lower altitude airspace and bypassing the traditional hub and spoke airport network with vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities. Many of these lightweight aircraft are electrically powered through either hybrid or pure battery systems, which allows for quieter, low emission flights over urban areas, however with limited speed and range. The adoption and integration of niche aerial services through AAM is expected to provide benefits throughout the economy. We plan to partner with and acquire strategic interests in visionary companies that accelerate our mission of commercializing critical breakthrough AAM technologies which enhance performance, increase safety, and enable and support more efficient, autonomous, and sustainable flight operations, including electric and hybrid-electric passenger and cargo transport aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing. Our plan to source and acquire strategic interests in leading aerospace companies developing breakthrough VTOL aircraft began in the second quarter of 2021.
Effective May 27, 2021, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with XTI Aircraft Company (“XTI”), a privately owned OEM based in Englewood, Colorado for the purpose of completing the preliminary design of XTI’s TriFan 600, a 5-passenger plus pilot, hybrid electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) fixed-wing aircraft.
Through our joint venture with XTI, (referred to hereinafter as the “XTI JV”), we were involved in the successful completion of the preliminary design of their TriFan 600 eVTOL aircraft. The TriFan 600 is being designed to become the fastest, longest-range VTOL aircraft in the world and the first commercial fixed-wing VTOL airplane, with current pre-orders and reservations of almost $7 billion in gross revenue upon delivery of those aircraft.
F-7 Table of Contents   While the purpose of the XTI JV has been achieved, XTI and Xeriant continue to see value in the XTI JV for future collaboration in Advanced Air Mobility. Should XTI and Xeriant determine it is in their best interest to terminate the XTI JV, then it will be dissolved. Should the XTI JV be dissolved, as of October 18, 2022, Xeriant would receive 5.5% equity ownership of XTI.   Management believes that our holding and operating company structure has several advantages and will enable us to grow rapidly, acquiring assets primarily through acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic investments, and licensing arrangements. As a publicly traded company, we offer our subsidiaries such benefits as improved access to capital, higher valuations and lower risk through the shared ownership of a diversified portfolio, while allowing these entities to maintain independence in their distinct operations to focus on their fields of expertise. Cost savings and efficiencies may be realized from sharing non-operational functions such as finance, legal, tax, sales & marketing, human resources, purchasing power, as well as investor and public relations.
Additionally, we are leveraging our relationship with Florida Atlantic University to provide a collaborative research arm for technologies that require additional validation and the backing of a respected research institution for credibility. The university also may provide access to various grants through the SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research), STTR (Small Business Technology Transfer, NSF (National Science Foundation) and other programs, and if warranted, introductions into a number of government agencies, such as DOD (Department of Defense) and DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). We are pursuing strategic alliances with companies that provide complementary technologies and access to new markets.   NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation   The consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of the Company, American Aviation Technologies, LLC, and Eco-Aero, LLC, its subsidiaries, are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Financial Statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and presented in US dollars. The fiscal year end is June 30.   Going Concern   The Company's financial statements are prepared using the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had $ 119,593
and $ 1,065,945
in cash and $ 5,947,221
and $ 3,002,259
in negative working capital, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had a net loss of $ 6,111,883
and $ 9,974,398 , respectively. Continued losses may adversely affect the liquidity of the Company in the future. Therefore, the factors noted above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying balance sheets is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company's ability to raise additional capital, obtain financing and to succeed in its future operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company’s existence is dependent upon management’s ability to develop profitable operations and resolve its liquidity problems.     F-8 Table of Contents   NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Principles of Consolidation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Xeriant, Inc., American Aviation Technologies, LLC, and Eco-Aero, LLC. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the valuation of beneficial conversion features and warrants associated with convertible debt. Actual results could differ from these estimates.    Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments   The Company adopted ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. ASC Topic 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:   Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.   Level 2: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.   Level 3: Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.   The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including all current liabilities are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.   The inputs to the valuation methodology of stock options and warrants were under level 3 fair value measurements.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company has no cash equivalents.   Convertible Debentures   If the conversion features of conventional convertible debt provide for a rate of conversion that is below market value at issuance, this feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature ("BCF"). A BCF is recorded by the Company as a debt discount pursuant to ASC Topic 470-20 "Debt with Conversion and Other Options." In those circumstances, the convertible debt is recorded net of the discount related to the BCF, and the Company amortizes the discount to interest expense, over the life of the debt. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded a BCF in the amount of $ 2,615,419 .     F-9 Table of Contents   NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   Stock-based Compensation   The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity incentive awards based on the grant date fair value of the award. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock options granted to employees or consultants. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, which is usually the vesting period.
Research and Development Expenses   Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred research and development expenses of $ 0
and $ 5,200,219
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.   Advertising and Marketing Expenses   The Company expenses advertising and marketing costs as they are incurred. The Company recorded advertising expenses in the amount of $ 21,421
and $ 164,713
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.   Income Taxes   The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is more likely than not of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of general and administrative expenses. Our consolidated federal tax return and any state tax returns are not currently under examination.   The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes ("ASC 740-10") for recording the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability during each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change. Deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods.   Basic Income (Loss) Per Share   Under the provisions of ASC 260, “Earnings per Share,” basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would then share in the income of the Company, subject to anti-dilution limitations.
F-10 Table of Contents   The table below presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:        For the six months ended December 31, 2022     For the six months ended December 30, 2021   Numerator:             Net loss   $ ( 6,097,151

)   NOTE 3 – JOINT VENTURE   JV with XTI Aircraft   On May 31, 2021, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the “Agreement”) with XTI Aircraft Company (“XTI”), a Delaware corporation, to form a new company, called Eco-Aero, LLC (the “JV”), a Delaware limited liability company, with the purpose of completing the preliminary design of XTI’s TriFan 600, a 5-passenger plus pilot, hybrid electric, vertical takeoff, and landing (eVTOL) fixed wing aircraft. Under the Agreement, Xeriant is contributing capital, technology, and strategic business relationships, and XTI is contributing intellectual property licensing rights and know-how. XTI and the Company each own
50
percent of the JV. The JV is managed by a management committee consisting of five members, three appointed by the Company and two by XTI. The Agreement was effective on June 4, 2021, with an initial deposit of $ 1
million into the JV. Xeriant’s financial commitment is for up to $ 10
million, contributed as required by the aircraft development timeline and budget. Preliminary design review was substantially completed for the TriFan 600 aircraft in early 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had contributed $ 5,479,547
towards the XTI JV.   The Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810
Consolidation , to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The Joint Venture qualifies as a VIE based on the fact the JV does not have sufficient equity to operate without financial support from Xeriant. According to ASC 810-25-38, a reporting entity shall consolidate a VIE when that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the reporting entity with a controlling financial interest on the basis of the provisions in paragraphs 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J. The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that VIE. According to the JV operating agreement, the ownership interests are 50/50. However, the agreement provides for a Management Committee of five members. Three of the five members are from Xeriant. Additionally, Xeriant has an obligation to invest $ 10,000,000
into the JV. As such, Xeriant has substantial capital at risk. Based on these two factors, the conclusion is that Xeriant is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, Xeriant has consolidated the VIE.     F-11 Table of Contents   JV with Movychem   On April 2, 2022 the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Movychem s.r.o., a Slovakian limited liability company setting forth the terms for the establishment of a joint venture (the “Joint Venture”) to develop applications and commercialize a series of flame-retardant products in the form of polymer gels, powders, liquids and pellets derived from technology developed by Movychem under the name Retacell ™ . The Joint Venture is organized as a Florida limited liability company under the name Ebenberg, LLC and is owned
50 % by each of the Company and Movychem.   For its capital contribution to the Joint Venture, pursuant to a Patent and Exclusive License and Assignment Agreement (the “Patent Agreement”),
Movychem is transferring to the Joint Venture all of its interest to the know-how and intellectual property relating to Retacell exclusive of all patents, and the Company is contributing the amount of $2,600,000 payable (a) $600,000 at the rate of $25,000 per month over a 24 month period and (b) $2,000,000 within five business days of a closing of a financing in which the Company receives net proceeds of at least $3,000,000 but in no event later than six months from the Effective Date
(Amended to February 15, 2023, as per Amended Agreement). As of December 31, 2022, the Company had two payments pending of $ 25,000
each, subject to satisfaction by Movychem of the terms of the Amendment to Joint Venture Agreement with Movychem. The Company is currently in discussions with Movychem with the intent of extending the February 15, 2023 date. At such time as the Company makes its $ 2,000,000
payment (and assuming the Company is current with its then monthly capital contributions), pursuant to the Patent Agreement, Movychem will transfer all of its rights, title and interest to all of the patents related to Retacell for an amount equal to aggregate cash contributions of the Company to the Joint Venture plus 40% of all royalty payments received by the Joint Venture for the licensing of Retacell products. Pending assignment of the patents to the Joint Venture, pursuant to the Patent Agreement, Movychem has granted to the Joint Venture an exclusive worldwide license under the patents.   Concurrently with the execution of the Joint Venture Agreement, the Joint Venture will provide to the Joint Venture technical services related to the exploitation of the Retacell intellectual property and corporate, marketing, business development, communications and administrative services as requested by the Joint Venture in exchange for 40% of all royalty payments received by the Joint Venture for the licensing of Retacell products.   Under the Joint Venture Agreement, the Company has agreed to grant to certain individuals affiliated with Movychem five-year warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase an aggregate of
170,000,000
shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $ 0.01
per share with vesting depending on the satisfaction of various milestones as described therein.   The Joint Venture Agreement grants to Movychem the right to dissolve the Joint Venture in the event that the Company fails to make any of its capital contributions in which case the Joint Venture will be required to grant back to Movychem all joint venture intellectual property and the assignment to Movychem of any outstanding licenses. Additionally, the Services Agreement will be amended to provide that the 40% of royalties to be paid by to the Company will be limited to licensees who were first introduced to the Joint Venture or Movychem, as the case may be.   The Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810 Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The Joint Venture qualifies as a VIE based on the fact the JV does not have sufficient equity to operate without financial support from both parties. According to ASC 810-25-38, a reporting entity shall consolidate a VIE when that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the reporting entity with a controlling financial interest on the basis of the provisions in paragraphs 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J. The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that VIE. According to the JV operating agreement, the ownership interests are 50/50 and the agreement provides for a Management Committee of five members. Two of the five members are from Xeriant and Movychem, respectively and one is appointed by mutual agreement of the parties. Movychem is transferring to the Joint Venture all of its interest to the know-how and intellectual property relating to Retacell exclusive of all patents, and the Company is contributing cash. As such, both parties do not have substantial capital at risk. Based on these two factors, the conclusion is that no one is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, Xeriant has not consolidated the VIE.   As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company contributed $ 280,656
and $ 115,356
to the joint venture, respectively.
F-12 Table of Contents   NOTE 4 – CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS   The Company maintains accounts with financial institutions. All cash in checking accounts is non-interest bearing and is fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). At times, cash balances may exceed the maximum coverage provided by the FDIC on insured depositor accounts. The Company believes it mitigates its risk by depositing its cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions. On December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had $ 0
and $ 811,429
in excess of FDIC insurance, respectively.   NOTE 5 – OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITY   The Company leases 2,911 square feet of office space located in the Research Park at Florida Atlantic University, Innovation Centre 1, 3998 FAU Boulevard, Suite 309, Boca Raton, Florida.
The Company entered into a lease agreement commencing on November 1, 2019 through January 1, 2025 in which the first three months of rent were abated. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company decided to have all employees work from home and intends to build out the office space by the end of March 2023 to allow employees to work from the office in April of 2023. The following table illustrates the base rent amounts over the term of the lease:   Base Rent Periods   November 1, 2019 to October 31, 2020   $ 4,367   November 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021   $ 4,498   November 1, 2021 to October 31, 2022   $ 4,633   November 1, 2022 to October 31, 2023   $ 4,772   November 1, 2023 to October 31, 2024   $ 4,915   November 1, 2024 to January 31, 2025   $ 5,063     Operating lease right-of-use asset and liability are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value is our incremental borrowing rate, estimated to be

The warrants have a term of five years and an exercise price of $ 0.1187 . The warrants were recorded at fair value of $ 2,777,081  to additional-paid-in-capital in accordance with ASC 815-10 based upon the allocation of the debt proceeds. The Company estimated the fair value of the warrants using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which is based, in part, upon subjective assumptions including but not limited to stock price volatility, the expected life of the warrants, the risk-free interest rate and the fair value of the common stock underlying the warrants. The Company estimates the volatility of its stock based on the average of three similar size public companies peer group historical volatility that is in line with the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bond for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected remaining life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term.   The Company was required to determine if the debt contained a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”), which is based on the intrinsic value on the date of issuance. The Company recorded $ 2,365,419  conversion feature in additional paid-in capital.

We seek to partner with and acquire strategic interests in visionary companies that accelerate this mission. The Company is located at the Research Park at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida.   JV with XTI Aircraft   On May 31, 2021, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the “Agreement”) with XTI Aircraft Company (“XTI”), a Delaware corporation, to form a new company, called Eco-Aero, LLC (the “JV”), a Delaware limited liability company, with the purpose of completing the preliminary design of XTI’s TriFan 600, a 5-passenger plus pilot, hybrid electric, vertical takeoff, and landing (eVTOL) fixed wing aircraft. Under the Agreement, Xeriant is contributing capital, technology, and strategic business relationships, and XTI is contributing intellectual property licensing rights and know-how. XTI and the Company each own 50 percent of the JV. The JV is managed by a management committee consisting of five members, three appointed by the Company and two by XTI. The Agreement was effective on June 4, 2021, with an initial deposit of $1 million into the JV. Xeriant’s financial commitment is up to $10 million, contributed as needed based on the aircraft development timeline and budget.     5 Table of Contents   The Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810 Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The Joint Venture qualifies as a VIE based on the fact the JV does not have sufficient equity to operate without financial support from Xeriant. According to ASC 810-25-38, a reporting entity shall consolidate a VIE when that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the reporting entity with a controlling financial interest on the basis of the provisions in paragraphs 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J. The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that VIE. According to the JV operating agreement, the ownership interests are 50/50. However, the agreement provides for a Management Committee of five members. Three of the five members are from Xeriant. Additionally, Xeriant has the right to invest up to $10,000,000 into the JV. As such, Xeriant has substantial capital at risk. Based on these two factors, the conclusion is that Xeriant is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, Xeriant has consolidated the VIE.   Recent Developments
JV with Movychem   On April 2, 2022 (Amended November 7, 2022), the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Movychem s.r.o., a Slovakian limited liability company setting forth the terms for the establishment of a joint venture (the “Joint Venture”) to develop applications and commercialize a series of flame-retardant products in the form of polymer gels, powders, liquids and pellets derived from technology developed by Movychem under the name Retacell ™ . The Joint Venture is organized as a Florida limited liability company under the name Ebenberg, LLC and is owned 50% by each of the Company and Movychem.   For its capital contribution to the Joint Venture, pursuant to a Patent and Exclusive License and Assignment Agreement (the “Patent Agreement”), Movychem is transferring to the Joint Venture all of its interest to the know-how and intellectual property relating to Retacell exclusive of all patents, and the Company is contributing the amount of $2,600,000 payable (a) $600,000 at the rate of $25,000 per month over a 24 month period and (b) $2,000,000 within five business days of a closing of a financing in which the Company receives net proceeds of at least $3,000,000 but in no event later than February 15, 2023. The Company is currently in discussions with Movychem with the intent of extending the February 15, 2023 date.  At such time as the Company makes its $2,000,000 payment (and assuming the Company is current with its then monthly capital contributions), pursuant to the Patent Agreement, Movychem will transfer all of its rights, title and interest to all of the patents related to Retacell for an amount equal to aggregate cash contributions of the Company to the Joint Venture plus 40% of all royalty payments received by the Joint Venture for the licensing of Retacell products. Pending assignment of the patents to the Joint Venture, pursuant to the Patent Agreement, Movychem has granted to the Joint Venture an exclusive worldwide license under the patents.   Concurrently with the execution of the Joint Venture Agreement, the Joint Venture has entered into a Services Agreement (the “Services Agreement”) with the Company pursuant to which the Company will provide to the Joint Venture technical services related to the exploitation of the Retacell intellectual property and corporate, marketing. business development, communications and administrative services as requested by the Joint Venture in exchange for 40% of all royalty payments received by the Joint Venture for the licensing of Retacell products.   Under the Joint Venture Agreement, the Company has agreed to grant to certain individuals affiliated with Movychem five-year warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase an aggregate of 170,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share with vesting depending on the satisfaction of various milestones as described therein.   The Joint Venture Agreement grants to Movychem the right to dissolve the Joint Venture in the event that the Company fails to make any of its capital contributions in which case the Joint Venture will be required to grant back to Movychem all joint venture intellectual property and the assignment to Movychem of any outstanding licenses. Additionally, the Services Agreement will be amended to provide that the 40% of royalties to be paid by to the Company will be limited to licensees who were first introduced to the Joint Venture or Movychem, as the case may be.   The Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810 Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The Joint Venture qualifies as a VIE based on the fact the JV does not have sufficient equity to operate without financial support from both parties. According to ASC 810-25-38, a reporting entity shall consolidate a VIE when that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the reporting entity with a controlling financial interest on the basis of the provisions in paragraphs 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J. The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that VIE. According to the JV operating agreement, the ownership interests are 50/50 and the agreement provides for a Management Committee of five members. Two of the five members are from Xeriant and Movychem, respectively and one is appointed by mutual agreement of the parties. Movychem is transferring to the Joint Venture all of its interest to the know-how and intellectual property relating to Retacell exclusive of all patents, and the Company is contributing cash. As such, both parties do not have substantial capital at risk. Based on these two factors, the conclusion is that no one is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, Xeriant has not consolidated the VIE.   As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company contributed $280,656 and $115,356 to the joint venture, respectively.

These research and development expenses were in connection with our Eco-Aero, LLC joint venture with XTI Aircraft Company for funding the preliminary design phase in the development of an aircraft, called the TriFan 600. There were no expenses for the joint venture for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Research & Development Expenses relating to Movychem/Ebenberg JV are accounted for through Ebenberg, LLC.   Other Income (Expenses)   Total other expenses consist of amortization of debt discount related to convertible notes, interest expense related to convertible notes, and a loss on settlement of debt. Total other expenses were $4,836,879 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1,462,259 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to recording the amortization of debt discount from the Auctus convertible note signed in October 2021 and the loss on extinguishment of debt due to the Auctus Note modification.   Net loss   Total net loss was $6,111,883 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $9,974,398 for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily related amortization of debt discount of $1,413,959 and $5,200,219 of research and development expenses in the prior period versus $0 of research and development expenses and $461,842 of amortization of debt discount in the current period. The difference was partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $4,259,987 for the current period.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   As of December 31, 2022, we had a cash balance of $119,593 and a working deficit of $5,947,132. Our net loss of $6,111,883 in the six months ended December 31, 2022 was mostly funded by proceeds raised from financings. We will need to raise working capital (or refinance existing short-term debt to long-term debt) to fund operations. Future equity financings may be dilutive to our stockholders. Alternative forms of future financings may include preferences or rights superior to our common stock. Debt financings may involve a pledge of assets and will rank senior to our common stock. We have historically financed our operations through best- efforts private equity and debt financings. We do not have any credit or equity facilities available with financial institutions, stockholders or third-party investors, and will continue to rely on best efforts financings. The failure to raise sufficient capital will likely cause us to cease operations.   During the six months ended December 31, 2022, our operating activities used $943,785 of net cash used compared to using $6,013,001 of net cash used in our operating activities during the six months ended December 31 2021. This difference primarily related to a decrease in stock-based compensation and stock issued for services offset by higher amortization of debt discount and loss on settlement of debt.   Funding Strategy   To date, our operations have been funded primarily through private investors. Some of these investors have verbally committed additional funding for the Company, as needed. We have had a number of discussions with broker-dealers regarding the funding required to execute the Company’s business plan, which is to acquire and develop breakthrough technologies or business interests in those companies that have developed these technologies. An S-1 Registration Statement was filed on January 18, 2023, for the purpose of raising capital for the Company to execute its business plan.  No assurance can be given that funds will be available, or, if available, will be on terms acceptable to The Company.   Off Balance Sheet Items   We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as “special purpose entities” (SPEs).     9 Table of Contents   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   As a smaller reporting company, the Company has elected not to provide the disclosure required by this item.   Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Our management is responsible for maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Registrant files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
