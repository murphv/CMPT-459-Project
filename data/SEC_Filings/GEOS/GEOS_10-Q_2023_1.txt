GEOSPACE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)
1.
Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated balance sheet of Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at September 30, 2022 was derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements at that date.
The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 and the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were prepared by the Company without audit.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows were made.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for a full year or of future operations. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S.") were omitted pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company’s fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
The Company considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements. The Company continually evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debt reserves, collectability of rental revenue, inventory obsolescence reserves, self-insurance reserves, product warranty reserves, useful lives of long-lived assets, impairment of long-lived assets, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, contingent consideration and deferred income tax assets.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
While management believes current estimates are reasonable and appropriate, actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity at the time of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
At December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company had restricted cash of $ 0.2
million on deposit with a bank, which serves as collateral on employee issued credit cards.
At December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents included $ 2.9
million held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and branch offices, including $ 2.2
million held by its subsidiary in the Russian Federation.
In response to sanctions imposed by the U.S. and others on Russia, the Russian government has imposed restrictions on companies' abilities to repatriate or otherwise remit cash from their Russian-based operations to locations outside of Russia.
As a result, this cash can be used in our Russian operations, but the Company may be unable to transfer it out of Russia without incurring substantial costs, if at all.
In addition, if the Company were to repatriate the cash held by its Russian subsidiary, it would be required to accrue and pay taxes on any amount repatriated.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets The Company's long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or circumstance indicates that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.
The impairment review, if necessary, includes a comparison of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying value of the related assets. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.
During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, no events or changes in circumstances were identified indicating the carrying value of any of the Company's asset groups may not be recoverable.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In
June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued guidance surrounding credit losses for financial instruments that replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in generally accepted accounting principles.
The new impairment model requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other financial instruments.
For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, credit losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities.
As a smaller reporting company, the Company must adopt this standard no later than the first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, although early adoption is permitted.
The standard’s provisions will be
8
applied
as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective reporting period.
The Company intends to adopt this standard during the first quarter of its fiscal year ending September 30, 2024 and is continuing to evaluate the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
2.
Revenue Recognition In accordance with ASC Topic 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(“ASC 606”), the Company recognizes revenue when performance of contractual obligations are satisfied, generally when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company primarily derives product revenue from the sale of its manufactured products.
Revenue from these product sales, including the sale of used rental equipment, is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, control is transferred and collectability of the sales price is probable.
The Company records deferred revenue when customer funds are received prior to shipment or delivery or performance has not yet occurred. The Company assesses collectability during the contract assessment phase. In situations where collectability of the sales price is not probable, the Company recognizes revenue when it determines that collectability is probable or when non-refundable cash is received from its customers and there is not a significant right of return.
Transfer of control generally occurs with shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the underlying contract.
The Company’s products are generally sold without any customer acceptance provisions, and the Company’s standard terms of sale do not allow customers to return products for credit.
Revenue from engineering services is recognized as services are rendered over the duration of a project, or as billed on a per hour basis.
Field service revenue is recognized when services are rendered and is generally priced on a per day rate. The Company also generates revenue from short-term rentals under operating leases of its manufactured products.
Rental revenue is recognized as earned over the rental period if collectability of the rent is reasonably assured.
Rentals of the Company’s equipment generally range from daily rentals to minimum rental periods of up to one year. The Company has determined that ASC 606 does not apply to rental contracts, which are within the scope of ASC Topic 842,
Leases .
As permissible under ASC 606, sales taxes and transaction-based taxes are excluded from revenue.
The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. Additionally, the Company expenses costs incurred to obtain contracts when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less.
These costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company has elected to treat shipping and handling activities in a sales transaction after the customer obtains control of the goods as a fulfillment cost and not as a promised service. Accordingly, fulfillment costs related to the shipping and handling of goods are accrued at the time of shipment. Amounts billed to a customer in a sales transaction related to reimbursable shipping and handling costs are included in revenue and the associated costs incurred by the Company for reimbursable shipping and handling expenses are reported in cost of revenue.
At December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the Company had
no
deferred contract costs or deferred contract liabilities.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
no
revenue was recognized from deferred contract liabilities and
no
cost of revenue was recognized from deferred contract costs.
At December 31, 2022, the Company had no unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration of one year or less.
For each of the Company’s operating segments, the following table presents revenue only from the sale of products and the performance of services under contracts with customers (in thousands).
Therefore, the table excludes all revenue earned from rental contracts. 9

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments generally include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts and notes receivable and accounts payable.
Due to the short-term maturities of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivable and accounts payable, the carrying amounts of these financial instruments are deemed to approximate their fair value on the respective balance sheet dates.
The valuation technique used to measure the fair value of the contingent consideration was based on internal estimates and the use of internal projections of future revenue.
The Company measures its short-term investments and contingent consideration at fair value on a recurring basis. The following tables present the fair value of the Company’s short-term investments and contingent consideration by valuation hierarchy and input (in thousands):

Leases
As Lessee The Company has elected not to record operating right-of-use assets or operating lease liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet for leases having a minimum term of 12 months or less.
Such leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Variable lease payments are excluded from the measurement of operating right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has
two
operating right-of-use assets related to leased facilities in Austin, Texas and Melbourne, Florida.
Maturities of the operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022 were as follows: (in thousands):

The discount rate used on the operating right-of-use assets represented the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at lease inception. As Lessor Equipment The Company leases equipment to customers which generally range from daily rentals to minimum rental periods of up to
one year .
All of the Company’s current leasing arrangements, which the Company acting as lessor, are classified as operating leases.
The majority of the Company’s rental revenue is generated from its marine-based wireless seismic data acquisition systems.

The Company regularly evaluates the collectability of its lease receivables on a lease-by-lease basis.
The evaluation primarily consists of reviewing past due account balances and other factors such as the credit quality of the customer, historical trends of the customer and current economic conditions.
The Company suspends revenue recognition when the collectability of amounts due are no longer probable and concurrently records a direct write-off of the lease receivable to rental revenue and limits future rental revenue recognition to cash received.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s trade accounts receivables included lease receivables of $ 9.0
million. Rental revenue related to leased equipment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 11.5
million and $ 4.9
million, respectively.
Future minimum lease obligations due from the Company’s leasing customers on operating leases executed as of December 30, 2022 were $ 27.1

million attributable to its Emerging Markets reporting unit; and other intangible assets, net of $ 1.4
million attributable to its Oil and Gas Markets reporting unit.
Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquired over the fair market value of identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition.
At December 31, 2022, the Company determined there were no triggering events requiring an impairment assessment of its goodwill and other intangible assets.
The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter.
If the Company determines that the future cash flows anticipated to be generated from its reporting units will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the respective reporting unit, it will need to recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill.
Other intangible asset amortization expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 0.2

Long-Term Debt
The Company had
no
long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. In May 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Agreement”) with Amerisource Funding, Inc, as administrative agent and as a lender, and Woodforest National Bank, as a lender.
Available borrowings under the Agreement are determined by a borrowing base with a maximum availability of $ 10
million.
The borrowing base is determined based upon certain of the Company's domestic assets which include (i)
70 % loan to value of the Company's property located at 6410 Langfield Road in
Houston, Texas (the “Property”), (ii)
50 % of forced liquidation value of equipment, (iii)
80 % of certain accounts receivable and (iv)
50 %
of forced liquidation
15
value
of certain inventory (inventory borrowing base limited to
100 % of borrowing base credit given toward accounts receivable).
The Agreement is for a
two-year
term with all funds borrowed due at the expiration of the term.
The interest rate on borrowed funds is the Wall Street prime rate (with a minimum of
3.25 %) plus
4.00 %. The Company is required to make monthly interest payments on borrowed funds.
Borrowings under the Agreement will be principally secured by the Property and the Company's domestic equipment, inventory and accounts receivables.
In addition, certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company have guaranteed the obligations of the Company under the Agreement and such subsidiaries have secured the obligations by pledging certain assets.
The Agreement requires the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of $ 100
million.
At December 31, 2022, the Company was compliant with all covenants under the Agreement and its borrowing availability was $ 8.5
million.
As discussed in Note 7, the Property is under contract to sell at December 31, 2022.
The Company is currently in discussions with its lenders to collateralize the Agreement with alternative domestic assets.
Debt issuance costs of $ 0.2
million were incurred in connection with the Agreement.
These costs were capitalized in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Agreement.
11.
Stock-Based Compensation During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued
174,250
restricted stock units (“RSUs”) under its 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended.
The RSUs issued include both time-based and performance-based vesting provisions.
The weighted average grant date fair value of each RSU was $ 4.50
per unit.
The grant date fair value of the RSUs was $ 0.8
million, which will be charged to expense over the next
four years
as the restrictions lapse.
Compensation expense for the RSUs was determined based on the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant applied to the total number of units that are anticipated to fully vest.
Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock upon vesting.
As of December 31, 2022, there were
382,111
RSUs outstanding.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had unrecognized compensation expense of $ 2.2
million relating to RSUs that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
3.1
years.

Commitments and Contingencies   Contingent Compensation Costs In connection with the acquisition of Aquana, LLC (“Aquana”) in July 2021, the Company is subject to additional contingent cash payments to the former members of Aquana over a
six-year
earn-out
period.
The contingent payments, if any, will be derived from certain eligible revenue generated during the earn-out period from products and services sold by Aquana.
There is no maximum limit to the contingent cash payments that could be made.
The merger agreement with Aquana requires the continued employment of a certain
16
key
employee and former member of Aquana for the first four years of the six year earn-out period in order for any of Aquana’s former members to be eligible for any earn-out payments.
Due to the continued employment requirement, no liability has been recorded for the estimated fair value of earn-out payments for this transaction.
Earn-outs achieved, if any, will be recorded as compensation expense when incurred.
Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in various pending legal actions in the ordinary course of its business.
Management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, because of the inherent uncertainty of such actions.
However, management believes that the most probable, ultimate resolution of current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Risks and Uncertainties
Concentration of Credit Risk As of December 31, 2022, the Company had combined trade accounts and notes receivable from
four
customers of $ 9.2
million, $ 6.0
million, $ 4.1
million and $ 4.0
million, respectively.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, revenue recognized from these
four
customers was $ 8.0
million, $ 2.7
million, $ 4.0
million and $ 1.7
million, respectively.
During the three months ended December 31, 2021, revenue recognized from these
four
customers was $ 3.2
million, $ 0.7
million,
zero , and $ 4.6
million, respectively.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe and has negatively impacted worldwide economic activity and continues to create challenges in the Company’s markets.
COVID-19 and the related mitigation measures have disrupted the Company’s supply chain, resulting in longer lead times in materials available from suppliers and extended the shipping time for these materials to
17
reach the Company’s facilities. If COVID–19 continues to spread or the response to contain the COVID–19 pandemic is unsuccessful, the Company could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
Oil Commodity Price Levels Demand for many of the Company’s products and the profitability of its operations depend primarily on the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activity.
Prevailing oil and gas prices, with an emphasis on crude oil prices, and market expectations regarding potential changes in such prices significantly affect the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activity.
During periods of improved energy commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which results in increased demand for our customers services leading to increased demand in the Company’s products.
Conversely, in periods when these energy commodity prices deteriorate, capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to contract causing demand for the Company’s products to weaken.
Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are subject to wide fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond its control.
These factors include the level of consumer demand, regional and international economic conditions, weather conditions, domestic and foreign governmental regulations (including those related to climate change), price and availability of alternative fuels, political conditions, the war between Russian and Ukraine, instability and hostilities in the Middle East and other significant oil-producing regions, increases and decreases in the supply of oil and gas, the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC') to set and maintain production levels and prices of foreign imports.
Crude oil prices held above $ 70
per barrel throughout 2022 , which may result in higher cash flows for exploration and production companies. Any material changes in oil and gas prices or other market trends, like slowing growth of the global economy, could adversely impact seismic exploration activity and would likely affect the demand for the Company's products and could materially and adversely affect its results of operations and liquidity.   Generally, imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and gas will affect oil and gas prices and, in such circumstances, demand for the Company’s oil and gas products may be adversely affected when world supplies exceed demand.   Armed Conflict Between Russia and Ukraine A portion of the Company's oil and gas product manufacturing is conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary Geospace Technologies Eurasia LLC ("GTE"), which is based in the Russian Federation.
In February 2022, the Russian Federation launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, and Russia and Ukraine continue to engage in active and armed conflict.
Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions in addition to any direct impact on the Company's operations in Russia.
As a result of the invasion, the governments of several western nations, including the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union, implemented new and/or expanded economic sanctions and export restrictions against Russia, Russian-backed separatist regions in Ukraine, certain banks, companies, government officials, and other individuals in Russia and Belarus.
The implementation of these sanctions and exports restrictions, in combination with the withdrawal of numerous private companies from the Russian market, has had, and is likely to continue to have, a negative impact on the Company's business in the region.
In fiscal year 2022, the Company imported $ 1.9
million of products from GTE for resale elsewhere in the world.
The rapid changes in rules and implementation of new rules on imports and exports of goods involving Russia has also led to serious delays in getting goods to or from Russia as port authorities struggle to keep up with the changing environment.
If imports of these products from the Russian Federation are restricted by government regulation, the Company may be forced to find other sources for the manufacturing of these products at potentially higher costs. Likewise, restrictions on the Company's ability to send products to our subsidiary in Russia, may force our subsidiary to have to find other sources for the manufacturing of these products at potentially higher costs; however, the Company's exports to GTE have historically been limited.
Boycotts, protests, unfavorable regulations, additional governmental sanctions and other actions in the region could also adversely affect the Company's ability to operate profitably. Delays in obtaining governmental approvals can affect the Company's ability to timely deliver its products pursuant to contractual obligations, which could result in the Company being liable to its customers for damages. The risk of doing business in the Russian Federation and other economically or politically volatile areas could adversely affect the Company's operations and earnings.
It is possible that increasing sanctions, export controls, restrictions on access to financial institutions, supply and transportation challenges, or other circumstances or considerations could necessitate a reduction, or even discontinuation, of operations by GTE or other business in Russia.
The Company is actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine and Russia and assessing its impact on its business, including
GTE. The net carrying value of this subsidiary on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 was $ 5.5
million, including cash of $ 2.2
million.
In response to sanctions imposed by the U.S. and others on Russia, the Russian government has imposed restrictions on companies' abilities to repatriate or otherwise remit cash from their Russian-based operations to locations outside of Russia.
As a result, this cash can be used in our Russian operations, but we may be unable to transfer it out of Russia without incurring substantial costs, if at all.
In addition to the $ 1.9
million
of products the Company imported from GTE in fiscal year 2022, the subsidiary generated
18
$ 1.9
million in revenue from domestic sales in fiscal year 2022.
The Company has no way to predict the duration, progress or outcome of the military conflict in Ukraine. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions, and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the global economy and the Company's business for an unknown period of time.
17.
Exit and Disposal Activities
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company implemented a plan to discontinue the manufacture of certain low margin, low revenue products and reconfigure our production facilities to lower our costs and raise efficiencies.
As part of the plan, reductions were made to the Company's workforce which are expected to yield an annual savings of more than $ 2
million.
In connection with the plan, the Company incurred costs of $ 0.6
million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, primarily termination costs related to the workforce reduction.
The costs were recorded both to cost of revenue and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
No significant future costs are expected.
Outstanding liabilities related to the plan was $ 0.2
million as of December 31, 2022.

Business Overview
Unless otherwise specified, the discussion in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refers to Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries.
We principally design and manufacture seismic instruments and equipment.
These seismic products are marketed to the oil and gas industry and used to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs.
We also market our seismic products to other industries for vibration monitoring, border and perimeter security and various geotechnical applications.
We design and manufacture other products of a non-seismic nature, including water meter products, imaging equipment, remote shutoff water valves and Internet of Things ("IoT") platform and provide contract manufacturing services.
We report and categorize our customers and products into three different segments:
Oil and Gas Markets, Adjacent Markets and Emerging Markets.
In recent years, the revenue contribution from our Adjacent Markets segment has grown to represent nearly half of our total revenue.
This revenue growth is reflective of both our diversification strategy as well as the continued downturn in the Oil and Gas Markets segment.
Demand for our seismic products targeted at customers in our Oil and Gas Markets segment has been, and will likely continue to be, vulnerable to downturns in the economy and the oil and gas industry in general.

Products and Product Development
Oil and Gas Markets
Our Oil and Gas Markets business segment has historically accounted for the majority of our revenue.
Geoscientists use seismic data primarily in connection with the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves to map potential and known hydrocarbon bearing formations and the geologic structures that surround them.
This segment’s products include wireless seismic data acquisition systems, reservoir characterization products and services, and traditional seismic exploration products such as geophones, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various other seismic products.
We believe that our Oil and Gas Markets products are among the most technologically advanced instruments and equipment available for seismic data acquisition.
Traditional Products
An energy source and a data recording system are combined to acquire seismic data.
We provide many of the components of seismic data recording systems, including geophones, hydrophones, multi-component sensors, leader wire, geophone strings, connectors, seismic telemetry cables and other seismic related products.
On land, our customers use geophones, leader wire, cables and connectors to receive and measure seismic reflections resulting from an energy source into data recording units, which store the seismic information for subsequent processing and analysis.
In the marine environment, large ocean-going vessels tow long seismic cables known as “streamers” containing hydrophones that are used to detect pressure changes.
Hydrophones transmit electrical impulses back to the vessel’s data recording unit where the seismic data is stored for subsequent processing and analysis.
Our marine seismic products also help steer streamers while being towed and help recover streamers if they become disconnected from the vessel.
Our seismic sensor, cable and connector products are compatible with most major competitive seismic data acquisition systems currently in use.
Revenue from these products results primarily from seismic contractors purchasing our products as components of new seismic data acquisition systems or to repair and replace components of seismic data acquisition systems already in use.
Wireless Products
We have developed multiple versions of a land-based wireless (or nodal) seismic data acquisition system.
Rather than utilizing interconnecting cables as required by most traditional land data acquisition systems, each of our wireless stations operate as an independent data collection system, allowing for virtually unlimited channel configurations.
As a result, our wireless systems require less maintenance, which we believe allows our customers to operate more effectively and efficiently because of its reduced environmental impact, lower weight and ease of operation.
Each wireless station is available in a single-channel or three-channel configuration.
Since its introduction in 2008 and through December 31, 2022, we have sold 500,000 wireless channels and we currently have 63,000 wireless channels in our rental fleet.
We have also developed a marine-based wireless seismic data acquisition system called the OBX.
Similar to our land-based wireless systems, the marine OBX system may be deployed in virtually unlimited channel configurations and does not require interconnecting cables between each station.
We have two versions of OBX nodal stations.
A shallow water version that can be used in depths up to 750 meters and a deepwater version that can be deployed in depths of up to 3,450 meters.
Through December 31, 2022, we have sold 13,000 OBX stations and we currently have 24,000 OBX stations in our rental fleet.
In August 2022, we announced the release of a new seismic acquisition product known as Mariner™, a continuous, cable-free, four channel autonomous, shallow water ocean bottom recorder. Mariner is the next generation node designed for extended duration seabed ocean bottom seismic data acquisition. The slim profile nodes, which are part of our shallow water stations, are ideally deployed as deep as 750 meters. The device continuously records for up to 70 days and offers more rapid recharging times. Its slim profile creates space savings on seismic survey vessels, allowing contractors to fit up to 25% more nodes into a download/charge container.
Reservoir Products
Seismic surveys repeated over selected time intervals show dynamic changes within a producing oil and gas reservoir, and operators can use these surveys to monitor the effects of oil and gas development and production.
This type of reservoir monitoring requires special purpose or custom designed systems in which portability becomes less critical and functional reliability assumes greater importance.
This reliability factor helps assure successful operations in inaccessible locations over a considerable period of time.
Additionally, reservoirs located in deep water or harsh environments require special instrumentation and new techniques to maximize recovery.
Reservoir monitoring also requires high-bandwidth, high-resolution seismic data for engineering project planning and
21
reservoir management.
Utilizing these reservoir monitoring tools, producers can enhance the recovery of oil and gas deposits over the life of a reservoir.
We have developed permanently installed high-definition reservoir monitoring systems for land and ocean-bottom applications in producing oil and gas fields.
Our electrical reservoir monitoring systems are currently installed on numerous offshore reservoirs in the North Sea and elsewhere.
Through our acquisition of the OptoSeis ®
fiber optic sensing technology, we now offer both electrical and fiber optic reservoir monitoring systems.
These high-definition seismic data acquisition systems have a flexible architecture allowing them to be configured as a subsurface system for both land and marine reservoir-monitoring projects.
The scalable architecture of these systems enables custom designed configuration for applications ranging from low-channel engineering and environmental-scale surveys requiring a minimum number of recording channels to high-channel surveys required to efficiently conduct permanent reservoir monitoring (“PRM”).
The modular architecture of these products allows virtually unlimited channel expansion for these systems.
In addition, we produce seismic borehole acquisition systems that employ a fiber optic augmented wireline capable of very high data transmission rates.
These systems are used for several reservoir monitoring applications, including an application pioneered by us allowing operators and service companies to monitor and measure the results of hydraulic fracturing operations.
We believe our reservoir characterization products make seismic acquisition a cost-effective and reliable process for reservoir monitoring.
Our multi-component seismic product developments also include an omni-directional geophone for use in reservoir monitoring, a compact marine three-component or four-component gimbaled sensor and special-purpose connectors, connector arrays and cases.
During 2022, we have maintained active discussions with potential clients for future PRM systems.
In coordination with a potential client, we concluded a successful demonstration of our OptoSeis ®
fiber optic PRM technology in real-world field conditions.
This demonstration was a pre-requisite step toward future contract consideration.
If we are awarded a PRM contract in fiscal year 2023, revenue will most likely not be recognized until fiscal year 2024.
We have also held discussions and received requests for information from other major oil and gas producers regarding PRM systems. We have not received any orders for a large-scale seabed PRM system since November 2012.
Adjacent Markets
Our Adjacent Markets businesses leverage upon existing manufacturing facilities and engineering capabilities utilized by our Oil and Gas Markets businesses.
Many of the seismic products in our Oil and Gas Markets segment, with little or no modification, have direct application to other industries.
Our business diversification strategy has centered largely on translating expertise in ruggedized engineering and manufacturing into expanded customer markets. To bolster the solid market share we have established in the water utility market for water meter cables, in fiscal year 2021, we acquired the smart water IoT company, Aquana, LLC ("Aquana").
Industrial Products
Our industrial products include water meter products, remote shut-off water valves and IoT Platform, contract manufacturing services and seismic sensors used for vibration monitoring.
Our water meter products support the global smart meter connectivity water utility market.
Our products provide our customers with highly reliable automated meter-reading and automated meter infrastructure with our robust water-proof connectors.
Our field splice kits allow for accelerated repairs once identified.
Our water IoT platform and remote-shut off valve allows customers that manage multi-family and commercial properties to monitor their properties for leak and burst events, with real-time notifications, complimented with our remote-shut off to stop water damage.
These products also allow water utilities to control and monitor water use remotely, discontinue or limit service without placing its employees in potential harm or danger.
Our robust manufacturing capabilities have allowed us to provide specialized contract manufacturing services for printed circuit board manufacturing, cabling and harnesses, machining, injection molding and electronic system assembly.
Our seismic sensors provide unique high definition, low frequency sensing that allows for vibration monitoring in industrial machinery, mine safety and earthquake detection.
Imaging Products
22
Our imaging products include electronic pre-press products that employ direct thermal imaging, direct-to-screen printing systems, and digital inkjet printing technologies targeted at the commercial graphics, industrial graphics, textile and flexographic printing industries.
Emerging Markets
Our Emerging Markets business segment consists entirely of our Quantum business.
Quantum’s product line includes a proprietary detection system called SADAR ® , which detects, locates and tracks items of interest in real-time.
Using the SADAR ®
technology, Quantum designs and sells products used for border and perimeter security surveillance, cross-border tunneling detection and other products targeted at movement monitoring, intrusion detection and situational awareness.
SADAR's technology also provides passive seismic real-time monitoring in emerging energy applications such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and geothermal energy. Quantum's customers include various agencies of the U.S. government including the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security and other agencies as well as energy companies needing real-time monitoring of seismic data..

Overview
Although in an already depressed oil and gas industry, demand further decreased in February 2020 because of the oversupply of crude oil due to failed OPEC negotiations that led to a dramatic drop in crude oil prices when combined with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
These declines in the demand for oil and gas have caused oil and gas exploration and production companies to experience a significant reduction in cash flows, which have resulted in reductions in their capital spending budgets for oil and gas exploration-focused activities, including seismic data acquisition activities.
Crude oil prices held above $70 per barrel throughout 2022; however, a lag in time typically occurs between higher oil prices and greater demand for our Oil and Gas Markets segment products.
We believe this lag is the result of exploration and production (“E&P”) companies allocating their cash flow towards shareholder reward initiatives, such as stock buy-back programs and dividend payments, or in debt reduction.
We believe this lag is a short-term trend that will continue until E&P companies decide to reinvest capital into exploration activities.
As this lag persists, we expect the reduced levels of demand for our Oil and Gas Markets segment products and our rental marine wireless nodal products to continue.
We also expect our land-based traditional and wireless products will continue to experience low levels of product demand until our customers consume their excess levels of underutilized equipment.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we began to experience an increase in rental demand for our marine nodal products in the form of additional rental contracts and requests for quotes from existing and new customers.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we implemented a plan to discontinue the manufacture of certain low margin, low revenue products and reconfigure our production facilities to lower our costs and raise efficiencies.
As part of the plan, reductions were made to our workforce which are expected to yield an annual savings of more than $2 million.
In connection with the plan, we incurred costs of $0.6 million in ther first quarter of fiscal year 2023, primarily termination costs related to the workforce reduction.
The costs were recorded both to cost of revenue and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
No significant future costs are expected.
In light of current market conditions, the inventory balances in our Oil and Gas Markets business segment at December 31, 2022 continued to exceed levels we consider appropriate for the current level of product demand.
We are continuing to work aggressively to reduce these legacy inventory balances; however, we are also adding new inventories for new wireless product developments and for other product demand in our Adjacent Markets segment.
During periods of excessive inventory levels, our policy has been, and will continue to be, to record obsolescence expense as we experience reduced product demand and as our inventories continue to age.
As difficult market conditions continue for the products in our Oil and Gas Markets segment, we are recording additional expenses for inventory obsolescence and will continue to do so in the future until product demand and/or resulting inventory turnover return to acceptable levels.
Armed Conflict Between Russia and Ukraine
A portion of our oil and gas product manufacturing is conducted by Geopace Technologies Eurasia LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary based in the Russian Federation.
Consequently, our oil and gas business could be directly affected by the current war between Russia and Ukraine. See Note 16 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information.
Coronavirus (COVID-19)
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted worldwide economic activity and continues to create challenges in our markets, such as uncertainties regarding the duration and extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately have a negative impact on the demand for our products and services or on our supply chain.
We continue to closely monitor the situation as information becomes readily available.
During
the fiscal year 2022, our operations have, for the most part, remained open globally and the impact of the effects of COVID-19 to our personnel and operations has been limited.
Our supply chain has become increasingly strained due to increased pricing for raw material and supplies coupled with longer than expected lead times.
We initially experienced a reduction in demand for the rental of our OBX marine nodal products, which we believed was primarily the result of the pandemic; however, demand has increased in fiscal year 2022.
We also
believe our Adjacent Markets business segment has entered into a period of recovery from the initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we continue to be cautious about the pandemic’s effect on our other business segments and our supply chain.
As a result,
we continually communicate with our suppliers and customers as information is available to best manage this difficult situation
Three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021
Consolidated revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $31.1 million, an increase of $13.1 million, or 72.9%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase was largely attributable to higher revenue from our Oil and Gas Markets segment, primarily due to increased utilization of our OBX rental fleet and higher wireless exploration product revenue.
Wireless exploration product revenue included $4.0 million from a rental customer as compensation for lost OBX nodes.
The increase in consolidated revenue was also caused by an increase in sales of industrial products from our Adjacent Markets segment.
24
Consolidated gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $10.5 million, an increase of $8.8 million from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase was primarily due to higher gross profits from the increased utilization of our OBX rental fleet and from higher wireless exploration product sales.
The increase was also attributable to the increase from industrial product revenue and related gross profits.
Consolidated operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $10.8 million, an increase of $2.2 million, or 25.9%, from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
The increase was due to (i) a $2.4 million favorable non-cash adjustment reported in the prior year period resulting from a change in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to our Quantum and OptoSeis ® acquisitions, (ii) a $0.7 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, resulting from increased revenue and $0.3 million in employee termination costs and (iii) a $0.1 million increase in bad debt expense.
These increased operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in research and development project costs.
Consolidated other income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 did not change materially from the prior year period.

The increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in revenue and related gross profits.
The increase in operating income was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, mostly caused by higher research and development expense.
25
Emerging Markets
Revenue
Revenue from our Emerging Markets products was $0.1 million for each of the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
The revenue for each period primarily consisted of on-going service and maintenance related to our completed contract with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Operating Loss
Operating loss from our Emerging Markets products for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $(1.2) million, an increase of 0.4 million, or 47.9%, from the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year.
The increase in operating loss was primarily due to a $0.6 million favorable non-cash adjustment reported in the prior year period resulting from a change in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to our Quantum acquisition.
The increase in operating loss was partially offset by lower operating expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2022, we had approximately $12.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we used $4.9 million of cash from operating activities.
Our net loss of $0.1 million was offset by net non-cash charges of $6.4 million resulting from deferred income taxes, depreciation, amortization, accretion, inventory obsolescence, stock-based compensation and bad debt expense.
Other uses of cash in our operations primarily included (i) a $6.9 million increase in trade accounts and notes receivable primarily due to our increase in revenue and the timing of collections from customers, (ii) a $5.2 million increase in inventories to meet an increase in demand for our products and (iii) the removal of $3.1 million gross profit from the sale of used rental equipment as it is included in investing activities.
Offsetting these uses of cash were (i) a $1.9 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments to our suppliers, (ii) a $1.2 million increase in other liabilities due an increase in customer deposits we require for our rental equipment from and an increase in accrued property taxes and (iii) a $0.9 million decrease in other assets primarily due to a decrease in prepaid product purchases and prepaid insurance.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, we generated cash of $0.2 million in investing activities.
Sources of cash primarily consisted of proceeds of $0.6 million from the sale of used rental equipment.
Offsetting this source of cash were (i) $0.3 million for additions to our property, plant and equipment and (ii) $0.2 million for additions to our equipment rental fleet.
We expect our cash investments in our rental fleet to be approximately $6.0 million in fiscal year 2023.
We expect our cash investments in property, plant and equipment will be approximately $1.0 million in fiscal year 2023.
Our capital expenditures are expected to be funded from our cash on hand, internal cash flows, cash flows from our rental contracts or, if necessary, borrowings under our new credit agreement.
For the three months ended December 30, 2022, we used $0.2 million from financing activities for contingent consideration payments to the former shareholders of Quantum.
Our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $12.3 million at December 31, 2022, which included $2.9 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices, of which $2.2 million was held by our subsidiary in the Russian Federation.
In response to sanctions imposed by the U.S. and others on Russia, the Russian government has imposed restrictions on companies' abilities to repatriate or otherwise remit cash from their Russian-based operations to locations outside of Russia.
As a result, this cash can be used in our Russian operations, but we may be unable to transfer it out of Russia without incurring substantial costs, if at all.
In addition, if we were to repatriate the cash held by our Russian subsidiary, we would be required to accrue and pay taxes on any amount repatriated.
In May 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Agreement”) with Amerisource Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and as a lender, and Woodforest National Bank, as a lender.
Available borrowings under the Agreement are determined by a borrowing base with a maximum availability of $10 million.
The borrowing base is determined based upon certain of our domestic assets which include (i) 70% loan to value of our property located at 6410 Langfield Road in Houston, Texas (the “Property”), (ii) 50% of forced liquidation value of equipment, (iii) 80% of certain accounts receivable and (iv) 50% of forced liquidation value of certain inventory (inventory borrowing base limited to 100% of borrowing base credit given toward accounts receivable).
The Agreement is for a two-year term with all funds borrowed due at the expiration of the term.
The interest rate on borrowed funds is the Wall Street prime rate (with a minimum of 3.25%) plus 4.00%. We are required to make monthly interest payments on borrowed funds.
Borrowings under the Agreement will be principally secured by the Property and our domestic equipment, inventory and accounts receivables.
In addition, certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the Agreement and such subsidiaries have secured the obligations by pledging certain assets.
The Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of $100 million.
We expect to remain in compliance with this requirement in fiscal year 2023.
The Property is under contract to sell at December 31, 2022.
The Company is currently in discussions with its lenders to collateralize the Agreement with alternative domestic assets.
26
At December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding and were compliant with all covenants under the Agreement. Our borrowing availability at December 31, 2022 was $8.5 million.
We do not currently anticipate the need to borrow under the Agreement, however, we may decide to do so in the future, if needed.
Our available cash and cash equivalent and short-term investments decreased $4.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
In the absence of future profitable results of operations, we may need to rely on other sources of liquidity to fund our future operations, including executed rental contracts, available borrowings under our Agreement through its expiration in May 2024, leveraging or sales of real estate assets, sales of rental assets and other liquidity sources which may be available to us.
We currently believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to finance any future operating losses and planned capital expenditures through the next twelve months.
We do not have any obligations which meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement and which have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial statements or the items contained therein that are material to investors.
Contractual Obligations
Contingent Compensation Costs
In connection with the acquisition of Aquana in July 2021, we are subject to additional contingent cash payments to the former members of Aquana over a six-year earn-out period.
The contingent payments, if any, will be derived from certain eligible revenue generated during the earn-out period from products and services sold by Aquana. There is no maximum limit to the contingent cash payments that could be made.
The merger agreement with Aquana requires the continued employment of a certain key employee and former member of Aquana for the first four years of the six year earn-out period for any of Aquana’s former members to be eligible to any earn-out payments.

In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, as of December 31, 2022, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
