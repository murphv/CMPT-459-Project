NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
For the Six Months Ended November 30, 2022
Note 1 –
Organization and Description of
Business
PreAxia Health Care Payment Systems Inc. (the “Company”
or “PreAxia”) was incorporated on April 3, 2000 in the State of Nevada. On May 31, 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
stock of Tiempo de Mexico Ltd. (“Tiempo”) in exchange for
5,000,000
shares of the common stock of the Company with a par value
of $ 0.001 . The Company had no operations prior to the date of the aforementioned acquisition.
The business objective of the Company is the development,
distribution, marketing and sale of health care payment processing services and products. The Company has realized only nominal revenues
from its planned operations.
The operations of the Company are expected to be primarily
undertaken by its wholly-owned subsidiary, PreAxia Health Care Payment Ltd. (“PreAxia Payment”), incorporated pursuant to
the laws of the Province of Alberta on November 26, 2015.
PreAxia Payment is in the process of developing an
online access system creating a health spending account that will facilitate card payment and processing services to third-party administrators,
insurance companies and others.
Note 2 –
Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
Basis of presentation
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
of the Company for the three and six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on
Form 10-Q and Regulation S-K. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. However, such information reflects all adjustments (consisting
solely of normal recurring adjustments), which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial
position and the results of operations. Results shown for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained
for a full fiscal year. The balance sheet information as of May 31, 2022 was derived from the audited financial statements included in
the Company's financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 29, 2022. These financial statements should
be read in conjunction with that report.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (i) PreAxia Health Care Payment Systems Inc., incorporated pursuant to the
laws of the Province of Alberta on January 28, 2008 (ii) PreAxia Canada Inc., incorporated pursuant to the laws of the Province of Alberta
on January 28, 2008 and (iii) PreAxia Health Care Payment Ltd., incorporated pursuant to the laws of the Province of Alberta on November
26, 2015 (collectively, the “Subsidiaries”). All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Going Concern
The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the
realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the six months ended November 30,
2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $ 82,439
and used cash in operating activities of $ 24,011 ,
and on November 30, 2022, had a stockholders’ deficit of $ 2,222,903 .
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year of the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty should we be unable to
continue as a going concern.
F- 5
The Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon its ability to develop additional sources of capital and to ultimately achieve profitable operations. Currently,
the Company does not have significant cash or other material assets, nor does it have operations or a source of revenue sufficient to
cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company’s officers or principal shareholders have committed
to making advances or loans to pay for certain legal, accounting, and administrative costs.
The Company hopes to be able to attract suitable investors
for our business plan, which will not require us to use our cash. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in this
situation. The Company is unable to predict the effect, if any, that the COVID-19 global pandemic may have on its access to the financing
markets. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case
of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Company’s
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on management’s knowledge of current events and actions
that our company may undertake in the future, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company is the
United States dollar. The functional currency of the Subsidiaries is the Canadian dollar. Assets and liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and capital accounts
are translated at historical rates. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period.
Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in the accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) account in stockholders’ deficit.
Transactions undertaken in currencies other
than the functional currency of the entity are translated using the exchange rate in effect as of the transaction date. Any transaction
exchange gains and losses are included in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss.
The Company's reporting currency is the U.S.
dollar. All transactions initiated in Canadian Dollars are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
("ASC") 830-30, "Translation of Financial Statements," as follows:
i)       assets
and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet of
1.00
US Dollar = 1.3530
Canadian Dollars (November
30, 2022),
1.00
USD Dollar= 0.8363
GBP, and
1.00
US Dollar= 1.2632
Canadian Dollars (May 31, 2022),
1.00
USD Dollar= 0.7925
GBP;
ii)       income
and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the six months ended November 30, 2022 of
1.00
US Dollar =
1.3167
Canadian Dollars
and
1.00
US Dollar =
1.2452
Canadian Dollars (November 30, 2021);
iii)       all
resulting exchange differences are recognized as other comprehensive income, a separate component of equity. The exchange differences
during the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 were insignificant and no amounts have been recorded.
F- 6
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company defines fair value as the exchange
price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market
for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Management uses a fair value
hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent
sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the
best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
—
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
—
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
—
Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon
certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of November 30, 2022 and May 31, 2022. The carrying amounts
of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination
of these instruments and their expected realization.
Net Income (Loss) Per Share
Net income (loss) per share of common stock is computed
by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company has
10,587,600
shares
of potential common stock equivalents for convertible note payable – related party outstanding during the periods ended November
30, 2022 and 2021, which have been excluded from the loss per share computation as their effect would have been anti-dilutive due to net
losses.
Research and Development Costs
The Company expenses research and development
costs as incurred in accordance with FASB ASC 730 “Research and Development.” During the six months ended November 30, 2022
and 2021, we incurred $ 4,844
and $ 4,154 , respectively, in research and development expenses.
Software Development Costs
The Company accounts for software development
costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including FASB ASC 730, “Research and Development,” FASB ASC 350-40,
“Internal-Use Software,” FASB 985-20, “Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed” and FASB ASC
350-50, “Website Development Costs .”
Costs incurred during the period of planning
and design, prior to the period determining technological feasibility, for all software developed for use internal and external, has been
charged to operations in the period incurred as research and development costs.  Additionally, costs incurred after determination
of readiness for market have been expensed as research and development.
The Company will capitalize certain costs in
the development of our proprietary software (computer software to be sold, leased or licensed) for the period after technological feasibility
was determined and prior to our marketing and initial sales.
Website development costs are capitalized under
the same criteria as our marketed software.
F- 7
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
Long-lived assets such as property, equipment
and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable.  When required, impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset.  The
fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets, if available, or independent appraisals,
if required.  If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment
loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset.  When fair values are not available,
the Company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with
the recovery of the assets.  We did not recognize any impairment losses for any periods presented.
Commitments and Contingencies
The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies.  Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments,
litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
the assessment can be reasonably estimated.
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts
with Customers,” revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized
reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods or services. ASC 606 requires us to
apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3)
determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize
revenue when, or as, we satisfy the performance obligation.
Gross Versus Net Revenue
ASC 606 provides guidance on proper recognition of
principal versus agent considerations which is used to determine gross versus net revenue recognition. Under ASC 606, the core objective
of the guidance on gross versus net revenue recognition is to help determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a transaction.
In general, the primary difference between these two is the performance obligation being satisfied. The principal has a performance obligation
to provide the desired goods or services to the end customer, whereas the agent arranges for the principal to provide the desired goods
or services. Additionally, a fundamental characteristic of a principal in a transaction is control. A principal substantively controls
the goods and services before they are transferred to the customer as well as controls the price of the good or service being provided.
An agent normally receives a commission or fee for these activities. In addition to control, the level at which an entity controls the
price of the good or service being transferred determines principal versus agent status. The more discretion over setting price a company
has in providing the good or service, the more likely they are considered a principal rather than an agent. Under the guidance when another
party is involved in providing a good or service to a customer, an entity is a principal if the entity obtains control of the asset or
right to a service performed by the other party.
The Company provides administrative services for Health
Spending Accounts sponsored by employers (the “customer”). The Company does not take possession of goods or control the services
provided as the employees of customer are free to determine their health care provider. As such, the Company records revenue net of reimbursements
to employees. The Company’s services to the customer consist of reviewing medical costs for eligibility and reimbursing employees
for eligible costs.
During the three and six months ended November 30,
2022 and 2021, the Company had revenue of $ 0
and $ 230
and $ 0
and $ 271 , respectively. The Company earns a
10 % commission on amounts reimbursed
for eligible expenses.
F- 8
Income Taxes
The Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future
tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.  Under this method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income in the period that includes
the enactment date.
The Company follows section 740-10-25 of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification (“Section 740-10-25”) with regards to uncertain income tax positions.  Section 740-10-25
addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial
statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely
than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that
has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance
on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.

different from any future results, levels of activity or performance expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Such factors include, among others, the following:
international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; the ability of PreAxia to sustain, manage
or forecast its growth; the ability of PreAxia to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability;
new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or failure to comply with government regulations;

to reflect future events or developments, except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States.
All amounts stated herein are in US dollars unless
otherwise indicated.
The management’s discussion and analysis of
our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).  The following
discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial
statements for the year ended May 31, 2022, together with notes thereto.  As used in this quarterly report, the terms “we,”
“us,” “our,” “PreAxia” and the “Company” means PreAxia Health Care Payment Systems
Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless the context clearly requires otherwise.
General Overview
Corporate Overview
PreAxia Health Care Payment Systems Inc. (the
“Company” or “PreAxia”) was incorporated on April 3, 2000 in the State of Nevada.
The Company primarily undertakes its operations
through its wholly-owned subsidiary, PreAxia Health Care Payment Limited (“PreAxia Payment”). PreAxia Payment was incorporated
pursuant to the laws of the Province of Alberta on November 26, 2015.
5
General Overview
PreAxia Payment is a company which intends
to deliver a comprehensive suite of solutions and services directed at the emerging health payment market, specifically the opportunities
tied to the growth of health spending accounts (“HSA”). There is a rapid shift in healthcare traditional payment models to
consumer-directed healthcare that is creating significant opportunities for financial services and insurance industries to deliver new
dynamic products to this emerging market.
Spawned by the need to address escalating health
care costs, changes in the regulatory environment and the growing consumer desire for greater participation in the management of their
health benefits, the boundaries between health care and the financial services industries are becoming increasingly blurred. With the
trend towards self-directed health payment solutions and the growing demand for faster, easier and more convenient benefit services, the
insurance and benefits industries are banking on HSA medical payments being their next big growth conduit. Studies suggest that HSAs in
the US reached $112.4 billion in assets in 2022 and 33.4 million consumers in 2021, an increase of 11% of assets over the prior period.
The Canadian market for health benefits is estimated at more than $30 billion of which HSAs are estimated to have gain a 10% share. This,
coupled with the continued growth of the Canadian group insurance industry, illustrates the emerging opportunity for innovative health
payment services. We intend to initially launch our products in Canada. We believe that Canadian businesses are embracing a new healthcare
financing vehicle to provide greater value to employees, increase profitability and get more return from their investment. We intend to
provide them with services to capture this market opportunity.
Description of Health Spending Account (“HSA”)
An HSA is a uniquely designed account established
exclusively and specifically for the purpose of health care spending. An employer deposits funds into a special account for the employee.
These funds can be used to pay for eligible medical and related health care expenses for the employee and their dependents. HSAs provide
employers and employees with greater control in both the amount of funds invested and how these funds are used.
Services and infrastructure provided by PreAxia enable
organizations and individuals to eliminate all paper involved in the management of these accounts and benefit through savings in time
and money.
The PreAxia platform for processing and managing accounts,
including cardholder and customer account management, reconciliation and financial settlement, and customer reporting is fully operational.
Over time, the Company will evaluate opportunities
for forms of virtual banking and PayPal-type services. One opportunity seen as particularly relevant to the health care market is to offer
instant issuing services that enable corporations to issue and fund Pre-Paid Interac or credit card services to beneficiaries in real
time. If implemented, the beneficiary will most likely select a personal identification number (“PIN”) using a PIN and card
activation terminal, thus gaining instant access to funds that can be reloaded. This consideration would require development of software
systems for the issuing of health payment cards and financial transaction processing services that would be fully managed by a data center.
Matching of consumers in need of health care
products or services with providers is another area PreAxia intends to evaluate. Consumers managing their health care dollars through
an online system will find convenience in seeking out health care professionals and services through the same system .
Distribution Methods and Marketing Strategy
PreAxia operates on a Cloud Computing Platform
that makes it accessible to anyone with a personal computer and Internet access. The preliminary market for PreAxia’s HSA Management
Solution is small and medium sized companies that are not currently well served by the current group benefits model. The financial benefits
of the PreAxia business model, however, are also relevant to larger employers and we believe that these larger employers will migrate
to the PreAxia product over time.
6
PreAxia’s marketing strategy is to promote
its existing platform direct to consumers and businesses, and to the groups that most need access to it; independent brokers, financial
advisors and small to medium sized businesses. Brokers should see PreAxia as a superior method of promoting and supporting HSAs that allow
them to earn above average commission rates on invested funds. Financial advisors should see PreAxia in a similar way as brokers except
that there is the additional benefit of tax reduction. Small to medium sized businesses, which are expected to drive the growth in business,
should see PreAxia as offering financial savings to the company and to employees by offering personal health care benefits through an
HSA, along with the same conveniences they have come to expect from other services they currently utilize over the Internet. It is expected
that the group benefits market will subsequently follow as they too realize the advantages of PreAxia over their current HSA offerings.
PreAxia has begun and will continue to seek opportunities with lead customers and alliance partners to establish reference-able, high-profile
implementations and market-leading, early-adopter firms for further developing innovative products and services. The Company intends to
design solutions targeted towards corporate financial management, financial risk, audit management and cash management while targeting
product/service management as a support to financial management.
We anticipate that the prime target for services
will be small to medium sized organizations that are not adequately served by the current insurance and group benefits offerings. These
organizations should realize significant benefits in both cost and time savings by utilization of PreAxia technology while providing their
employees with an increased level of benefits.
PreAxia intends to achieve service volume and
the associated economies of scale through marketing directly to select target customers that provide the necessary transaction volumes,
through market specific channel partners and through an education based public relations strategy geared to the small to mid-sized employers
including the brokers and financial advisors utilized by these businesses. The channel strategy is supported in the solution design, as
multiple channel partners may require custom pricing and compensation.
It is our Company’s intention that brokers
and financial advisors will aggressively promote their PreAxia supported HSA offerings due to the quality of product, higher margins and
because of the non-competitive relationship with PreAxia.
PreAxia has identified the following “channels”
through which it will target prime end market customers:
·
Independent brokers that sell, or desire to sell, Health Spending Accounts
·
Financial advisors who manage funds and advise on tax saving strategies for individuals and corporations
·
Accountants and bookkeepers who regularly advise businesses on financial and operational matters
·
Benefits managers/adjudicators, including insurance, health or outsourced government benefits processors that manage benefits disbursement
·
Issuer banks, including partner banks that enable the issuance of Health Cards and/or sell insurance products
·
Application providers, including software manufacturers selling into the target vertical markets
·
Professional services, including consulting, development and implementation companies serving the target vertical markets
7
PreAxia intends to establish several key customer
reference accounts, channel marketing partners and technology alliances. These corporate relationships are relevant to advancing our company’s
goals in 2021 and beyond for achieving a prime position in the Canadian marketplace and establishing a solid service foundation.
Competitive Business Conditions and our Company’s
Competitive Position in the Industry and Methods of Competition
PreAxia intends to offer a combination of products
and services in its solution. However, there are other providers of components or versions of the Health Spending Accounts in the marketplace.
Our approach is to provide a high value added and robust capability within specific target markets, rather than the “one size fits
all” and mass volume approach of the larger companies in the Canadian and international market. This is consistent with the PreAxia
platform which has been designed for expansion in the United States and internationally. The following are some of the leading providers
of products and services that are or may be potential competitors in PreAxia’s target markets:
· Benecaid has become a leading provider of Health Spending Accounts in Canada by offering an easy to
understand product through brokers and also directly through the company.
· Olympia Benefits has become a leading provider of Health Spending Accounts in Canada by offering a “Cost
Plus” version of HSAs that has become popular in the marketplace.
· QuickCard is a provider of Health Spending Accounts and group insurance products. They are partially
differentiated from competitors by virtue of a “credit type card” that is used to pay for qualified health products and services.
·
League, which operates in Canada and the US, offers a range of health benefit services including
Health Spending Accounts.
· Most major insurance companies offer some version of HSAs to their customers.
· Many brokers have created HSA products for their clients.
· Many accounting and financial services firms have created their own HSA products to offer to their clients.
US and International Markets
· HealthEquity, a publicly listed company offering HSAs in the USA, manages over $15 billion in deposits.
It is one of the largest dedicated health account custodians in the USA and serves more than 12 million accounts owned by individuals
at more than 24,000 companies across the country.
· HSA Bank, a division of Webster Bank, offers Health Spending Accounts and related offerings to the consumer-directed
healthcare industry.
· Fidelity Investments offers a Health Spending Account to businesses as a means of controlling costs
while providing employee health benefits.
Intellectual Property and Patent Protection
At present, PreAxia does not have any pending or registered
patents or any trademarks.
Research and Development
For the six months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021,
we
incurred $4,844
and $ 4,154, respectively,
in research and development expenses.
8
Employees
PreAxia has one full-time consultant, our President,
Mr. Tom Zapatinas, effective September 1, 2011. We anticipate that we will hire additional key staff throughout 2023 in areas of administration/accounting,
business development, operations, sales/marketing and research/development.
Plan of Operation
Over the next twelve months, we plan to:
(a)
Raise additional capital to execute our business plans;
(b)
Penetrate the health care processing markets in Canada, the United States and worldwide, by continuing to develop innovative health care processing products and services;
(c)
Build up a network of strategic alliances with several types of health insurance companies, governments and other alliances in various vertical markets, and;
(d)
Fill the positions of senior management sales, administrative and engineering positions.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of November 30, 2022, PreAxia’s cash balance
was $175 compared to $259 as of May 31, 2022.  Our Company will be required to raise capital to fund our operations.  PreAxia
had a working capital deficit of $2,222,903 as of November 30, 2022 compared with a working capital deficit of $2,140,464 as of May 31,
2022.
Our ability to meet our financial liabilities and
commitments is primarily dependent upon the continued issuance of equity to new stockholders and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable
operations.  PreAxia's cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for the next
twelve-month period.   We will not initially have any cash flow from operating activities as we are in the startup stage.   We
project that we will require an estimated $2,800,000 over the next twelve-month period to fund our working capital deficit of approximately
$2,100,000 plus an additional $700,000 to complete our business plan. The Company plans to raise the capital required to satisfy
our immediate short-term needs and additional capital required to meet our estimated funding requirements for the next twelve months primarily
through the private placement of our equity securities or by way of loans or such other means as PreAxia may determine.
There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain
funds required for our continued operations.  There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when
needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.  If we are not able to obtain the additional
financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down
or perhaps even cease the operation of our business.
There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further long-term financing, successful and sufficient
market acceptance of our products and achieving a profitable level of operations.  The Company hopes to be able to attract suitable
investors for our business plan, which will not require us to use our cash. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful
in this situation. The Company is unable to predict the effect, if any, that the coronavirus COVID-19 global pandemic may have on its
access to the financing markets. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity
interests of our current stockholders.  Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our
liabilities and future cash commitments.
Our working capital (deficit) as of November 30, 2022
and May 31, 2022 is summarized as follows:

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

Critical Accounting Policies
We have identified certain accounting policies, described
below, that are the most important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations. Please refer to Note
2 of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for a full and complete disclosure of our accounting policies.
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts
with Customers,” revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized
reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods or services. ASC 606 requires us to
apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3)
determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize
revenue when, or as, we satisfy the performance obligation.
Gross Versus Net Revenue
ASC 606 provides guidance on proper recognition of
principal versus agent considerations which is used to determine gross versus net revenue recognition. Under ASC 606, the core objective
of the guidance on gross versus net revenue recognition is to help determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a transaction.
In general, the primary difference between these two is the performance obligation being satisfied. The principal has a performance obligation
to provide the desired goods or services to the end customer, whereas the agent arranges for the principal to provide the desired goods
or services. Additionally, a fundamental characteristic of a principal in a transaction is control. A principal substantively controls
the goods and services before they are transferred to the customer as well as controls the price of the good or service being provided.
An agent normally receives a commission or fee for these activities. In addition to control, the level at which an entity controls the
price of the good or service being transferred determines principal versus agent status. The more discretion over setting price a company
has in providing the good or service, the more likely they are considered a principal rather than an agent. Under the guidance when another
party is involved in providing a good or service to a customer, an entity is a principal if the entity obtains control of the asset or
right to a service performed by the other party.
The Company provides administrative services for Health
Spending Accounts sponsored by employers (the “customer”). The Company does not take possession of goods or control the services
provided as the employees of customer are free to determine their health care provider. As such, the Company records revenue net of reimbursements
to employees. The Company’s services to the customer consist of reviewing medical costs for eligibility and reimbursing employees
for eligible costs.
Software Development Costs
The Company accounts for software development costs
in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including FASB ASC 730, “Research and Development,” FASB ASC 350-40,
“Internal-Use Software,” FASB 985-20, “Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed” and FASB ASC
350-50, “Website Development Costs .”
Costs incurred during the period of planning and design,
prior to the period determining technological feasibility, for all software developed for use internal and external, has been charged
to operations in the period incurred as research and development costs.  Additionally, costs incurred after determination of readiness
for market have been expensed as research and development.
