Table of Contents EXPLANATORY NOTE This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2023 of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Ferrellgas, L.P., Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to “Ferrellgas Partners” refers to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. itself, without its consolidated subsidiaries. References to the “operating partnership” mean Ferrellgas, L.P., together (except where the context indicates otherwise) with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Ferrellgas Finance Corp. The terms “us,” “we,” “our,” “ours,” “consolidated,” the “Company” or “Ferrellgas” refer to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Ferrellgas, L.P., Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas Finance Corp., except when used in connection with “Class A Units” or “Class B Units,” in which case these terms refer to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. without its consolidated subsidiaries. Ferrellgas Partners is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed in 1994 and is primarily engaged in the retail distribution of propane and related equipment sales. Our Class A Units are traded on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol “FGPR.” The operating partnership was formed on April 22, 1994, and accounts for substantially all of our consolidated assets, sales and operating earnings. Ferrellgas Partners is a holding entity that conducts no operations and has two direct subsidiaries, the operating partnership and Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. Our activities are primarily conducted through the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners and the Preferred Unitholders are the only limited partners of the operating partnership. Ferrellgas, Inc. is the sole general partner of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership and, excluding the economic interests attributable to the Class B Units and the Preferred Units, owns an approximate 1% general partner economic interest in each, and, therefore, an effective 2% general partner economic interest in the operating partnership. Excluding the economic interests attributable to the Preferred Units, Ferrellgas Partners owns an approximate 99% limited partner interest in the operating partnership. Our general partner performs all management functions for us. The parent company of our general partner, Ferrell Companies, currently beneficially owns approximately 23.4% of our outstanding Class A Units. Ferrell Companies is owned 100% by an employee stock ownership trust. We believe that combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for these entities provides the following benefits: ● enhances investors’ understanding of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner that management views and operates the business; ● eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation, since a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership; and ● creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of a combined presentation. To help investors understand the differences between Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership, this report provides separate condensed consolidated financial statements for Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership. Noncontrolling interests, Class A Units, Class B Units, shareholders' equity (deficit) and partners' capital (deficit) are the main areas of difference between the condensed consolidated financial statements of Ferrellgas Partners and those of the operating partnership. A single set of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements is presented that includes separate discussions for Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership, when applicable. A combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section is also included that presents combined information and discrete information related to each entity, as applicable. In order to highlight the differences between Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership, this report includes the following sections that provide separate financial information for Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership: ● condensed consolidated financial statements; and ● certain accompanying notes to condensed consolidated financial statements, which denote “ Ferrellgas Partners ” and “ The operating partnership ” in sections where applicable. 2

Table of Contents FERRELLGAS PARTNERS, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES FERRELLGAS, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except per unit data, unless otherwise designated) (unaudited) A.    Partnership organization and formation Ferrellgas Partners Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. (“Ferrellgas Partners”) was formed on April 19, 1994, and is a publicly traded limited partnership. Ferrellgas Partners is a holding entity that conducts no operations and has
two
direct subsidiaries, Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas, L.P. (the “operating partnership”). Ferrellgas Partners was formed to acquire and hold a limited partner interest in the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners owns a
100 % equity interest in Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., whose only business activity is to act as the co-issuer and co-obligor of any debt securities issued by Ferrellgas Partners. Our activities are primarily conducted through the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership, collectively referred to as “Ferrellgas,” are both Delaware limited partnerships and are governed by their respective partnership agreements. These agreements contain specific provisions for the allocation of net earnings and loss to each of the partners for purposes of maintaining the partner capital accounts.
Ferrellgas, Inc. (the “general partner”), a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ferrell Companies, is the sole general partner of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership and, excluding the economic interests attributable to Ferrellgas Partners’ Class B Units and the operating partnership’s Preferred Units (as defined in Note F – Preferred units), owns an approximate
1 % general partner economic interest in each, and, therefore, an effective
2 % general partner economic interest in the operating partnership. Excluding the economic interests attributable to the Preferred Units, Ferrellgas Partners owns an approximate
99 % limited partner interest in the operating partnership. Our general partner performs all management functions for us. Unless contractually provided for, creditors of the operating partnership have no recourse with regards to Ferrellgas Partners. As of January 31, 2023, Ferrell Companies Inc., a Kansas corporation (“Ferrell Companies”), the parent company of our general partner, beneficially owns approximately
23.4 % of Ferrellgas Partners’ outstanding Class A Units. Ferrell Companies is owned
100 % by an employee stock ownership trust. The operating partnership The operating partnership was formed on April 22, 1994, and accounts for substantially all of our consolidated assets, sales and operating earnings. The operating partnership is a limited partnership that owns and operates propane distribution and related assets. Ferrellgas Partners and the holders of the Preferred Units are the only limited partners of the operating partnership. The operating partnership owns a
100 % equity interest in Ferrellgas Finance Corp., whose only business activity is to act as the co-issuer and co-obligor of debt securities issued by the operating partnership. The operating partnership is primarily engaged in the retail distribution of propane and related equipment sales. The propane distribution market is seasonal because propane is used primarily for heating in residential and commercial buildings. Ferrellgas serves residential, industrial/commercial, portable tank exchange, agricultural, wholesale and other customers in all
50
states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Basis of presentation Due to seasonality, the results of operations for the six months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending July 31, 2023. 14
Table of Contents The condensed consolidated financial statements of Ferrellgas reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods presented. All adjustments to the condensed consolidated financial statements were of a normal recurring nature. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with (i) the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and (ii) the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Ferrellgas’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022. B.    Summary of significant accounting policies (1) Accounting estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates impacting the condensed consolidated financial statements include accruals that have been established for contingent liabilities, pending claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of business, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, residual values of tanks, capitalization of customer tank installation costs, amortization methods of intangible assets, valuation methods used to value sales returns and allowances, allowance for expected credit losses, recoverability of long-lived assets, assumptions used to value business combinations, determination of incremental borrowing rate used to measure right-of-use asset and lease liability, and fair values of derivative contracts. (2) Goodwill, net Goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the second fiscal quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value. Ferrellgas has determined that it has
one
reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. Ferrellgas completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment test on January 31, 2023 and did not incur an impairment loss. (3) New accounting standards Recently adopted accounting pronouncements No new accounting standards were adopted during the six months ended January 31, 2023. Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted There were no recently issued accounting standards that could have a material impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or notes to condensed consolidated financial statements upon their adoption. ​ ​ ​ C.    Supplemental financial statement information Inventories Inventories consist of the following: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      January 31, 2023      July 31, 2022 Propane gas and related products ​ $

Table of Contents E.    Debt Short-term borrowing Ferrellgas classifies borrowings on its Senior secured revolving credit facility (as defined below) as short-term because they are primarily used to fund working capital needs that management intends to pay down within the twelve month period following the balance sheet date. As of January 31, 2023, we did
no t have any short-term borrowings. For further discussion, see the "Senior secured revolving credit facility" section below. Long-term debt Long-term debt consists of the following: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      January 31, 2023      July 31, 2022 Unsecured senior notes   ​      ​    Fixed rate,

1,450,016 ​ Senior secured revolving credit facility On March 30, 2021, the operating partnership, the general partner and certain of the operating partnership’s subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for a
four-year
revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 350.0
million. The Credit Agreement includes a sublimit not to exceed $ 200.0
million for the issuance of letters of credit. During the six months ended January 31, 2023, the operating partnership borrowed $ 45.0
million under the Credit Facility at a weighted-average interest rate of
6.875 % and repaid $ 45.0
million of these borrowings during the six months ended January 31, 2023. As of January 31, 2023, the operating partnership had
no
short-term borrowings. All borrowings under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by the general partner and the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the operating partnership (other than Ferrellgas Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas Receivables, LLC) and a limited-recourse guaranty from Ferrellgas Partners (limited to its equity interests in the operating partnership). Additionally, all borrowings are secured, on a first priority basis, by substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries and all of the equity interests in the operating partnership held by the general partner and Ferrellgas Partners. Availability under the Credit Facility is, at any time, an amount equal to (a) the lesser of the revolving commitment and the Borrowing Base (as defined below) minus (b) the sum of the aggregate outstanding amount of borrowings under the Credit Facility plus the undrawn amount of outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility plus unreimbursed drawings in respect of letters of credit (unless otherwise converted into revolving loans). The "Borrowing Base" equals the sum of: (a) $ 200.0
million, plus (b)
80 % of the eligible accounts receivable of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries, plus (c)
70 % of the eligible propane inventory of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries, valued at weighted average cost, less (d) certain reserves, as determined and subject to certain modifications by the administrative agent in its permitted discretion. 18
Table of Contents Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the operating partnership's option, at either (a) for base rate loans, (i) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (A) the rate of interest last quoted by
The Wall Street Journal
in the U.S. as the prime rate in effect, (B) the NYFRB Rate from time to time plus
0.50 % per annum and (C) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one-month interest period plus
1.00 % per annum plus (ii) a margin of
1.50 % to
2.00 % per annum depending on total net leverage or (b) for Eurodollar rate loans, (i) a rate determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus (ii) a margin of
2.50 % to
3.00 % per annum depending on total net leverage. The operating partnership will be required to pay an undrawn fee to the lenders on the average daily unused amount of the Credit Facility at a rate of
0.375 % to
0.50 % per annum depending on total net leverage. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default and requires the operating partnership to maintain the following financial covenants: ​ ​ ​ ​ Financial Covenant ​ Ratio Minimum interest coverage ratio
(1) ​ 2.50 x Maximum secured leverage ratio
(2) ​ 2.50 x Maximum total net leverage ratio
(3) (4) ​ 5.00 x (1) Defined generally as the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to cash interest expense. (2) Defined generally as the ratio of total first priority secured indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA. (3) Defined generally as the ratio of total indebtedness (net of unrestricted cash, subject to certain limits) to adjusted EBITDA.
(4) Was
5.25 x immediately prior to the quarter ended October 31, 2022 and will be
4.75 x beginning with the quarter ended April 30, 2023. In addition to the financial covenants, the Credit Agreement includes covenants that may (or if not met will) restrict the ability of the operating partnership to take certain actions. In particular, under these covenants, subject to certain exceptions and additional requirements, the operating partnership is permitted to make cash distributions to holders of Preferred Units, Ferrellgas Partners and the general partner, redemptions of Preferred Units and other restricted payments (i) only in limited amounts specified in the Credit Agreement and (ii) only if availability under the Credit Facility exceeds the greater of $ 50.0
million and
15 % of the Borrowing Base and the operating partnership’s total net leverage ratio is not greater than
5.0
to 1.0 (or
4.75
to 1.0 starting on April 30, 2023). As of January 31, 2023, the operating partnership is in compliance with all of its debt covenants. Senior unsecured notes On March 30, 2021, $ 650.0
million aggregate principal amount of
5.375 % senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and $ 825.0
million aggregate principal amount of
5.875 % senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) were issued. The 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes are the senior unsecured obligations of the operating partnership and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. and are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by the general partner and all domestic subsidiaries of the operating partnership other than Ferrellgas Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas Receivables, LLC. The 2026 Notes may be redeemed prior to April 1, 2023 and the 2029 Notes may be redeemed prior to April 1, 2024 at the issuers’ option, in whole or in part, at a redemption price of par plus the applicable make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest. On and after April 1, 2023 and April 1, 2024, the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes, respectively, may be redeemed at the issuers’ option, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the respective indenture governing such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Beginning on April 1, 2025 and April 1, 2026, the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes, respectively, may be redeemed at par plus accrued and unpaid interest. 19
Table of Contents The indentures governing the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of the operating partnership and its restricted subsidiaries to take certain actions. In particular, under these covenants, subject to certain exceptions and additional requirements, the operating partnership is permitted to make cash distributions to holders of Preferred Units, Ferrellgas Partners and the general partner, redemptions of Preferred Units and other restricted payments (i) only in limited amounts specified in the indentures and (ii) only if the operating partnership’s net leverage ratio (defined generally to mean the ratio of consolidated total net debt to trailing
four
quarters consolidated EBITDA, both as adjusted for certain, specified items) is not greater than
5.0
to 1.0, on a pro forma basis giving effect to the restricted payment and, if applicable, certain other specified events. Further, if the operating partnership’s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (defined generally to mean the ratio of trailing
four
quarters consolidated EBITDA to consolidated fixed charges, both as adjusted for certain, specified items) is equal to or less than
1.75
to 1.00 (on a pro forma basis giving effect to the restricted payment and, if applicable, certain other specified events), the amount of distributions and other restricted payments the operating partnership is permitted to make under the indentures is further limited. As of January 31, 2023, the operating partnership is in compliance with all of its debt covenants. The scheduled annual principal payments on long-term debt are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Scheduled Payment due by fiscal year      principal payments 2023 ​ $

825,410 Total ​ $
1,482,406 ​ Letters of credit outstanding at January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 totaled $ 76.5
million and $ 87.6
million, respectively, and were used to secure insurance arrangements, product purchases and commodity hedges. As of January 31, 2023, Ferrellgas had available borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility of $ 273.5
million.
F.    Preferred units On March 30, 2021, pursuant to an Investment Agreement, the operating partnership issued an aggregate of
700,000
Preferred Units (the “Preferred Units”), having an aggregate initial liquidation preference of $ 700.0
million.
Redemption of the Preferred Units in the near term is not probable because of the high redemption price in the first three to four years. As described in greater detail under “Issuer Redemption Right” below, the Redemption Price for the Preferred Units is based upon the greater of the amount that would result in a
1.47 x MOIC (defined below) and the amount that would result in a
12.25 % internal rate of return. If the Preferred Units were redeemed during the first three to four years after issuance, the
1.47 x MOIC would require a large premium payment and that large premium payment would result in an internal rate of return far in excess of the minimum
12.25 %. Consequently, it is unlikely that Ferrellgas would be able to achieve any savings in its cost of capital by redeeming the Preferred Units during the first three to four years after issuance. “ MOIC ” means, with respect to a Preferred Unit, a multiple on invested capital equal to the quotient determined by dividing (A) the sum of (x) the aggregate amount of all distributions made in cash with respect to such Preferred Unit prior to the applicable date of determination, with certain exclusions, plus (y) each Redemption Price paid in cash in respect of such Preferred Unit, on or prior to the applicable date of determination, by (B) the Purchase Price (defined below) of such Preferred Unit. The preferences, rights, privileges and other terms of the Preferred Units are set forth in the First Amendment to the Amended OpCo LPA (the “OpCo LPA Amendment”) entered into by the general partner on March 30, 2021 (along with the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Ferrellgas, L.P. (the “Amended OpCo LPA”)) and are described below. 20
Table of Contents Issuer Redemption Right The operating partnership has the right to redeem all or a portion of the Preferred Units for cash, pro rata and at any time and from time to time, including in connection with a Change of Control (as defined in the OpCo LPA Amendment), at an amount per Preferred Unit (the “Redemption Price”) equal to, without duplication, the sum of (a) the greater of (i) the amount necessary to result in a MOIC of
1.47 x in respect of the purchase price, before discount, of such Preferred Unit, which is $ 1,000
per Preferred Unit (the “Purchase Price”), and (ii) the amount necessary to result in the applicable internal rate of return equal to
12.25 %, which is increased by
150
basis points if the operating partnership has elected to pay more than four Quarterly Distributions (as defined below) in PIK Units (as defined below) and (b) the accumulated but unpaid Quarterly Distributions to the date of redemption, if any. A partial redemption of the Preferred Units is permitted only in the event the aggregate amount to be paid in respect of all Preferred Units included in such partial redemption is at least $ 25.0
million. Investor Redemption Right In the event that (i) any Class B Units are outstanding, or (ii) (x)
no
Class B Units are outstanding and (y) no more than
233,300
Preferred Units are outstanding, at any time on and after March 30, 2031, the Required Holders may elect, by delivery of written notice, to have the operating partnership fully redeem each remaining outstanding Preferred Unit for an amount in cash equal to the Redemption Price. “Required Holders” refers to both (i) holders owning at least
33.3 % of the total Preferred Units outstanding at any time and (ii) certain initial affiliated purchasers, for so long as such initial affiliated purchasers collectively own at least
25 % of the Preferred Units outstanding at such time. In the event that (i)
no
Class B Units are outstanding and (ii) more than
233,300
Preferred Units are outstanding, the Required Holders will have the right to trigger a sale of the operating partnership after March 30, 2031. If the operating partnership fails to consummate a sale that would pay the Redemption Price in full within
180
days of written notice requiring such sale, the Required Holders will have the right to appoint a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the general partner and initiate a sale of the operating partnership. Change of Control Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the OpCo LPA Amendment), the Required Holders will have the option to require the redemption of all or a portion of the Preferred Units in cash in an amount equal to the Redemption Price; provided, that such Redemption Price shall not be payable unless the operating partnership shall have first made any required change of control offer pursuant to the indentures governing the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes and purchased all such 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes tendered pursuant to such offer (unless otherwise waived by such noteholders); provided, further that the Redemption Price shall be paid immediately following the purchase of such tendered Notes (if any). Fair Value of Embedded Derivatives Fe rrellgas identified the investor redemption right and the change in control option as
embedded derivatives that require bifurcation as they are
not clearly and closely related to the debt host contract and
has concluded that the fair values at issuance and at January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, are immaterial to the financial statements. Distributions Pursuant to the OpCo LPA Amendment, the operating partnership is required to pay to the holders of each Preferred Unit a cumulative, quarterly distribution (the "Quarterly Distribution") at the Distribution Rate (as defined below) on the Purchase Price. "Distribution Rate" means, for the first five years after March 30, 2021, a rate per annum equal to
8.956 % , with certain increases in the Distribution Rate on each of the 5 th , 6 th  and 7 th  anniversaries of March 30, 2021, subject to a maximum rate of
11.125 %
and certain other adjustments and exceptions. The Quarterly Distribution may be paid in cash or, at the election of the operating partnership, "in kind" through the issuance of additional Preferred Units ("PIK Units") at the quarterly Distribution Rate plus an applicable premium that escalates each year from
75
bps to
300
bps so long as the Preferred Units remain outstanding. In the event the operating partnership fails to make any Quarterly Distribution in cash, such Quarterly Distribution will automatically be paid in PIK Units. 21
Table of Contents The Distribution Rate on the Preferred Units will increase upon violation of certain protective provisions for the benefit of Preferred Unit holders notwithstanding the cap mentioned above. As of January 31, 2023, the Quarterly Distribution accrued was $ 18.6
million. On February 15, 2023, $ 15.4
million of the Quarterly Distribution was paid in cash to holders of Preferred Units. The remaining Quarterly Distribution accrual of $ 3.2
million represents Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units pursuant to the side letters outlined in the OpCo LPA Amendment. As of January 31, 2022, the Quarterly Distribution accrued was $ 17.7
million. On February 15, 2022, $ 15.4
million of the Quarterly Distribution was paid in cash to holders of the Preferred Units. The remaining Quarterly Distribution accrued of $ 2.3
million represented Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units pursuant to the side letters. Tax Distributions For any quarter in which the operating partnership makes a Quarterly Distribution in PIK Units in lieu of cash, it will be required to make a subsequent cash tax distribution for such quarter in an amount equal to the (i) the lesser of (x)
25 % and (y) the highest combined federal, state and local tax rate applicable for corporations organized in New York, multiplied by (ii) the excess (if any) of (A)
one-fourth
(1/4th) of the estimated taxable income to be allocated to the holders of Preferred Units for the year in which the Quarterly Tax Payment Date (which refers to certain specified dates that next follow a Quarterly Distribution date on which PIK Units were issued) occurs, over (B) any cash paid on the Quarterly Distribution date immediately preceding the Quarterly Tax Payment Date on which a quarterly tax amount would otherwise be paid (such amount, the "Tax Distribution"). Tax Distributions are treated as advances against, and reduce, future cash distributions for any reason, including payments in redemption of Preferred Units or PIK Units, or payments to the holders in their capacity as such pursuant to any side letter or other agreement. Additional Amounts for Certain Purchasers The operating partnership is required to pay certain additional amounts of cash (the “Additional Amounts”) as necessary to certain holders of Preferred Units that hold their interests through a “blocker,” which is a U.S. entity that is owned and organized by certain original purchasers of Preferred Units who are non-U.S. persons or tax exempt for U.S. tax purposes and is treated as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes. Only certain original purchasers of Preferred Units who hold their Preferred Units through such blockers are, and none of their transferees is, entitled to Additional Amounts. Additional Amounts are capped at the lesser of: (a) the product of
20 % multiplied by taxable income allocated to a “blocker” (as defined) divided by
0.8 , and (b) the actual taxes payable by the “blocker” as a result of holding Senior Preferred Units.
Board Rights For so long as at least
140,000
Preferred Units remain outstanding, holders of the Preferred Units have the right to designate
one
director to the Board of the general partner, subject to approval by the general partner. Protective Provisions The OpCo LPA Amendment and the Sixth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. (the “Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA”) include, among other things, certain covenants for the benefit of holders of Preferred Units applicable to the operating partnership and, in certain instances, Ferrellgas Partners, for so long as at least $ 35,000,000
of Preferred Units and PIK Units remain outstanding. These covenants include, among other things, limitations on (i) effecting a Change of Control, (ii) amending organizational documents, (iii) issuing certain equity securities, (iv) issuing Preferred Units, (v) filing for bankruptcy, (vi) non-ordinary course investments, and (vii) incurring certain levels of indebtedness. Ranking and Liquidation Preference The Preferred Units rank senior to any other class or series of equity interests of the operating partnership (including the partnership interests held by Ferrellgas Partners and the general partner). Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the operating partnership, each holder of Preferred Units will be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any assets of the operating partnership to the holders of any other class or series of equity interests in the operating partnership (including Ferrellgas Partners and the general partner), an amount per Preferred Unit equal to the Redemption Price. 22
Table of Contents Restrictions on Cash Distributions to Ferrellgas Partners and the General Partner The operating partnership is permitted to make distributions of Available Cash (as defined in the Amended OpCo LPA) to Ferrellgas Partners only if (i) the operating partnership has made all required Quarterly Distributions (in cash or PIK Units), Tax Distributions and payments of Additional Amounts, (ii) the operating partnership has redeemed all PIK Units issued, (iii) the operating partnership’s consolidated net leverage (defined generally to mean the ratio of the operating partnership’s consolidated total net debt (including the total redemption price of all outstanding Preferred Units and PIK Units but excluding certain letters of credit and capital lease obligations) as of each Quarterly Distribution Date to trailing four quarters consolidated EBITDA, both as adjusted for certain, specified items) is below
7.25 x through May 15, 2022 and
7.00 x thereafter, net of cash, immediately before and after giving effect to such distribution, (iv) the operating partnership has at least $ 100
million of liquidity, consisting of unrestricted cash on hand and available capacity under the Credit Agreement or any replacement thereof, and (v) the operating partnership is in compliance with the other protective provisions in the OpCo LPA Amendment. G.    Equity (Deficit) Ferrellgas Partners Class B Units On March 30, 2021, Ferrellgas Partners issued
1.3
million Class B Units to the holders of the $ 357.0
million aggregate principal amount of its
8.625 % senior unsecured notes due June 2020 (the “Ferrellgas Partners Notes”) in exchange for such holders’ contribution of the Ferrellgas Partners Notes to Ferrellgas Partners as a capital contribution and in satisfaction of such holders’ claims in respect of the Ferrellgas Partners Notes. The terms of the Class B Units are set forth in the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA entered into by the general partner on March 30, 2021.
Ferrellgas Partners may, subject to certain conditions, issue additional Class A Units to such parties as determined at the discretion of Ferrellgas Partners, upon consent by the holders of the requisite percentage of Class B Units as specified in the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA (the “Requisite Class B Units”), which refers to: (i) if the initial majority holder of Class B Units holds at least
50 % of Class B Units, holders of at least
50 % of the outstanding Class B Units, or (ii) if the initial majority holder of Class B Units holds less than
50 % of Class B Units, holders of at least
one-third
of the outstanding Class B Units. Pursuant to the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA, while any Class B Units remain outstanding, any distributions by Ferrellgas Partners to its partners must be made such that the ratio of (i) the amount of distributions made to holders of Class B Units to (ii) the amount of distributions made to holders of Class A Units and the general partner is not less than
6 :1. Once holders of Class B Units receive distributions in the aggregate amount of $ 357.0
million (which was the outstanding principal amount of the Ferrellgas Partners Notes), the Class B Units will be (i) convertible into Class A Units at the option of Ferrellgas Partners, if that distribution threshold is reached prior to March 30, 2026, the fifth anniversary post-emergence, or (ii) converted automatically into Class A Units, if the distribution threshold is reached on or after March 30, 2026, in each case at the applicable conversion rate set forth in the following table: ​ ​ ​ Period Conversion Factor Through March 30, 2023 2.00 x March 31, 2023 through March 30, 2024 3.50 x March 31, 2024 through March 30, 2025 4.00 x March 31, 2025 through March 30, 2026 5.00 x March 31, 2026 through March 30, 2027 6.00 x March 31, 2027 through March 30, 2028 7.00 x March 31, 2028 through March 30, 2029 10.00 x March 31, 2029 through March 30, 2030 12.00 x March 31, 2030 through March 30, 2031 25.00 x 23
Table of Contents ​ Ferrellgas Partners may redeem the Class B Units through March 30, 2026, in full, at a price equal to an amount that will result in an internal rate of return with respect to the Class B Units equal to the sum of (i)
300
basis points and (ii) the internal rate of return for the Preferred Units as specified in the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA, subject to the minimum redemption price of $ 302.08
per unit. The total internal rate of return required to redeem the Class B Units is
15.85 %, but that amount increases under certain circumstances, including if the operating partnership paid distributions on the Preferred Units in-kind rather than in cash for a certain number of quarters. There have not been any in-kind distributions through January 31, 2023. During the period through March 30, 2026, after Ferrellgas Partners has distributed $ 356
million in distributions to holders of the Class B Units, Ferrellgas Partners will have the option to hold cash for
six months
at either Ferrellgas Partners or Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. for the sole purpose of redeeming the Class B Units. However, if the funds held are not used to redeem the Class B Units, the funds must either be distributed to holders of the Class B Units and, if applicable, holders of the Class A Units and the general partner or returned to the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners will only be able to redeem the Class B Units to the extent it receives sufficient distributions from the operating partnership, and the operating partnership is limited in its ability to make distributions by the indentures that govern the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes, the Credit Agreement and the OpCo LPA Amendment governing the Preferred Units. The holders of the Class B Units will have the right to acquire the general partner interests in Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership, without the approval of the general partner, Ferrellgas Partners, the holders of the Class A Units or the operating partnership, if the Class B Units are still outstanding and have not been converted to Class A Units by the earlier of (i) a material breach of the covenants in favor of the Class B Units under the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA or the Amended OpCo LPA that is not cured within the time period specified therein and (ii) March 30, 2031. Board Rights The holders of Class B Units will be permitted to designate
one
independent director to the Board of the general partner in accordance with a voting agreement among the general partner, Ferrell Companies, Inc. ("FCI"), the sole stockholder of the general partner, and the holders of the Class B Units and the general partner's bylaws. Class A Units As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, Class A Units were beneficially owned by the following: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      January 31, 2023      July 31, 2022 Public Class A Unitholders

The following table presents retail propane revenues, wholesale propane revenues and other revenues.

1,079,442 ​ ​ Contract assets and liabilities Ferrellgas’ performance obligations are generally limited to the delivery of propane for its retail and wholesale contracts. Ferrellgas’ performance obligations with respect to sales of appliances and other materials and other revenues are limited to the delivery of the agreed upon good or service. Ferrellgas does not have material performance obligations that are delivered over time, thus all of its revenue is recognized at the time the goods, including propane, are delivered or installed. Ferrellgas offers “even pay” and other billing programs that can create customer deposits or advances, depending on whether Ferrellgas has delivered more propane than the customer has paid for or whether the customer has paid for more propane than what has been delivered. Revenue is recognized from these customer deposits or advances to customers at the time product is delivered. The advance or deposit is considered to be a contract asset or liability. Additionally, from time to time, we have customers that pay in advance for goods or services, and such amounts result in contract liabilities. Ferrellgas incurs incremental commissions directly related to the acquisition or renewal of customer contracts. The commissions are calculated and paid based upon the number of gallons sold to the acquired or renewed customer. The total amount of commissions that we incur is not material, and the commissions are expensed commensurate with the deliveries to which they relate; therefore, we do not capitalize these costs. The following table presents the opening and closing balances of our contract assets and contract liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

Table of Contents Remaining performance obligations Ferrellgas’ remaining performance obligations are generally limited to situations where customers have remitted payment but have not yet received deliveries of propane. This most commonly occurs in even pay billing programs and Ferrellgas expects that these balances will be recognized within a  year
or less as the customer takes delivery of propane. I.    Fair value measurements Derivative financial instruments The following table presents Ferrellgas’ financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis for each of the fair value hierarchy levels, including both current and noncurrent portions, as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Asset (Liability) ​ ​ Quoted Prices in Active      ​ ​      ​ ​      ​ ​ ​ ​ Markets for Identical ​ Significant Other ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Assets and Liabilities ​ Observable Inputs ​ Unobservable Inputs ​ ​ ​ ​      (Level 1)      (Level 2)      (Level 3)      Total January 31, 2023:   ​      ​      ​      ​    Assets:   ​      ​      ​      ​    Derivative financial instruments:   ​      ​      ​      ​    Commodity derivatives ​ $

( 12,960 ) ​ Methodology The fair values of Ferrellgas’ non-exchange traded commodity derivative contracts are based upon indicative price quotations available through brokers, industry price publications or recent market transactions and related market indicators. There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the six months ended January 31, 2023 and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. Other financial instruments The carrying amounts of other financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities (except for current maturities of long-term debt) approximate their fair values because of their short-term nature. At January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of Ferrellgas’ long-term debt instruments was $ 1,283.2
million and $ 1,327.8
million, respectively. Ferrellgas estimates the fair value of long-term debt based on quoted market prices. The fair value of Ferrellgas’ consolidated debt obligations is a Level 2 valuation based on the observable inputs used for similar liabilities. Ferrellgas has other financial instruments such as trade accounts receivable which could expose it to concentrations of credit risk. The credit risk from trade accounts receivable is limited because of a large customer base which extends across many different U.S. markets. 27
Table of Contents J.    Derivative instruments and hedging activities Ferrellgas is exposed to certain market risks related to its ongoing business operations. These risks include exposure to changing commodity prices as well as fluctuations in interest rates. Ferrellgas utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. Of these, the propane commodity derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. Derivative instruments and hedging activity During the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, Ferrellgas did
not
recognize any
gain
or loss in earnings related to hedge ineffectiveness and did not exclude any component of financial derivative contract gains or losses from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to commodity cash flow hedges.

Table of Contents Ferrellgas’ exchange traded commodity derivative contracts require a cash margin deposit as collateral for contracts that are in a negative mark-to-market position. These cash margin deposits will be returned if mark-to-market conditions improve or will be applied against cash settlement when the contracts are settled.

92,038 ​ Ferrellgas expects to reclassify net losses of approximately $ 10.2
million to earnings during the next 12 months. These net losses are expected to be offset by increased margins on propane sales commitments Ferrellgas has with its customers that qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception. During the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, Ferrellgas had
no
reclassifications to operations resulting from the discontinuance of any cash flow hedges arising from the probability of the original forecasted transactions not occurring within the originally specified period of time defined within the hedging relationship. As of January 31, 2023, Ferrellgas had financial derivative contracts covering
2.2
million barrels of propane that were entered into as cash flow hedges of forward and forecasted purchases of propane. Derivative financial instruments credit risk Ferrellgas is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial and commodity instruments. Ferrellgas’ counterparties principally consist of major energy companies and major U.S. financial institutions. Ferrellgas maintains credit policies with regard to its counterparties that it believes reduces its overall credit risk. These policies include evaluating and monitoring its counterparties’ financial condition, including their credit ratings, and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit limits. Certain of these agreements call for the posting of collateral by the counterparty or by Ferrellgas in the forms of letters of credit, parent guarantees or cash. Ferrellgas has concentrations of credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments held by certain derivative financial instrument counterparties. If these counterparties that make up the concentration failed to perform according to the terms of their contracts at January 31, 2023, the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk that Ferrellgas would incur based upon the gross fair values of the derivative financial instruments is
zero . From time to time Ferrellgas enters into derivative contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features which dictate credit limits based upon Ferrellgas’ debt rating. There were
no
open derivative contracts with credit-risk-related contingent features as of January 31, 2023. 30
Table of Contents K.    Transactions with related parties Ferrellgas has
no
employees and is managed and controlled by its general partner. Pursuant to Ferrellgas’ partnership agreements, the general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on behalf of Ferrellgas and all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to Ferrellgas or otherwise reasonably incurred by its general partner in connection with operating Ferrellgas’ business. These costs primarily include compensation and benefits paid to employees of the general partner who perform services on Ferrellgas’ behalf and are reported in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ For the three months ended January 31,  ​ For the six months ended January 31,  ​      2023      2022      2023      2022 Operating expense ​ $

L .    Contingencies and commitments Litigation Ferrellgas’ operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling, storing, transporting and otherwise providing for use by consumers of combustible liquids such as propane and, prior to the sales of midstream operations in fiscal 2018, crude oil. As a result, at any given time, we can be threatened with or named as a defendant in various lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. Other than as discussed below, we are not a party to any legal proceedings other than various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. It is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of these matters; however, management is of the opinion that there are no known claims or contingent claims that are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Ferrellgas and Bridger Logistics, LLC (“Bridger”), have been named, along with
two
former officers (“Rios and Gamboa”), in a lawsuit (the “EDPA Lawsuit”) filed by Eddystone Rail Company ("Eddystone") on February 2, 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the "Court"). On December 10, 2021, the Court dismissed Eddystone’s claims against Rios and Gamboa, pursuant to a settlement agreement with Eddystone. Eddystone indicated that it has prevailed in or settled an arbitration against Jamex Transfer Services (“JTS”), previously named Bridger Transfer Services, a former subsidiary of Bridger. The arbitration involved a claim against JTS for money due for deficiency payments under a contract for the use of an Eddystone facility used to offload crude from rail onto barges. Eddystone alleges that Ferrellgas transferred assets out of JTS prior to the sale of the membership interest in JTS to Jamex Transfer Holdings, and that those transfers should be avoided so that the assets can be used to satisfy the amount owed by JTS to Eddystone as a result of the arbitration. Eddystone also alleges that JTS was an “alter ego” of Bridger and Ferrellgas and that Bridger and Ferrellgas breached both an implicit contract as well as fiduciary duties allegedly owed to Eddystone as a creditor of JTS. Ferrellgas believes that Ferrellgas and Bridger have valid defenses to these claims and to Eddystone’s primary claim against JTS for breach of contract. If Eddystone ultimately prevails, however, Ferrellgas believes that the amount of damages awarded could be material to Ferrellgas. Ferrellgas intends to vigorously defend this claim.
The Court decided summary judgment motions in March 2022 and the three segments of the bench trial were completed in September 2022, December 2022 and February 2023, respectively. The Court set a briefing schedule through May 2023, and closing arguments for August 2023. Management does not currently believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time. However, we may enter into settlement discussions at any time. Long-term debt related commitments Ferrellgas has long and short-term payment obligations under agreements such as the indentures governing its senior notes. See Note E – Debt for a description of these debt obligations and a schedule of future maturities. ​ 31

100 % to the Class B Units until the allocation equals the cumulative amount of all distributions paid to the Class B Units. Any remaining undistributed net earnings will be allocated between the Class B Units and the Class A Units on a
six -to-one basis as if all undistributed earnings had been distributed to each class of units in accordance with their distribution rights. For any periods in which losses are recognized, no effect is given to the Class B Units as they do not contractually participate in the losses of Ferrellgas. In addition, Ferrellgas has the option to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Class B Units outstanding at any time on or prior to March 30, 2026 for cash. This call option does not impact the dilutive effect of net loss per Class A Unit due to the cash-only redemption provision, which is assumed, and therefore there would be no dilutive effect. N.    Subsequent events Ferrellgas has evaluated events and transactions occurring after the balance sheet date through the date Ferrellgas’ condensed consolidated financial statements were issued and concluded that there were
no
events or transactions occurring during this period that required recognition or disclosure in its condensed consolidated financial statements. 32

When considering any forward-looking statement, you should also keep in mind the risk factors set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022 and in any more recent filings with the SEC. Any of these risks could impair our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any such impairment may affect our ability to make distributions to our unitholders or pay interest on the principal of any of our debt securities. In addition, the trading price of our securities could decline as a result of any such impairment. Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information as required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or risk factors after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Overview Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners is a holding entity that conducts no operations and has two direct subsidiaries, the operating partnership and Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. Our activities are primarily conducted through the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners and the Preferred Unitholders are the only limited partners of the operating partnership. Ferrellgas, Inc. is the sole general partner of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership and, excluding the economic interests attributable to the Class B Units and the Preferred Units, owns an approximate 1% general partner economic interest in each, and, therefore, an effective 2% general partner economic interest in the operating partnership. Excluding the economic interests attributable to the Preferred Units, Ferrellgas Partners owns an approximate 99% limited partner interest in the operating partnership. For information regarding the economic and other terms of the Class B Units and the Preferred Units, see Note G – Equity (Deficit) and Note F – Preferred units to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.
42
Table of Contents Our general partner performs all management functions for us. The parent company of our general partner, Ferrell Companies, currently beneficially owns approximately 23.4% of our outstanding Class A units. Ferrell Companies is owned 100% by an employee stock ownership trust. The operating partnership was formed on April 22, 1994, and accounts for substantially all of our consolidated assets, sales and operating earnings. Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. have nominal assets, do not conduct any operations and have no employees other than officers. Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. has served as co-issuer and co-obligor for debt securities of Ferrellgas Partners, while Ferrellgas Finance Corp., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, serves as co-issuer and co-obligor for debt securities of the operating partnership. Accordingly, and due to the reduced disclosure format, a discussion of the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources of Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. is not presented in this section. The Class A Units of Ferrellgas Partners are traded on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol “FGPR”. We file annual, quarterly, and current reports and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). You may read and download our SEC filings over the Internet from several commercial document retrieval services as well as at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Our SEC filings are also available on our website at www.ferrellgas.com at no cost as soon as reasonably practicable after our electronic filing or furnishing thereof with the SEC. Please note that any Internet addresses provided in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are for informational purposes only and are not intended to be hyperlinks. Accordingly, no information found and/or provided at such Internet addresses is intended or deemed to be incorporated by reference herein. The following is a discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022 and in our unaudited historical condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The discussions set forth in the “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections generally refer to Ferrellgas Partners and its consolidated subsidiaries.
COVID-19 developments COVID-19, and variants thereof, continues to evolve and impact the economy of the United States and other countries around the world. While the majority of areas in the United States have reduced most or all COVID-19 restrictions, there remains uncertainty as to the magnitude and duration COVID-19 could have on our operations and sales. We will continue to monitor the situation and adapt to changing circumstances as needed for our business.   How We Evaluate Our Operations We evaluate our overall business performance based primarily on a metric we refer to as “Adjusted EBITDA,” which is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. We do not utilize depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in our key measures because we focus our performance management on cash flow generation and our revenue generating assets have long useful lives. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net earnings attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see the subheading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Propane operations and related equipment sales Based on our propane sales volumes in fiscal 2022, we believe that we are the second largest retail marketer of propane in the United States and a leading national provider of propane by portable tank exchange. We serve residential, industrial/commercial, portable tank exchange, agricultural, wholesale and other customers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our operations primarily include the retail distribution and sale of propane and related equipment and supplies with concentrations in the Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and Northwest regions of the United States. 43
Table of Contents We use information on temperatures to understand how our results of operations are affected by temperatures that are warmer or colder than normal. Normal temperatures computed by us are the average of the last 10 years of information published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”). Based on this information we calculate a ratio of actual heating degree days to normal heating degree days. Heating degree days are a general indicator of weather impacting propane usage. Weather conditions have a significant impact on demand for propane for heating purposes primarily during the months of November through March (the “winter heating season”). Accordingly, the volume of propane used by our customers for this purpose is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in the regions we serve and can vary substantially from year to year. In any given region, sustained warmer-than-normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane usage, while sustained colder-than-normal temperatures will tend to result in greater usage. Although there is a strong correlation between weather and customer usage, general economic conditions in the United States and the wholesale price of propane can have a significant impact on this correlation. Additionally, there is a natural time lag between the onset of cold weather and increased sales to customers. If the United States were to experience a cooling trend, we could expect nationwide demand for propane to increase which could lead to greater sales, income and liquidity availability. Conversely, if the United States were to experience a continued warming trend, we could expect nationwide demand for propane for heating purposes to decrease which could lead to a reduction in our sales, income and liquidity availability as well as impact our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants. We employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase, storage, transport and sale of propane generally in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies. We attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments and forward propane purchase and sales contracts. We enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time. These commitments can expose us to product price risk if not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment. Our open financial derivative propane purchase commitments are designated as hedges primarily for fiscal 2023 and 2024 sales commitments and, as of January 31, 2023, we have experienced net mark-to-market losses of approximately $10.2 million. Because these financial derivative purchase commitments qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the resulting asset, liability and related mark-to-market gains or losses are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as “Prepaid expenses and other current assets,” “Other assets, net,” “Other current liabilities,” "Other liabilities" and “Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income,” respectively, until settled. Upon settlement, realized gains or losses on these contracts will be reclassified to “Cost of sales-propane and other gas liquid sales” in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as the underlying inventory is sold. These financial derivative purchase commitment net losses are expected to be offset by increased margins on propane sales commitments that qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception. At January 31, 2023, we estimate 92% of currently open financial derivative purchase commitments, the related propane sales commitments and the resulting gross margin will be realized into earnings during the next twelve months. Summary Discussion of Results of Operations: Executive Overview For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized net earnings attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. of $98.1 million and $108.4 million, respectively. This $10.3 million decrease was primarily driven by increases of $29.3 million in “Operating expense - personnel, vehicle, plant and other” and $7.3 million in “General and administrative expense.” Additionally, we recognized a $0.3 million loss compared to a $9.3 million gain on asset sales and disposals during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by a $34.0 million increase in “Gross margin.” Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors increased to $131.5 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $121.4 million for the prior year period, primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA and a $7.4 million decrease in net cash interest expense, which was partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in proceeds from asset sales. 44
Table of Contents For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, distributable cash flow excess was $112.7 million and $101.0 million, respectively. This $11.7 million increase was primarily due to the $10.1 million increase in distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors noted above and a $1.8 million decrease in distributions accrued or paid to preferred unitholders. For the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 During the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized net earnings attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. of $93.6 million and $99.8 million, respectively. This $6.2 million decrease was primarily driven by increases of $42.0 million in “Operating expense-personnel, vehicle, plant and other,” $9.6 million in “General and administrative expense” and $3.5 million in  “Depreciation and amortization expense.” Additionally, we recognized a $2.0 million loss compared to a $7.9 million gain on asset sales and disposals during the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by a $59.1 million increase in “Gross margin.” Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors increased to $153.5 million for the six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $136.7 million for the prior year period, primarily due to a $16.8 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA and a $3.9 million decrease in net cash interest expense, which was partially offset by a $2.6 million increase in maintenance capital expenditures. For the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, distributable cash flow excess was $118.0 million and $50.6 million, respectively. This $67.4 million increase was primarily due to a $50.0 million distribution paid to Class B Unitholders in the prior year period and the $16.8 million increase in distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors noted above.

99,799 Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this Quarterly Report we present the following Non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors, Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders, and Distributable cash flow excess. 45
Table of Contents Adjusted EBITDA . Adjusted EBITDA for Ferrellgas Partners is calculated as net earnings attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., plus the sum of the following: income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash employee stock ownership plan compensation charge, loss (gain) on asset sales and disposals, other income, net, severance costs, legal fees and settlements related to non-core businesses, and net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest. Management believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful because it allows investors to view the partnership’s performance in a manner similar to the method management uses, adjusted for items management believes make it easier to compare its results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures. Adjusted EBITDA, as management defines it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies. Items added into our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. This method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. Distributable Cash Flow Attributable to Equity Investors . Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA minus net cash interest expense, maintenance capital expenditures and cash paid for income taxes, plus proceeds from certain asset sales. Management considers distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors a meaningful measure of Ferrellgas’ ability to declare and pay quarterly distributions to equity investors, including holders of the operating partnership’s Preferred Units. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors, as management defines it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies. Items added into our calculation of distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. Distributable Cash Flow Attributable to Class A and B Unitholders . Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders is calculated as Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors minus distributions accrued or paid to Preferred Unitholders and distributable cash flow attributable to general partner and noncontrolling interest. Management considers Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders a meaningful measure of the partnership’s ability to declare and pay quarterly distributions to Class A and B Unitholders. Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders, as management defines it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies. Items added into our calculation of distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. Distributable Cash Flow Excess . Distributable cash flow excess is calculated as Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders minus Distributions paid to Class A and B Unitholders. Distributable cash flow excess, if any, is retained to establish reserves, to reduce debt, to fund capital expenditures and for other partnership purposes, and any shortage is funded from previously established reserves, cash on hand or borrowings under our Credit Facility. Management considers Distributable cash flow excess a meaningful measure of the partnership’s ability to effectuate those purposes. Distributable cash flow excess, as management defines it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies.

(b) “Other” primarily includes various customer fee income and to a lesser extent appliance and material sales. (c) Gross margin from "Propane and other gas liquids sales" represents "Revenues - Propane and other gas liquids sales" less "Cost of sales - Propane and other gas liquids sales" and does not include depreciation and amortization.

Table of Contents Propane sales volumes during the three months ended January 31, 2023 decreased 1%, or 2.6 million gallons, compared to the prior year period. Average temperatures (measured by heating degree days) were 3.9% warmer than normal (based on NOAA’s ten-year average) during the three months ended January 31, 2023 but 0.8% cooler than the three months ended January 31, 2022.
Our wholesale sales price per gallon partially correlates to the change in the wholesale market price of propane. The wholesale market price at major supply points in Mt. Belvieu, Texas during the three months ended January 31, 2023 averaged 31% less than the prior year period, while at the Conway, Kansas major supply point prices averaged 30% less than the prior year period. The wholesale market price at Mt. Belvieu, Texas averaged $0.79 and $1.15 per gallon during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, while the wholesale market price at Conway, Kansas averaged $0.80 and $1.15 per gallon during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This decrease in the wholesale cost of propane contributed to our decrease in sales price per gallon. Revenues Retail sales were flat compared to the prior year period with a $1.7 million increase despite a 1% decrease in gallons sold. New monitoring technology allows us to provide more gallons at each stop, thereby optimizing the use of our labor force and vehicle fleet and our fuel efficiency.
Wholesale sales decreased $6.0 million compared to the prior year period. Wholesale gallons sold decreased 2% or 1.0 million gallons compared to the prior year period.
Other gas sales decreased $1.3 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in sales volume. Other revenues increased $4.6 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to revenue from services to customers provided in support of final mile delivery operations. Gross margin - Propane and other gas liquids sales Gross margin increased $30.1 million primarily due to a $35.7 million decrease in related cost of sales as a result of decreases in price per gallon, which was partially offset by a $5.6 million decrease in revenue, both as discussed above. Margin per gallon for the quarter increased by $0.12, or 12%, compared to the prior year period.
Gross margin - other
Gross margin increased $3.9 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to increased miscellaneous fees billed to customers and increased tank rental income. Operating income Operating income decreased $12.9 million primarily due to a $36.7 million increase in
“Operating, general and administrative expense.” The $9.6 million change in “Loss (gain) on asset sales and disposals” primarily related to the prior year gain for the derecognition of a lease liability and related asset. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by a $34.0 million increase in “Gross margin.” “Operating, general and administrative expense” primarily increased due to a $29.3 million increase in “Operating expense – personnel, vehicle, plant and other” and a $7.3 million increase in “General and administrative expense.” “Operating expense – personnel, vehicle, plant and other” increased primarily due to higher fleet costs and fuel costs. “General and administrative expense,” after excluding a $6.3 million increase in legal fees related to non-core businesses, increased slightly by $1.0 million.
Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA increased $4.5 million primarily due to EBITDA adjustments related to a decrease of $9.6 million in gain on asset sales and disposals and an increase of $6.3 million of “Legal fees and settlements related to non-core businesses” in addition to a $1.9 million decrease in “Interest expense.” These increases were partially offset by the $12.9 million decrease in operating income, discussed above.

Table of Contents Propane sales volumes during the six months ended January 31, 2023 were flat compared to the prior year period with a slight decrease of 0.2 million gallons. Average temperatures (measured by heating degree days) were 5.0% warmer than normal (based on NOAA’s ten-year average) during the six months ended January 31, 2023 but 2.9% cooler than the six months ended January 31, 2022.
Our wholesale sales price per gallon partially correlates change in the wholesale market price of propane. The wholesale market price at major supply points in Mt. Belvieu, Texas during the six months ended January 31, 2023 averaged 27% less than the prior year period, while at the Conway, Kansas major supply point prices averaged 26% less than the prior year period. The wholesale market price at Mt. Belvieu, Texas averaged $0.89 and $1.22 per gallon during the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, while the wholesale market price at Conway, Kansas averaged $0.90 and $1.22 per gallon during the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This decrease in the wholesale cost of propane contributed to our decrease in sales price per gallon and therefore revenues. Revenues Retail sales increased $15.2 million compared to the prior year period due to continued focus on the management of the sales lifecycle, from asset utilization through final mile optimization and the strategic initiatives described above. Wholesale sales decreased $3.9 million compared to the prior year period corresponding to a 1% decrease in gallons sold as compared to the prior year period. Other gas sales decreased $3.7 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in sales volume. Other revenues increased $10.3 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to revenue from services to customers provided in support of final mile operations. Gross margin – Propane and other gas liquid sales Gross margin increased $50.7 million primarily due to a $43.2 million decrease in related cost of sales as a result of decreases in price per gallon and a $7.5 million increase in revenue, as discussed above. Gross margin – other Gross margin increased $8.4 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to increased miscellaneous fees billed to customers and increased tank rental income. Operating income Operating income decreased $5.4 million primarily due to a $51.6 million increase in “Operating, general and administrative expense” and a $3.5 million increase in “Depreciation and amortization expense.” The $9.8 million change in “Loss (gain) on asset sales and disposals” primarily related to the prior year gain for the derecognition of a lease liability and related asset. These decreases were partially offset by a $50.7 million increase in "Gross margin - Propane and other gas liquid sales" and an $8.4 million increase in “Gross margin – other,” both as discussed above.
“Operating, general and administrative expense” increased due to a $42.0 million increase in “Operating expense – personnel, vehicle, plant and other” and a $9.6 million increase in “General and administrative expense.” “Operating expense – personnel, vehicle, plant and other” increased primarily due to higher fleet and fuel costs. “General and administrative expense,” after excluding a $9.0 million increase in legal fees related to non-core businesses, was flat with a slight increase of $0.6 million.
Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA increased $16.8 million primarily due to EBITDA adjustments related to a decrease of $9.8 million in gain on asset sales and disposals and an increase of $9.0 million of “Legal fees and settlements related to non-core businesses” in addition to a $3.3 million decrease in “Other income, net.” These increases were partially offset by the $5.4 million decrease in operating income, discussed above.

Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operating activities, our Credit Facility and funds received from sales of debt and equity securities. As of January 31, 2023, our total liquidity was $386.1 million, which was comprised of $112.6 million in unrestricted cash and $273.5 million of availability under our Credit Facility. These sources of liquidity and short-term capital resources are intended to fund our working capital requirements, acquisitions and capital expenditures. As of January 31, 2023, letters of credit outstanding totaled $76.5 million. Our access to long-term capital resources, to the extent needed to refinance debt or for other purposes, may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, covenants in our debt agreements and other financial obligations, unforeseen demands on cash, or other events beyond our control.
As of January 31, 2023, we had $11.1 million of restricted cash consisting of a cash deposit made with the administrative agent under our prior senior secured credit facility that was terminated in April 2020. Our working capital requirements are subject to, among other things, the price of propane, delays in the collection of receivables, volatility in energy commodity prices, liquidity imposed by insurance providers, downgrades in our credit ratings, decreased trade credit, significant acquisitions, the weather, customer retention and purchasing patterns and other changes in the demand for propane. Relatively colder weather or higher propane prices during the winter heating season are factors that could significantly increase our working capital requirements. Our material known cash requirements continue to be our long-term debt, including current portion, and fixed rate interest obligations. These obligations reflect the operating partnership’s issuance of the $650.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes and the $825.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Notes. Our ability to satisfy our obligations is dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing weather, economic, financial and business conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Due to the seasonality of the retail propane distribution business, a significant portion of our propane operations and related products cash flows from operations is generated during the winter heating season. Our net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects earnings from our business activities adjusted for depreciation and amortization and changes in our working capital accounts. Historically, we generate significantly lower net cash from operating activities in our first and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to the seasonality of our propane operations and related equipment sales operations. During periods of high volatility, our risk management activities may expose us to the risk of counterparty margin calls in amounts greater than we have the capacity to fund. Likewise, our counterparties may not be able to fulfill their margin calls from us or may default on the settlement of positions with us. We believe that the liquidity available from cash flows from operating activities, unrestricted cash and the Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and letter of credit requirements for the foreseeable future. ​ 52

(1,470)   (6.9x) (a) DCF ratio is calculated as Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors divided by Cash distributions accrued or paid to equity investors. For the twelve months ended January 31, 2023, distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors increased $10.1 million compared to the twelve months ended October 31, 2022. As of January 31, 2023, the accrued quarterly distribution to Preferred Unitholders was $18.6 million. We paid $15.4 million of this distribution on February 15, 2023. The remaining $3.2 million represents Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units, pursuant to the side letters outlined in the OpCo LPA Amendment.
We did not pay any cash distributions to our Class A Unitholders during fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. Ferrellgas Partners made aggregate cash distributions of approximately $100.0 million to its Class B Unitholders during fiscal 2022. Cash reserves, which we utilize to meet future anticipated expenditures, were $179.2 million and $167.6 million for the twelve months ended January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively. Operating Activities Ferrellgas Partners Net cash provided by operating activities was $57.2 million and $51.5 million for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $5.7 million increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a $35.7 million decrease in working capital requirements, a $6.7 million increase in cash flow from operations, and a $2.4 million inflow associated with other assets and liabilities. These changes were partially offset by a $29.4 million increase in requirements for other current liabilities, an $8.8 million increase in requirements for prepaid expenses, and a $0.9 million increase in requirements for accrued interest expense. The $35.7 million decrease in working capital requirements was primarily due to a $31.6 million decrease in inventory requirements and a $39.4 million decrease in requirements for accounts and notes receivable, net. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $35.3 million in requirements for accounts payable. The $6.7 million increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to a $2.4 million decrease in interest expense and a $59.1 increase in gross profit, which was partially offset by an increase of $41.9 million in operating expenses, a $9.6 million increase in “General and administrative expense,” and a $3.3 million decrease in “Other income, net.” The $29.4 million increase in net cash used in operations related to other current liabilities was primarily driven by changes in the broker margin deposit liability. ​ 53
Table of Contents The operating partnership Net cash provided by operating activities was $57.2 million and $51.5 million for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $5.7 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $35.7 million decrease in working capital requirements, a $5.3 million increase in cash flow from operations, and a $3.7 million inflow associated with other assets and liabilities. These changes were partially offset by a $29.3 million increase in requirements for other current liabilities, an $8.8 million increase in requirements for prepaid expenses, and a $0.9 million increase in requirements for accrued interest expense. The $35.7 million decrease in working capital requirements was primarily due to a $31.6 million decrease in inventory requirements and a $39.4 million decrease in requirements for accounts and notes receivable, net. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $35.3 million in requirements for accounts payable.
The $5.3 million increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to a $2.4 million decrease in interest expense and a $59.1 increase in gross profit, which was partially offset by an increase of $41.9 million in operating expenses, a $9.6 million increase in “General and administrative expense,” and a $4.7 million decrease in “Other income, net.” The $29.3 million increase in net cash used in operations related to other current liabilities was primarily driven by changes in the broker margin deposit liability. Investing Activities Ferrellgas Partners Capital Requirements Our business requires continual investments to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations. Capital expenditures for our business consist primarily of: ● Maintenance capital expenditures - These capital expenditures include expenditures for betterment and replacement of property, plant and equipment, and may from time to time include the purchase of assets that are typically leased, rather than to generate incremental distributable cash flow. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures include a routine replacement of a worn-out asset or replacement of major vehicle components; and ● Growth capital expenditures - These expenditures are undertaken primarily to generate incremental distributable cash flow. Examples include expenditures for purchases of both bulk and portable propane tanks and other equipment to facilitate expansion of our customer base and operating capacity. Net cash used in investing activities was $59.3 million and $48.7 million for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $10.6 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to increases of $9.8 million in “Business acquisitions, net of cash acquired” and $0.8 million in “Capital expenditures.” Due to the mature nature of our operations, we do not anticipate significant fluctuations in maintenance capital expenditures, with the exception of future decisions regarding lease versus buy financing options. However, future fluctuations in growth capital expenditures could occur due to the opportunistic nature of these projects. The operating partnership The investing activities discussed above also apply to the operating partnership. ​ 54
Table of Contents Financing Activities Ferrellgas Partners Net cash used in financing activities was $32.8 million and $85.2 million for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $52.4 million decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to $50.0 million in distributions to Class B unitholders in the prior year period and a $2.3 million decrease in cash payments for the principal portion of our finance lease liability. Letters of credit outstanding at January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 totaled $76.5 million and $87.6 million, respectively, and were used to secure insurance arrangements, product purchases and commodity hedges. As of January 31, 2023, we had available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility of $273.5 million. The operating partnership The financing activities discussed above also apply to the operating partnership except for cash flows related to distributions paid, as discussed below. Distributions Partnership distributions The Sixth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. (the “Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA”) requires Ferrellgas Partners to make quarterly cash distributions of all of its “available cash.” Available cash is defined in the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA as, generally, the sum of Ferrellgas’ Partners cash receipts less consolidated cash disbursements and net changes in reserves established by our general partner for future requirements. In general, the amount of Ferrellgas Partners’ available cash depends primarily on whether and the extent to which Ferrellgas Partners receives cash distributions from the operating partnership, as such distributions generally would be Ferrellgas Partners’ only significant cash receipts. The Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Ferrellgas, L.P. (the “Amended OpCo LPA”), as amended by the First Amendment to the Amended OpCo LPA (the “OpCo LPA Amendment”), sets forth the preferences, rights, privileges and other terms of the Preferred Units. Pursuant to the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA, while any Class B Units remain outstanding, any distributions by Ferrellgas Partners to its partners must be made such that the ratio of (i) the amount of distributions made to holders of Class B Units to (ii) the amount of distributions made to holders of Class A Units and the general partner is not less than 6:1. The Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA permits Ferrellgas Partners, in the general partner’s discretion, to make distributions to the Class B Unitholders in a greater proportion than the minimum 6:1 ratio, including paying 100% of any such distribution to Class B Unitholders. The Class B Units will not be convertible into Class A Units until Class B Unitholders receive distributions in the aggregate amount of $357.0 million, which was the $357.0 million aggregate principal amount of Ferrellgas Partners’ unsecured senior notes due June 15, 2020 (the “Ferrellgas Partners Notes”), and the rate at which Class B Units will convert into Class A Units increases annually. Additionally, the price at which Ferrellgas Partners may redeem the Class B Units during the first five years after March 30, 2021 is based on the Class B Unitholders’ receipt of a specified internal rate of return in respect of their Class B Units. This specified internal rate of return in respect of the Class B Units is 15.85%, but that amount increases under certain circumstances, including if the operating partnership paid distributions on the Preferred Units in-kind rather than in cash for a certain number of quarters. Accordingly, distributing cash to the Class B Unitholders in a greater proportion than the minimum 6:1 ratio could result in the Class B Units becoming convertible into Class A Units more quickly or at a lower conversion rate or reduce the redemption price for the Class B Units. For additional discussion of the terms of the Class B Units, see Note G – Equity (Deficit) in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. 55
Table of Contents For these reasons, although the general partner has not made any decisions or adopted any policy with respect to the allocation of future distributions by Ferrellgas Partners to its partners, the general partner may determine that it is advisable to pay more than the minimum amount of any distribution, up to 100% of the amount of such distribution, to the Class B Unitholders. On October 8, 2021 and July 8, 2022, Ferrellgas Partners made cash distributions aggregating in total to approximately $100.0 million entirely to the Class B Unitholders, without making any distribution to Class A Unitholders and the general partner. In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022, see “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in an Investment in our Class A or Class B Units or our Debt Securities and Other Risks Related to Our Capital Structure and Financing Arrangements—If Ferrellgas Partners is permitted to make and makes distributions to its partners, while any Class B Units remain outstanding, Class B Unitholders collectively will receive at least approximately 85.7% of the aggregate amount of each such distribution and may receive up to 100% of any such distribution. Accordingly, while any Class B Units remain outstanding, Class A Unitholders may not receive any distributions and, in any case, will not receive collectively more than approximately 14.1% of any distribution.” Ferrellgas Partners did not pay any distributions to Class A Unitholders, Class B Unitholders or the general partner during the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, except for the distribution to Class B Unitholders of approximately $49.9 million on October 8, 2021. The ability of Ferrellgas Partners to make cash distributions to its Class A Unitholders and Class B Unitholders is dependent on the receipt by Ferrellgas Partners of cash distributions from the operating partnership. For so long as any Preferred Units remain outstanding, the amount of cash that otherwise would be available for distribution by the operating partnership to Ferrellgas Partners and the general partner will be reduced by the amount of cash distributions and other payments made by the operating partnership in respect of the Preferred Units, including payments to redeem Preferred Units. Further, the indentures governing the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes, the credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for a four-year revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $350.0 million, and the OpCo LPA Amendment which sets forth the preferences, rights, privileges and other terms governing the Preferred Units each contain covenants that limit the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to Ferrellgas Partners and therefore effectively limit the ability of Ferrellgas Partners to make distributions to its Class A Unitholders and Class B Unitholders. See Note E – Debt and Note F – Preferred units for a discussion of these limitations. In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022, see “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in an Investment in our Class A or Class B Units or our Debt Securities and Other Risks Related to Our Capital Structure and Financing Arrangements—Restrictive covenants in the Indentures, the Credit Agreement and the agreements governing our other future indebtedness and other financial obligations may reduce our operating flexibility and ability to make cash distributions to holders of Class A Units and Class B Units. The Indentures, the Credit Agreement and the OpCo LPA Amendment contain important exceptions to the covenants.” Preferred unit distributions Pursuant to the OpCo LPA Amendment, the operating partnership is required to pay to the holders of each Preferred Unit a cumulative, quarterly distribution (the "Quarterly Distribution") at the Distribution Rate (as defined below) on the unit purchase price of such Preferred Unit, which is $1,000 per unit. "Distribution Rate" means, for the first five years after March 30, 2021, a rate per annum equal to 8.956%, with certain increases in the Distribution Rate on each of the 5 th , 6 th  and 7 th  anniversaries of March 30, 2021, subject to a maximum rate of 11.125% and certain other adjustments and exceptions. The Quarterly Distribution may be paid in cash or, at the election of the operating partnership, “in kind” through the issuance of additional Preferred Units (“PIK Units”) at the quarterly Distribution Rate plus an applicable premium that escalates each year from 75 bps to 300 bps so long as the Preferred Units remain outstanding. In the event the operating partnership fails to make any Quarterly Distribution in cash, such Quarterly Distribution will automatically be paid in PIK Units. The Distribution Rate on the Preferred Units will increase upon violation of certain protective provisions for the benefit of Preferred Unit holders notwithstanding the cap mentioned above. 56
Table of Contents As of January 31, 2023, the Quarterly Distribution accrued was $18.6 million. On February 15, 2023, $15.4 million of the Quarterly Distribution was paid in cash to holders of Preferred Units. The remaining Quarterly Distribution accrual of $3.2 million represents Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units pursuant to the side letters outlined in the OpCo LPA Amendment. As of January 31, 2022, the Quarterly Distribution accrued was $17.7 million. On February 15, 2022, $15.4 million of the Quarterly Distribution was paid in cash to holders of the Preferred Units. The remaining Quarterly Distribution accrued of $2.3 million represented Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units pursuant to the side letters. Preferred unit tax distributions For any quarter in which the operating partnership makes a Quarterly Distribution in PIK Units in lieu of cash, it shall make a subsequent cash tax distribution for such quarter in an amount equal to the (i) the lesser of (x) 25% and (y) the highest combined federal, state and local tax rate applicable for corporations organized in New York, multiplied by (ii) the excess (if any) of (A) one-fourth (1/4th) of the estimated taxable income to be allocated to the holders of Preferred Units for the year in which the Quarterly Tax Payment Date (which refers to certain specified dates that next follow a Quarterly Distribution date on which PIK Units were issued) occurs, over (B) any cash paid on the Quarterly Distribution date immediately preceding the Quarterly Tax Payment Date on which a quarterly tax amount would otherwise be paid (such amount, the "Tax Distribution"). Tax Distributions are treated as advances against, and reduce, future cash distributions for any reason, including payments in redemption of Preferred Units or PIK Units, or payments to the holders in their capacity as such pursuant to any side letter or other agreement. Cash distributions paid Ferrellgas Partners did not pay any cash distributions to its Class A Unitholders during the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. On October 8, 2021, Ferrellgas Partners paid a cash distribution to holders of the Class B Units in the amount of $38.46 per Class B Unit or approximately $49.9 million in the aggregate. As permitted by the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA as described above, Ferrellgas Partners made this distribution solely to Class B Unitholders without any contemporaneous distribution to Class A Unitholders and the general partner. On September 14, 2021, the operating partnership paid a cash distribution to Ferrellgas Partners in the amount of approximately $49.9 million, which Ferrellgas Partners used to pay the October 8, 2021 distribution to its Class B Unitholders described above. The operating partnership also paid cash distributions for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 in respect of its Preferred Units as discussed above under “—Preferred unit distributions.” The operating partnership The financing activities discussed above also apply to the operating partnership except for distributions by Ferrellgas Partners related to the Class B Units. Disclosures about Effects of Transactions with Related Parties We have no employees and are managed and controlled by our general partner. Pursuant to our partnership agreements, our general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on our behalf, and all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to us or otherwise reasonably incurred by our general partner in connection with operating our business. These reimbursable costs, which totaled $171.4 million for the six months ended January 31, 2023, include operating expenses such as compensation and benefits paid to employees of our general partner who perform services on our behalf as well as related general and administrative expenses. During the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the operating partnership paid distributions to Ferrellgas Partners as described above.
Material Cash Requirements As of January 31, 2023, there have been no material changes to our material cash requirements from those described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Material Cash Requirements” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2022. For additional information regarding our debt obligations, see Note E – Debt to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents The operating partnership The contractual obligations discussed above also apply to the operating partnership. ITEM 3.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We did not enter into any risk management trading activities during the six months ended January 31, 2023. Our remaining market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be “other than trading.” Commodity price risk management Our risk management activities primarily attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase, storage, transport and sale of propane generally in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies. We attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments and forward propane purchase and sales contracts. Our risk management strategy involves taking positions in the forward or financial markets that are equal and opposite to our positions in the physical products market in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change. This risk management strategy is successful when our gains or losses in the physical product markets are offset by our losses or gains in the forward or financial markets. Our propane related financial derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Our risk management activities include the use of financial derivative instruments including, but not limited to, futures, swaps, and options to seek protection from adverse price movements and to minimize potential losses. We enter into these financial derivative instruments with brokers who are clearing members with the Intercontinental Exchange or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and, to a lesser extent, directly with third parties in the over-the-counter market. We also enter into forward propane purchase and sales contracts with counterparties. These forward contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sales exception within GAAP guidance and are therefore not recorded on our financial statements until settled. Transportation Fuel Price Risk From time to time, our risk management activities also attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase of gasoline and diesel fuel for use in the transport of propane from supply or storage locations and from retail fueling stations. When employed, we attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. When employed, our risk management strategy involves taking positions in the financial markets that are not more than the forecasted purchases of fuel for our internal use in the supply and retail propane delivery fleet in order to minimize the risk of decreased earnings from an adverse price change. This risk management strategy locks in our purchase price and is successful when our gains or losses in the physical product markets are offset by our losses or gains in the financial markets. Our transport fuel financial derivatives are not designated as cash flow hedges. Risk Policy and Sensitivity Analysis Market risks associated with energy commodities are monitored daily by senior management for compliance with our commodity risk management policy. This policy includes an aggregate dollar loss limit and limits on the term of various contracts. We also utilize volume limits for various energy commodities and review our positions daily where we remain exposed to market risk, so as to manage exposures to changing market prices. We have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate the exposure to market risk of our energy commodity positions. Forward contracts, futures, swaps and options outstanding as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 that were used in our risk management activities were analyzed assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse change in prices for the delivery month for all energy commodities. The potential loss in future earnings from these positions due to a 10% adverse movement in market prices of the underlying energy commodities was estimated at $7.8 million and $20.6 million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively. The preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in prices may or may not equal 10%, thus actual results may differ. Our sensitivity analysis does not include the anticipated transactions associated with these transactions, which we anticipate will be 100% effective. 58
Table of Contents Credit risk We maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe significantly reduce overall credit risk. These policies include evaluating and monitoring our counterparties’ financial condition (including credit ratings), and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit guidelines. Our other counterparties principally consist of major energy companies that are suppliers, marketers, wholesalers, retailers and end users; and major U.S. financial institutions. The overall impact due to certain changes in economic, regulatory and other events may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively in that counterparties may be similarly impacted. Based on our policies, exposures, credit and other reserves, management does not anticipate a material adverse effect on financial position or results of operations as a result of counterparty performance. Interest rate risk We had variable rate indebtedness outstanding related to our letters of credit under our Credit Facility of $76.5 million and $87.6 million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates to the extent that we have variable rate indebtedness (including any disbursements or payments related to letters of credit) outstanding under our Credit Facility. Critical accounting estimates Our critical accounting estimates are disclosed under “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates” in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2022. During the six months ended January 31, 2023, no modifications were made to these critical accounting estimates. ITEM 4.      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES An evaluation was performed by the management of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., Ferrellgas, L.P., Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., and Ferrellgas Finance Corp., with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our general partner, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, were effective as of January 31, 2023. The management of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., Ferrellgas, L.P., Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Based on the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the above mentioned partnerships and corporations have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Therefore, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide such reasonable assurances of achieving our desired control objectives, and the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our general partner have concluded, as of January 31, 2023, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in achieving that level of reasonable assurance. During the most recent fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2023, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ​ 59
