You can generally identify forward-looking statements by our use of forward-looking terminology such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” or “should,” or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. Statements about the growth of or other future developments relating to our various markets and statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, prospects, assumptions or future events or performance contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These and other important factors, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part 1, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements include: • the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other widespread public health crises on our business, industry and results of operations; • general business, financial market and economic conditions, including inflation and deflation, rising interest rates, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and capital market volatility; • our dependency upon the cyclical commercial and residential construction markets, both new and repair and remodeling, including any impact from the developing slow-down in single-family construction; • competition in our highly fragmented industry and the markets in which we operate; • consolidation in our industry; • the fluctuations in prices and mix of the products we distribute, including fluctuations caused by geopolitical conflicts, and our ability to pass on price increases to our customers and effectively manage inventories and margins in both inflationary and deflationary pricing environments; • our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy, including through making and integrating acquisitions, opening new branches and expanding our product offerings; • our ability to expand into new geographic markets; • product shortages, other disruptions in our supply chain or distribution network and potential loss of relationships with key suppliers, including increased shipping costs and delays and heightened risks relating to sourcing products from international suppliers; • our ability to drive improved productivity and profitability, including managing operating costs and achieving productivity initiatives; • the potential loss of any significant customers, a reduction of the quantity of products our customers purchase or inability to pay; • our ability to renew leases for our facilities on favorable terms or secure new facilities on acceptable terms; • our ability to effectively manage our inventory as our sales volume or the prices of the products we distribute fluctuate; • significant fluctuations in fuel costs or shortages in the supply of fuel; 3 • natural or man-made disruptions to our facilities; • the risk of our Canadian operations, including currency rate fluctuations; • our ability to continue to anticipate and address evolving consumer demands; • exposure to product liability and various other claims and litigation, and the adequacy and costs of insurance related thereto; • operating hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage; • the impact of federal, state, provincial and local regulations, including potential changes in our effective tax rate; • our inability to engage in activities that may be in our best long-term interests because of restrictions in our debt agreements; • our current level of indebtedness and our potential to incur additional indebtedness; • our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all; • our ability to attract and retain key employees while controlling costs, including the impact of labor and trucking shortages; • cybersecurity breach, including misappropriation of our customers’, employees’ or suppliers’ confidential information, and the potential costs related thereto; • a disruption in our IT systems and costs necessary to maintain and update our IT systems; and • the imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers, and the effect of any retaliatory trade measures. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and events may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statement that we make in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q speaks only as of the date of such statement. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise, or to publicly announce any update or revision to, any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Business Founded in 1971, GMS Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “we,” “our,” “us,” or the “Company”), through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, operates a network of approximately
300
distribution centers with extensive product offerings of wallboard, ceilings, steel framing and complementary construction products. The Company also operates approximately
100
tool sales, rental and service centers. Through these operations, the Company provides a comprehensive selection of building products and solutions for its residential and commercial contractor customer base across the United States and Canada. The Company’s unique operating model combines the benefits of a national platform and strategy with a local go-to-market focus, enabling the Company to generate significant economies of scale while maintaining high levels of customer service.
Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for any other interim period or the entire fiscal year. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. Principles of Consolidation The condensed consolidated financial statements present the results of operations, financial position, stockholders’ equity and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations of businesses acquired are included from their respective dates of acquisition. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, while income and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. Translation gains and losses are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income within other income, net. Insurance Liabilities The Company is self-insured for certain losses related to medical claims. The Company has stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure arising from medical claims. In addition, the Company has deductible-based insurance policies for certain losses related to general liability, automobile and workers’ compensation. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date is not discounted and is recognized as a liability if probable and estimable. Insurance losses for claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical loss development factors and actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry. 10 GMS Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (Continued) The following table presents the Company’s aggregate liabilities for medical self-insurance, general liability, automobile and workers’ compensation and the expected recoveries for medical self-insurance, general liability, automobile and workers’ compensation. Liabilities for medical self-insurance are included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities. Reserves for general liability, automobile and workers’ compensation are included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities and other liabilities. Expected recoveries for insurance liabilities are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. January 31, 2023 April 30, 2022 (in thousands) Medical self‑insurance $ 4,602   $ 3,371   General liability, automobile and workers’ compensation 27,353   21,707   Expected recoveries for insurance liabilities ( 8,321 ) ( 4,973 ) Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of contracted goods to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. The Company includes shipping and handling costs billed to customers in net sales. These costs are recognized as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 13, “Segments,” for information regarding disaggregation of revenue, including revenue by product and by geographic area. Income Taxes The Company considers each interim period an integral part of the annual period and measures tax expense (benefit) using an estimated annual effective income tax rate. Estimates of the annual effective income tax rate at the end of interim periods are, out of necessity, based on evaluation of possible future events and transactions and may be subject to subsequent refinement or revision. The Company forecasts its estimated annual effective income tax rate and then applies that rate to its year-to-date pre-tax ordinary income (loss), subject to certain loss limitation provisions. In addition, certain specific transactions are excluded from the Company’s estimated annual effective tax rate computation but are discretely recognized within income tax expense (benefit) in their respective interim period. Future changes in annual income (loss) projections, tax rate changes, or discrete tax items could result in significant adjustments to quarterly income tax expense (benefit) in future periods. The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required. In this evaluation, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The primary negative evidence considered includes the cumulative operating losses generated in prior periods. The primary positive evidence considered includes the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to depreciation and amortization that would occur within the same jurisdiction and during the carryforward period necessary to absorb the federal and state net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed by applying the federal, provincial and state income tax rates in effect to the gross amounts of temporary differences and other tax attributes, such as net operating loss carry-forwards. In assessing if the deferred tax assets will be realized, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of these deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which these deductible temporary differences reverse. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, including stock options and restricted stock units (collectively “Common Stock Equivalents”), were exercised or converted into common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. In
11 GMS Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (Continued) applying the treasury stock method for stock-based compensation arrangements, the assumed proceeds are computed as the sum of the amount the employee must pay upon exercise and the amount of compensation cost attributed to future services and not yet recognized. Diluted earnings per share is computed by increasing the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock computed in basic earnings per share to include the dilutive effect of Common Stock Equivalents for the period. In periods of net loss, the number of shares used to calculate diluted loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Reference Rate Reform
– In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance to temporarily ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rates that are expected to be discontinued, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally could be applied through December 31, 2022. However, the new guidance was not applicable to contract modifications made, and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after, December 31, 2022. The Company adopted this guidance when its relevant contracts were modified to alternative reference rates. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Business Combinations
– In October 2021, the FASB issued new guidance which requires the recognition and measurement of contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Code 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." This creates an exception to the general recognition and measurement principles in existing business combination guidance. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this new guidance should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 2.
Business Combinations The Company accounts for business combinations by recognizing the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value. In valuing certain acquired assets and liabilities, fair value estimates use Level 3 inputs, including future expected cash flows and discount rates. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the Company’s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments arising from new facts and circumstances are recorded to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The results of operations of acquisitions are reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. Westside Acquisition During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company settled its $ 13.5
million holdback liability related to the acquisition of Westside Building Material (“Westside”) in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement. The holdback liability was for general representations and warranties of the sellers and was settled
15
months after the acquisition date. Fiscal 2023 Acquisitions On June 1, 2022, the Company acquired certain assets of Construction Supply of Southwest Florida, Inc. (“CSSWF”). CSSWF is a distributor of various stucco, building and waterproofing supplies serving markets in the southwest Florida area. The impact of this acquisition is not material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. On December 30, 2022, the Company acquired certain assets of Tanner Bolt and Nut, Inc. ("Tanner"). Tanner is a distributor of various tools, fasteners, sealants and related construction products to the broader New York City market through its four distribution facilities. The impact of this acquisition is not material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their acquisition date fair values. The acquisition accounting is subject to change as the Company obtains additional information during the measurement period about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates. The primary areas of the preliminary acquisition accounting that are not yet finalized relate to preliminary fair value estimates, working capital adjustments and residual goodwill. 12 GMS Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (Continued) The following table summarizes the preliminary acquisition accounting for the Company's fiscal 2023 acquisitions based on currently available information: Preliminary Acquisition Accounting (in thousands) Trade accounts and notes receivable $ 5,487   Inventories 7,824   Prepaid and other current assets 1,607   Property and equipment 1,336   Customer relationships 4,800   Tradenames 1,400   Goodwill 2,094   Accounts payable and other liabilities ( 4,249 ) Fair value of consideration transferred $ 20,299   Goodwill recognized is attributable to expected synergies, increased market presence and the expected value to expand and enhance the Company's complementary product offerings. Goodwill is expected to be deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The estimated useful life for the customer relationships is

The Company is required to make scheduled quarterly payments of $ 1.3
million, or
0.25 % of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan Facility, with the remaining balance due in June 2025. The Term Loan Facility bears interest at a floating rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus
2.50 % plus a credit spread adjustment. As of January 31, 2023, the applicable rate of interest was
6.94 %. The Company has interest rate swap agreements to convert the variable interest rate on a portion of its Term Loan Facility to a fixed rate. For more information, see Note 11, "Fair Value Measurements."
On December 22, 2022, the Company amended its Term Loan Facility to, among other things, add the Company’s indirect Canadian subsidiaries (the “Canadian Subsidiaries”) as loan parties under the Term Loan Facility, permit the amendments to the Company's asset based revolving credit facility and replace LIBOR as the benchmark rate with SOFR. The indebtedness and obligations under the Term Loan Facility are (or, with respect to the Company's Canadian Subsidiaries, will be) secured by a second-priority security interest in substantially all of the current assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (including the Canadian Subsidiaries) and a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the fixed assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (including the Canadian Subsidiaries), subject to exclusions as set forth in the Term Loan Facility and related loan documents. Senior Notes The Company has senior unsecured notes due May 2029 (the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes bear interest at
4.625 % per annum and mature on May 1, 2029. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1. Asset Based Lending Facility The Company has an asset based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Facility”) that provides for aggregate revolving commitments of $ 950.0
million as of January 31, 2023. Extensions of credit under the ABL Facility are limited by a borrowing base calculated periodically based on specified percentages of the value of eligible inventory and accounts receivable, subject to certain reserves and other adjustments. On December 22, 2022, the Company amended its ABL Facility to, among other things, (i) increase the commitments thereunder by $ 405.0
million from $ 545.0
million to $ 950.0
million, (ii) join the Company’s Canadian Subsidiaries as credit parties thereunder, (iii) include certain assets of the Canadian Subsidiaries in the borrowing base, (iv) include the ability to borrow in Canadian dollars in an amount not to exceed $ 200  million, (v) extend the maturity date by
five years
from the closing
16 GMS Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (Continued) date of the amendment to December 22, 2027 and (vi) increase the incremental debt capacity available thereunder. In connection with the amendment, the Company terminated its revolving credit facility it had through one of its Canadian subsidiaries (the “Canadian Facility”). As of January 31, 2023, at the Company’s option, the interest rates applicable to the loans under the ABL Facility were based on SOFR or base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The margins applicable for each elected interest rate are subject to a pricing grid, as defined in the ABL Facility agreement, based on average daily availability for the most recent fiscal quarter. The ABL Facility also contains an unused commitment fee. As of January 31, 2023, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings was
6.09 %. As of January 31, 2023, the Company had available borrowing capacity of approximately $ 574.4
million under the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility matures on December 22, 2027 (or, if earlier, 91 days before the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility). The ABL Facility contains a cross default provision with the Term Loan Facility. Debt Covenants The Term Loan Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes contain a number of covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, as described in the respective credit agreement and the indenture, to incur more indebtedness; pay dividends, redeem or repurchase stock or make other distributions; make investments; create restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to us or make other intercompany transfers; create liens securing indebtedness; transfer or sell assets; merge or consolidate; enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and prepay or amend the terms of certain indebtedness. Such covenants are subject to several important exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Term Loan Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes. As of January 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Term Loan Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes. The ABL Facility contains certain affirmative covenants, including financial and other reporting requirements. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of January 31, 2023.

Income Taxes General.
The Company’s effective income tax rate on continuing operations was
26.3 % and
24.8 % for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The difference in the effective income tax rate over the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was primarily due to the impact of foreign and state taxes.
Valuation allowance . The Company had a valuation allowance of $ 11.7
million against its deferred tax assets related to certain U.S. tax jurisdictions as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022. To the extent the Company generates sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize the tax benefits of the net deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance is recorded, the effective tax rate may decrease as the valuation allowance is reversed. Uncertain tax positions . The Company had
no
uncertain tax positions as of January 31, 2023 or April 30, 2022. 8.
Stockholders’ Equity Share Repurchases On June 20, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved an expanded share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $ 200.0
million of its outstanding common stock. This expanded program replaced the Company’s previous share repurchase authorization of $ 75.0
million. The Company may conduct repurchases under the share repurchase program through open market transactions, under trading plans in accordance with SEC Rule 10b5-1 and/or in privately negotiated transactions, in each case in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing and amount of any purchases of the Company's common stock are subject to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the Company’s liquidity, credit availability, general business and market conditions, debt covenants and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any amount of common stock, and it may be suspended or terminated at any time at the Company’s discretion.
The Company repurchased approximately
1.8
million shares of its common stock for $ 82.8
million during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, of which $ 10.8
million was repurchased under the previous authorization and $ 72.0
million was repurchased under the new authorization. The Company repurchased approximately
0.4

90 % of the lower of the closing price at the beginning or end of the purchase period, which is a
six-month
period ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year.  The Company recognized $ 0.8
million and $ 0.5
million of stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

million during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Current and long-term liabilities for stock appreciation rights, deferred compensation and redeemable noncontrolling interests are included in other accrued expenses and liabilities and other liabilities, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 13, "Stock Appreciation Rights, Deferred Compensation and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests," in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022 for more information regarding stock appreciation rights, deferred compensation and redeemable noncontrolling interests. 11.
Fair Value Measurements Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following table presents the estimated carrying amount and fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: January 31, 2023 April 30, 2022 (in thousands) Interest rate swaps (Level 2) $ 810   $ ( 1,136 ) The Company has interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $ 500.0
million to convert the variable interest rate on a portion of its Term Loan Facility to a fixed 1-month LIBOR interest rate of
2.46 %. The contracts were effective on February 28, 2019 and terminate on February 28, 2023. The objective of the interest rate swap agreements is to eliminate the variability of interest payment cash flows associated with variable interest rates. The Company believes there have been no material changes in the creditworthiness of the counterparties to these interest rate swaps and believes the risk of nonperformance by each party is minimal. The Company designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
As of January 31, 2023, the interest rate swap assets were classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of April 30, 2022, the interest rate swap liabilities were classified in other accrued expenses and current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company recognized gains, net of tax, of $ 1.6
million and losses, net of tax, of $ 2.3
million during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to its interest rate swaps. The Company recognized losses, net of tax, of $ 0.5
million and $ 6.8
million during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts are included in interest expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and within cash flows from operating activities within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of January 31, 2023, the Company expects that approximately $ 0.8
22 GMS Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (Continued) million of pre-tax earnings will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings during the next twelve months. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using Level 2 inputs. Generally, the Company obtains the Level 2 inputs from its counterparties. Substantially all the inputs throughout the full term of the instruments can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. The fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap was determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of the derivative. This analysis reflected the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and used observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Disclosures are required for certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods after initial recognition. Such measurements of fair value relate primarily to assets and liabilities measured at fair value in connection with business combinations and long-lived asset impairments. For more information on business combinations, see Note 2, “Business Combinations.” There were no material long-lived asset impairments during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 or 2022. Fair Value of Debt The estimated fair value of the Company’s Senior Notes was determined based on Level 2 input using observable market prices in less active markets. The carrying amounts of the Company’s Term Loan Facility and ABL Facility approximate their fair value as the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates.
The following table presents the carrying amount and fair value of the Company’s Senior Notes: January 31, 2023 April 30, 2022 Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value (in thousands) Senior Notes $ 350,000   $ 290,500   $ 350,000   $ 310,625   12.
Commitments and Contingencies The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits and administrative actions associated with personal injuries, property damage, environmental matters, product liability claims, claims of former employees and other events arising in the normal course of business. As discussed in Note 1 “—Insurance Liabilities”, the Company records liabilities for these claims, and assets for amounts recoverable from the insurer, for claims covered by insurance. 23 GMS Inc.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following information should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” and discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022. Overview Founded in 1971, GMS Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” or the “Company”), through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries,
operates a network of approximately 300 distribution centers with extensive product offerings of wallboard, ceilings, steel framing and complementary construction products. GMS also operates approximately 100 tool sales, rental and service centers. Through these operations, GMS provides a comprehensive selection of building products and solutions for its residential and commercial contractor customer base across the United States and Canada. The Company’s unique operating model combines the benefits of a national platform and strategy with a local go-to-market focus, enabling GMS to generate significant economies of scale while maintaining high levels of customer service.
Market Conditions and Outlook Residential After experiencing strong underlying demand for our residential products since mid-2020 as favorable demographics, low interest rates, low levels of new and existing homes for sale, a strong job market and a change in workplace habits and preferences resulting from COVID-19 helped drive new home purchases, we are now starting to see the early stages of a slowdown in single-family construction demand, primarily as a result of rising interest rates and inflation, along with broader macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. However, while multi-family starts have moderated from their exceptionally high levels during calendar year 2022, we expect strength in multi-family residential construction demand to continue through at least mid-year calendar 2023 as there remains a large backlog between starts and completions in that industry segment. More broadly, while affordability issues have created some near-term uncertainty, the solid underlying demand fundamentals of the housing market, including favorable demographics and low levels of supply of new homes, are expected to provide support for that market in the longer term. In addition, we believe the Company continues to be well-positioned to adjust as needed to meet demand in all of our end markets due to our broad mix of customers, including commercial, multi-family and single-family builders and contractors, product offerings and geographic scope.
Commercial Demand for commercial projects was severely impacted by COVID-19 and has been slow to recover in certain sectors. However, we are starting to see some improvement, including stronger year-over-year commercial wallboard sales and volumes. Construction to support medical, hospitality and governmental projects has started to rebound, particularly where commercial development has followed residential expansion. Larger office projects, both new and for repair and remodeling (“R&R”), however, remain tempered, particularly in more mature urban markets.
As with residential contractors, both we and commercial contractors face inflationary pressures and availability constraints for fuel, labor, building products and other miscellaneous expenses. Cost Reduction Initiatives Given recent end market dynamics, subsequent to January 31, 2023, we implemented cost reduction initiatives to better align our operations with the current demand outlook. These initiatives are expected to reduce fixed selling, general and administrative expenses. 27 Business Strategy The key elements of our business strategy are as follows: • Expand Core Products . Our business strategy includes an emphasis on expanding our market share in our core products (wallboard, ceilings and steel framing).
• Grow Complementary Products . We are focused on growing our complementary product lines (insulation, lumber, ready-mix joint compound, tools, fasteners, exterior insulation finishing systems (EIFS) and various other construction products) to better serve our customers and diversify and expand our product offerings while driving higher sales and margins. • Expand our Platform . Our growth strategy includes the pursuit of both greenfield openings and strategic acquisitions to further broaden our geographic markets, enhance our service levels and expand our product offerings.      ◦ Greenfield openings . Our strategy for opening new distribution centers is to further penetrate markets that are adjacent to our existing operations. Typically, we have pre-existing customer relationships in these markets but need a new location to fully capitalize on those relationships.
◦ Acquisitions . We also have a proven history of consummating acquisitions in new and contiguous markets and intend to continue to pursue acquisitions. Due to the large, highly fragmented nature of our markets and our reputation throughout the industry, we believe we will continue to have access to a robust acquisition pipeline to supplement our organic growth. We use a rigorous targeting process to identify acquisition candidates that we believe will fit our culture and business model and we have built an experienced team of professionals to manage the acquisition and integration processes. As a result of our scale, purchasing power and ability to improve operations through implementing best practices, we believe we can continue to achieve substantial synergies and drive earnings accretion from our acquisition strategy.
• Drive Improved Productivity and Profitability . Our business strategy entails a focus on enhanced productivity and profitability across the organization, seeking to leverage our scale and employ both technology and other best practices to deliver further margin expansion and earnings growth. We expect to continue to capture profitable market share in our existing footprint by delivering industry-leading customer service.
COVID-19 Update We continue to actively monitor the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 and its contributory effects on the economy and on our business. We will continue to implement, as deemed necessary or advisable, procedures and processes to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers.
We may take actions that alter our business operations if required by federal, state, provincial or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and stockholders. Furthermore, while COVID-19 had a limited impact on our financial results and operations during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, there is no guarantee that COVID-19 or its contributory effects on the economy will not have a material impact on our future financial results or operations. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022 for a discussion of risks which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results and for more information regarding the impact of COVID-19 and our response. 28 Highlights     Key highlights in our business during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 are described below: • Generated net sales of $4,025.2 million during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, a 20.3% increase from the prior year period, primarily due to inflationary pricing along with strength in multi-family residential construction activity and an improving commercial landscape, both of which helped drive volume growth in wallboard and complementary products. We also benefited from acquisitions we completed over the past year. In addition, there was one additional selling day during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period. • Generated net income of $257.4 million during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, a 30.7% increase compared to the prior year, primarily due to the increase in net sales noted above, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses, and an increase in the provision for income taxes. Supply chain dynamics led to high levels of product inflation, which have been the principal driver of both sales growth and incremental profitability.
• Generated Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in this Item 2) of $511.4 million during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, a 23.9% increase compared to the prior year, primarily due to the increase in net sales noted above. Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 12.7% for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to 12.3% for the nine months ended January 31, 2022, primarily due to better operating leverage, as product price inflation on sales outpaced operating cost inflation. • Completed two acquisitions and opened five greenfield locations. Recent Developments Acquisitions On June 1, 2022, we acquired certain assets of Construction Supply of Southwest Florida, Inc. (“CSSWF”). CSSWF is a distributor of various stucco, building and waterproofing supplies serving markets in the southwest Florida area. On December 30, 2022, we acquired certain assets of Tanner Bolt and Nut, Inc. (“Tanner”). Tanner is a distributor of various tools, fasteners, sealants and related construction products to the broader New York City market through its four distribution facilities. For more information regarding our acquisitions, see Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Greenfields and Ames Stores During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, we opened greenfield locations in Wildwood, Florida; Cleveland, Ohio; Greenville, North Carolina; Brooklyn, New York; and Chester, Virginia. We also opened nine new Ames Taping Tools Holding LLC ("Ames") stores.

Three Months Ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 Net Sales Three Months Ended January 31, Change 2023 2022 Dollar Percent (dollars in thousands) Wallboard $ 500,710  $ 415,132  $ 85,578  20.6  % Ceilings 146,810  139,894  6,916  4.9  % Steel framing 234,451  282,764  (48,313) (17.1) % Complementary products 352,647  315,805  36,842  11.7  % Total net sales $ 1,234,618  $ 1,153,595  $ 81,023  7.0  % We generate net sales by providing a comprehensive product offering of wallboard, ceilings, steel framing and complementary products. The increase in net sales during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to inflationary pricing along with strength in multi-family residential construction activity and an improving commercial landscape, both of which helped drive volume growth in wallboard and complementary products. We also benefited from the Ames acquisition. Partially offsetting these increases was declining single-family construction demand,
30 a challenging volume and pricing environment for steel framing and the negative impact of foreign currency translation on net sales during the three months ended January 31, 2023. The increase consisted of the following: • an increase in wallboard sales, which are impacted by both commercial and residential construction activity, primarily due to an increase in price/product mix; • an increase in ceilings sales, which are principally impacted by commercial construction activity, primarily due to an increase in price/product mix, partially offset by lower volume; and • an increase in complementary products sales, which include insulation, joint treatment, tools (including automatic taping and finishing (ATF) tools), lumber and various other specialty building products, primarily due to an increase in pricing in certain product categories, positive contributions from acquisitions and the execution of growth initiatives to increase product sales; • partially offset by a decrease in steel framing sales, which are principally impacted by commercial construction activity, primarily due to a decrease in price/product mix and lower volume. The following table breaks out our net sales into organic, or base business, net sales and recently acquired net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2023. When calculating organic sales growth, we exclude the net sales of acquired businesses until the first anniversary of the acquisition date. In addition, we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation in our calculation of organic net sales growth.

For the three months ended January 31, 2023, net sales includes sales from the following acquisitions: Ames acquired on December 1, 2021, Kimco Supply Company acquired on December 1, 2021, CSSWF acquired on June 1, 2022 and Tanner acquired on December 30, 2022.
(2) Represents the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales. (3) Represents net sales of existing branches and branches that were opened by us during the period presented. The increase in organic net sales was primarily driven by inflationary pricing along with strength in multi-family residential construction activity and an improving commercial landscape, both of which helped drive volume growth in wallboard and complementary products. Partially offsetting these increases was declining single-family construction demand and a challenging volume and pricing environment for steel framing. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Three Months Ended January 31, Change 2023 2022 Dollar Percent (dollars in thousands) Gross profit $ 402,248  $ 367,772  $ 34,476  9.4  % Gross margin 32.6  % 31.9  % The increase in gross profit during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to the successful pass-through of product inflation, improving commercial wallboard sales, growth in complementary products and incremental gross profit from acquisitions. The increase in gross margin on net sales for the
31 three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in margins for complementary products and steel framing, as well as a shift in end market mix.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Three Months Ended January 31, Change 2023 2022 Dollar Percent (dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 267,380  $ 241,040  $ 26,340  10.9  % % of net sales 21.7  % 20.9  % Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of warehouse, delivery and general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increases in payroll and payroll-related costs, fuel costs, travel costs and facilities costs, which were driven by increased sales volume, inflationary pressures and incremental selling, general and administrative expenses from acquisitions. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our net sales during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to declining single-family construction demand, resulting in a relative mix shift in end market volumes, which require a higher operational cost to serve. Also contributing to the increase was higher fuel costs and unusually unfavorable weather conditions in certain markets.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense Three Months Ended January 31, Change 2023 2022 Dollar Percent (dollars in thousands) Depreciation $ 15,162  $ 13,816  $ 1,346  9.7  % Amortization 16,257  15,934  323  2.0  % Depreciation and amortization $ 31,419  $ 29,750  $ 1,669  5.6  % Depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of definite-lived intangible assets acquired in purchases of businesses. The increase in depreciation expense during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to incremental expense resulting from property and equipment obtained in the acquisition of Ames and capital expenditures over the past year. The increase in amortization expense during the three months ended January 31, 2023 was primarily due to incremental expense resulting from definite-lived intangible assets obtained in the acquisition of Ames, partially offset by time-based progression of our use of the accelerated method of amortization for acquired customer relationships. Interest Expense Three Months Ended January 31, Change 2023 2022 Dollar Percent (dollars in thousands) Interest expense $ 16,943  $ 15,429  $ 1,514  9.8  % Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense incurred on our debt and finance leases and amortization of deferred financing fees and debt discounts. The increase in interest expense during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to increases in interest rates and an increase in average debt outstanding.
32 Income Taxes Three Months Ended January 31, Change 2023 2022 Dollar Percent (dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 23,697  $ 21,211  $ 2,486  11.7  % Effective tax rate 26.8  % 25.7  % The change in the effective income tax rate during the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to the impact of actions taken during the current year in anticipation of expected changes in Canadian tax regulations, as well as state and foreign taxes. Nine Months Ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 Net Sales Nine Months Ended January 31, Change 2023 2022 Dollar Percent (dollars in thousands) Wallboard $ 1,606,821  $ 1,219,789  $ 387,032  31.7  % Ceilings 473,686  418,831  54,855  13.1  % Steel framing 787,499  751,040  36,459  4.9  % Complementary products 1,157,144  956,562  200,582  21.0  % Total net sales $ 4,025,150  $ 3,346,222  $ 678,928  20.3  % The increase in net sales during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to inflationary pricing, strength in multi-family residential construction, volume growth in wallboard and complementary products, an improving commercial landscape and acquisitions over the past year. In addition, there was one additional selling day during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period. Partially offsetting these increases was the negative impact of foreign currency translation on net sales during the nine months ended January 31, 2023. The increase consisted of the following: • an increase in wallboard sales, which are impacted by both commercial and residential construction activity, primarily due to an increase in price/product mix and higher volume; • an increase in ceilings sales, which are principally impacted by commercial construction activity, primarily due to an increase in price/product mix; • an increase in steel framing sales, which are principally impacted by commercial construction activity, primarily due to an increase in price/product mix, partially offset by lower volume; and • an increase in complementary products sales, which include insulation, joint treatment, tools (including ATF tools), lumber and various other specialty building products, primarily due to an increase in pricing in certain product categories, positive contributions from acquisitions and the execution of growth initiatives to increase product sales. 33 The following table breaks out our net sales into organic, or base business, net sales and recently acquired net sales for the nine months ended January 31, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Summary We depend on cash flow from operations, cash on hand and funds available under our asset based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Facility”) to finance working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions. We believe that these sources of funds will be adequate to fund debt service requirements and provide cash, as required, to support our growth strategies, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, lease obligations and working capital for at least the next twelve months and in the long term. We also believe we would be able to take measures to preserve liquidity should there be an economic downturn, recession or other disruption to our business in the future. As of January 31, 2023, we had available borrowing capacity of approximately $574.4 million under our ABL Facility. The ABL Facility is scheduled to mature on December 22, 2027 (or, if earlier, 91 days before the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility). On December 22, 2022, we amended and restated our ABL Facility to, among other things, increase the commitments
thereunder by $405.0 million from $545.0 million to $950.0 million and extend the maturity to December 22, 2027. Under the
terms of the amended and restated ABL Facility, we have the ability to borrow up to $200.0 million in Canadian dollars, and
35 therefore, in connection with this amendment, we have terminated our Canadian revolving credit facility. For more information regarding our ABL Facility and other indebtedness, see Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. On June 20, 2022, our Board of Directors approved an expanded share repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $200.0 million of our outstanding common stock. This expanded program replaces our previous share repurchase authorization of $75.0 million. We may conduct repurchases under the share repurchase program through open market transactions, under trading plans in accordance with SEC Rule 10b5-1 and/or in privately negotiated transactions, in each case in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing and amount of any purchases of our common stock are subject to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, our liquidity, credit availability, general business and market conditions, our debt covenants and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any amount of common stock, and it may be suspended or terminated at any time at our discretion. We repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of our common stock for $82.8 million during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, of which $10.8 million was repurchased under the previous authorization and $72.0 million was repurchased under the new authorization. As of January 31, 2023, we had $128.0 million of remaining purchase authorization.  We regularly evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure, including through the issuance or incurrence of additional debt and by refinancing or repaying existing debt, and to fund ongoing cash needs such as general corporate purposes, growth initiatives, acquisitions and our stock repurchase program. Cash Flows A summary of our operating, investing and financing activities is shown in the following table: Nine Months Ended January 31, 2023 2022 (in thousands) Cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 236,927  $ (19,887) Cash used in investing activities (52,004) (377,413) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities (98,929) 317,853  Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (1,247) (590) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 84,747  $ (80,037) Operating Activities The change in cash provided by (used in) operating activities during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to larger increases in inventory and accounts receivable
in the prior year period related to ensuring product availability and managing price inflation amid an environment of tight and less reliable supply and a large increase in sales. We have experienced increases in our inventory and accounts receivable balances compared to historical levels due to product inflation.
Investing Activities The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a $325.0 million decrease in cash used for acquisitions. Capital expenditures during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 primarily consisted of building and leasehold improvements, the purchase of vehicles and IT-related spending. Capital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and anticipated market conditions.
36 Financing Activities The change in in cash (used in) provided by financing activities during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to net borrowings of $28.9 million under our revolving credit facilities during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, compared to net borrowings of $359.2 million during the prior year period. During the nine months ended January 31, 2022, we used our revolving credit facilities to help fund the Westside acquisition and for general working capital needs. Also contributing to the change was a $64.9 million increase in repurchases of common stock during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period and a $13.5 million holdback liability payment during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 related to our Westside acquisition in accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement. The holdback was for general representations and warranties of the sellers and was settled 15 months after the July 1, 2021 acquisition date.
Debt Covenants The senior secured first lien term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) and the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes due May 2029 (the “Senior Notes”) contain a number of covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, as described in the respective credit agreement and the indenture, to incur more indebtedness; pay dividends, redeem or repurchase stock or make other distributions; make investments; create restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to us or make other intercompany transfers; create liens securing indebtedness; transfer or sell assets; merge or consolidate; enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and prepay or amend the terms of certain indebtedness. Such covenants are subject to several important exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Term Loan Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes. The Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Term Loan Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes as of January 31, 2023. The ABL Facility contains certain affirmative covenants, including financial and other reporting requirements. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of January 31, 2023. Contractual Obligations There have been no material changes to the contractual obligations as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, other than those made in the ordinary course of business. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements There have been no material changes to our off-balance sheet arrangements as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP measures. We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, we present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which are not recognized financial measures under GAAP, because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure and allocation, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments and acquisitions. In addition, we utilize Adjusted EBITDA in certain calculations under our debt agreements. Our debt agreements permit us to make certain additional adjustments in calculating Consolidated EBITDA, such as projected net cost savings, which are not reflected in the Adjusted EBITDA data presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We may in the future reflect such permitted adjustments in our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present an Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA margin measure when reporting their results. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries. 37 We also include information concerning Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. We present Adjusted EBITDA margin because it is used by management as a performance measure to judge the level of Adjusted EBITDA that is generated from net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have their limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of our net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin: Three Months Ended January 31, Nine Months Ended January 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in thousands) Net income $ 64,775  $ 61,383  $ 257,398  $ 196,946  Interest expense 16,943  15,429  47,659  43,830  Interest income (180) (40) (390) (67) Provision for income taxes 23,697  21,211  91,722  64,951  Depreciation expense 15,162  13,816  45,213  40,444  Amortization expense 16,257  15,934  50,872  46,423  Stock appreciation rights(a) 314  1,251  5,888  3,126  Redeemable noncontrolling interests and deferred compensation(b) 368  182  1,203  1,085  Equity-based compensation(c) 3,285  3,077  10,198  8,250  Severance and other permitted costs(d) (315) 273  416  669  Transaction costs (acquisitions and other)(e) 476  921  1,154  3,889  Gain on disposal of assets(f) (411) (252) (614) (474) Effects of fair value adjustments to inventory(g) 457  1,870  636  3,601  Adjusted EBITDA $ 140,828  $ 135,055  $ 511,355  $ 412,673  Net sales $ 1,234,618  $ 1,153,595  $ 4,025,150  $ 3,346,222  Adjusted EBITDA Margin 11.4  % 11.7  % 12.7  % 12.3  % ___________________________________ (a) Represents changes in the fair value of stock appreciation rights.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes to our exposure to market risks from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of January 31, 2023, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of January 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended January 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 39 PART II – Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits that are brought against us in the normal course of business. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that in management's opinion would be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. For additional information, see Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The building materials industry has been subject to personal injury and property damage claims arising from alleged exposure to raw materials contained in building products, as well as claims for incidents of catastrophic loss, such as building fires. As a distributor of building materials, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of the products we have distributed in the past or may in the future distribute is alleged to have resulted in economic loss, personal injury or property damage or to have violated environmental, health or safety or other laws. Such product liability claims have included and may in the future include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Certain of our subsidiaries have been the subject of claims related to alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products they distributed prior to 1979. Since 2002 and as of January 31, 2023, approximately 1,048 asbestos-related personal injury lawsuits have been filed, and we vigorously defend against them. Of these, 996 have been dismissed without any payment by us, 40 are pending and only 12 have been settled, which settlements have not materially impacted our financial condition or operating results. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We are exposed to product liability, warranty, casualty, construction defect, contract, tort, personal injury, employment and other claims and legal proceedings related to our business, the products we distribute, the services we provide and services provided for us by third parties” listed in Part 1, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. Item 1A. Risk Factors There have been no material changes in the risks facing the Company as described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. Item 2.

We may conduct repurchases under the share repurchase program through open market transactions, under trading plans in accordance with SEC Rule 10b5-1 and/or in privately negotiated transactions, in each case in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing and amount of any purchases of our common stock are subject to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, our liquidity, credit availability, general business and market conditions, our debt covenants and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any amount of common stock, and it may be suspended or terminated at any time at our discretion. 40 Item 3.
