ASHLAND INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE A – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial reporting and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. These statements omit certain information and footnote disclosures required for complete annual financial statements and, therefore, should be read in conjunction with the Ashland Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries (Ashland) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Results of operations for the period ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the expected results for the remaining quarters in the fiscal year.
Ashland is comprised of the following reportable segments: Life Sciences, Personal Care, Specialty Additives and Intermediates. Unallocated and Other includes corporate governance activities and certain legacy matters. For additional information, see Note Q. Use of estimates, risks and uncertainties The preparation of Ashland’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, environmental remediation, asbestos litigation, the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Ashland’s results are affected by domestic and international economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions. Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, interest and monetary exchange rates, government fiscal policies and changes in the prices of certain key raw materials, can have a significant effect on operations. While Ashland maintains reserves for anticipated liabilities and carries various levels of insurance, Ashland could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings relating to asbestos, environmental remediation or other matters. New accounting pronouncements A description of new U.S. GAAP accounting standards issued or adopted during the current year is required in interim financial reporting. A detailed listing of new accounting standards relevant to Ashland is included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 . There were no new standards that were either issued or adopted in the current fiscal year that will have a material impact on Ashland's consolidated financial statements.

NOTE B
– DIVESTITURES Performance Adhesives On February 28, 2022, Ashland completed the sale of its Performance Adhesives business to Arkema, a French société anonyme. Proceeds from the sale were approximately $ 1.7
billion, net of transaction costs. The transaction represented a strategic shift in Ashland’s business and had a major effect on Ashland’s operations and financial results. Accordingly, the operating results and cash flows related to Performance Adhesives have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Statements of Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows. See Note C for the results of operations for Performance Adhesives for all periods presented. Certain indirect corporate costs included within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) that were previously allocated to the Performance Adhesives segment do not qualify for classification within discontinued operations and are now reported as selling, general and administrative expense within continuing operations on a consolidated basis and within the Unallocated and other segment. These costs were
zero
and $ 4
million for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Other manufacturing facility sale During the three months ended December 31, 2022 , Ashland entered into a definitive sale agreement to sell a Specialty Additives manufacturing facility for less than $ 1
million.
This transaction is expected to close within the next twelve months.
The net asset value related to these sites was less than $ 1
million and $ 4
million at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, a $ 4
million impairment charge was recorded within the selling, general and administrative expense caption of the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for this manufacturing facility.
NOTE C– DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Ashland has divested certain businesses that have qualified as discontinued operations. The operating results from these divested businesses and subsequent adjustments related to ongoing assessments of certain retained liabilities and tax items have been recorded within the discontinued operations caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for all periods presented. Components of amounts reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) related to discontinued operations are presented in the following table for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021.

NOTE D – RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES Ashland periodically implements restructuring programs related to acquisitions, divestitures and other cost reduction programs in order to enhance profitability through streamlined operations and an improved overall cost structure. Fiscal 2023 Life Sciences restructuring program During December 2022, Ashland implemented a restructuring program within the Nutraceuticals business of the
Life Sciences segment. Ashland recorded severance expense of $ 1
million during the three months ended
December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022 , the severance reserve associated with this program was $ 1
million.
NOTE E – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Ashland uses applicable guidance for defining fair value, the initial recording and periodic remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value and related disclosures for instruments measured at fair value. Fair value accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument’s fair value measurement. The three levels within the fair value hierarchy are described as follows. Level 1 – Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect Ashland’s own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include Ashland’s own financial data such as internally developed pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant management judgment. For
assets that are measured using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1), the total fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs. Assets and liabilities that are measured using significant other observable inputs (Level 2) are primarily valued by reference to quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets, adjusted for any terms specific to that asset or liability. For all other assets and liabilities for which unobservable inputs are used (Level 3), fair value is derived
7
using
fair value models, such as a discounted cash flow model or other standard pricing models that Ashland deems reasonable. The following table summarizes financial instruments subject to recurring fair value measurements as of
December 31, 2022.

Restricted investments Ashland maintains certain investments in a company restricted renewable annual trusts for the purpose of paying future asbestos indemnity and defense costs and future environmental remediation and related litigation costs. The financial instruments are designated as investment securities, classified as Level 1 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. These securities were classified primarily as noncurrent restricted investment assets, with $ 61
million classified within other current assets, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. The following table presents gross unrealized gains and losses for the restricted securities as of

(a) Included in the net interest and other expense (income) caption within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Foreign currency derivatives Ashland conducts business in a variety of foreign currencies. Accordingly, Ashland regularly uses foreign currency derivative instruments to manage exposure on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies to curtail potential earnings volatility effects on certain assets and liabilities, including short-term inter-company loans, denominated in currencies other than Ashland’s functional currency of an entity. These derivative contracts generally require exchange of one foreign currency for another at a fixed rate at a future date and generally have maturities of less than twelve months. All contracts are valued at fair value with net changes in fair value recorded within the selling, general and administrative expense caption. The impacts of these contracts were largely offset by gains and losses resulting from the impact of changes in exchange rates on transactions denominated in non-functional currencies.
The following table summarizes the net gains and losses recognized during the three months ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021 within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Other financial instruments At December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 , Ashland's long-term debt (including the current portion and excluding debt issuance cost discounts) had a carrying value of $ 1,330
million and $ 1,284
million, respectively, compared to a fair value of $ 1,186
million and $ 1,102
million, respectively. The fair values of long-term debt are based on quoted market prices or, if market prices are not available, the present values of the underlying cash flows discounted at Ashland’s incremental borrowing rates. The carrying value of long-term debt with variable interest approximated fair value.
NOTE F – INVENTORIES Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are stated at cost using the weighted-average cost method. This method values inventories using average costs for raw materials and most recent production costs for labor and overhead.

Accounts Receivable Facilities and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements U.S. Accounts Receivable Sales Program Ashland continues to maintain its U.S. Accounts Receivable Sales Program entered into during fiscal 2021. Ashland accounts for the receivables transferred to buyers as sales. Ashland recognizes any gains or losses based on the excess of proceeds received net of buyer’s discounts and fees compared to the carrying value of the assets. Proceeds received, net of buyer’s discounts and fees, are recorded within the operating activities of the Statements of Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows. Losses on sale of assets, including related transaction expenses are recorded within the net interest and other expense (income) caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Ashland regularly assesses its servicing obligations and records them as assets or liabilities when appropriate. Ashland also monitors its obligation with regards to the limited guarantee and records the resulting guarantee liability when warranted. When applicable, Ashland discloses the amount of the receivable that serves as over-collateralization as a restricted asset. 12
Ashland recognized a loss of less than $ 1
million within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three months ended
December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively, within the net interest and other expense (income) caption associated with sales under the program. Ashland has recorded $ 90
million of sales at
December 31, 2022
against the buyer’s limit, which was $ 100
million at
December 31, 2022
compared to $ 110
million of sales at
September 30, 2022
against the buyer's limit, which was $ 125
million at
September 30, 2022 . Ashland transferred $ 115
million and $ 136
million in receivables to the special purpose entity (SPE) as of
December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Ashland recorded liabilities related to its service obligations and limited guarantee as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022
of less than $ 1
million. As of
December 31, 2022 , the year-to-date gross cash proceeds received for receivables transferred and derecognized was $ 49
million, of which $ 68
million was collected, which includes collections from the sales in prior year transferred to the buyer. The difference of $ 19
million represents the impact of a net reduction in accounts receivable sales volume during the current year. Foreign Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility Ashland continues to maintain its Foreign 2018 Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility. Ashland accounts for the Foreign 2018 Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility as secured borrowings, and the receivables sold pursuant to the facility are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts receivable. At December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 , the outstanding amounts of accounts receivable transferred by Ashland were $ 158
million and $ 162
million, respectively, and there were zero borrowings (denominated in multiple currencies) under the facility in both periods. Available borrowing capacity and liquidity The borrowing capacity remaining under the 2022 Credit Agreement which included the $ 600
million Revolving Credit Facility was $ 581
million due to an outstanding balance of
zero , as well as a reduction of $ 19
million for letters of credit outstanding as of
December 31, 2022. Ashland's total borrowing capacity at December 31, 2022
was $ 687
million, which included $ 106
million of available capacity from the foreign 2018 Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility. Additionally, Ashland had
zero
available liquidity under its current U.S. Accounts Receivable Sales Program as of
December 31, 2022. Covenants related to current Ashland debt agreements Ashland's debt contains usual and customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios, limitations on liens, additional subsidiary indebtedness, restrictions on subsidiary distributions, investments, mergers, sale of assets and restricted payments and other customary limitations. As of December 31, 2022, Ashland is in compliance with all debt agreement covenant restrictions. The maximum consolidated net leverage ratio permitted under Ashland's current credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement) is
4.0 . At
December 31, 2022 , Ashland’s calculation of the consolidated net leverage ratio was
1.3 . The minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio under the 2022 Credit Agreement during its entire duration is
3.0 . At
December 31, 2022 , Ashland’s calculation of the interest coverage ratio was
10.8 .

NOTE L
–
LITIGATION, CLAIMS AND CONTINGENCIES Asbestos litigation Ashland is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims result from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley Stoker Corporation (Riley) and the acquisition of Hercules in November 2008. Although Riley, a former subsidiary, was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos, its industrial boilers contained some asbestos-containing components provided by other companies. Hercules, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland, has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products sold by one of Hercules’ former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market. To assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions for Ashland and Hercules asbestos claims, Ashland retained third party actuarial experts Gnarus. The methodology used by Gnarus to project future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience, including claim-filing and settlement rates, disease mix, open claims and litigation defense. The claim experience of Ashland and Hercules are separately compared to the results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases. Those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos. Using that information, Gnarus estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed, as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims. Changes in asbestos-related liabilities and receivables are recorded on an after-tax basis within the discontinued operations caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). 15
Ashland asbestos-related litigation The claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos asserted against Ashland result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate from period to period.

Ashland asbestos-related liability From the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inflated, non-discounted approximate 40-year model developed with the assistance of Gnarus. During the most recent update completed during 2022, it was determined that the liability for Ashland asbestos-related claims should be increased by $ 16
million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were
$ 292
million at
December 31, 2022 compared to
$ 305
million at September 30, 2022. A progression of activity in the asbestos reserve is presented in the following table.

Ashland asbestos-related receivables Ashland has insurance coverage for certain litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims, and coverage-in-place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide substantially all of the coverage that will be accessed. For the Ashland asbestos-related obligations, Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management’s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. Substantially all of the estimated receivables from insurance companies are expected to be due from domestic insurers, all of which are solvent. At December 31, 2022, Ashland’s receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to
$ 99
million (excluding the Hercules receivable for asbestos claims discussed below) compared to
$ 101
million at September 30, 2022 . During fiscal year 2022, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers was completed. This model update resulted in a $ 7
million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries.

Hercules asbestos-related receivables For the Hercules asbestos-related obligations, certain reimbursement obligations pursuant to coverage-in-place agreements with insurance carriers exist. As a result, any increases in the asbestos reserve have been partially offset by probable insurance recoveries. Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management’s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. The estimated receivable consists exclusively of solvent domestic insurers. As of December 31, 2022 , Ashland’s receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claims costs from insurers with respect to Hercules amounted to $ 51
million compared to $ 52
million at
September 30, 2022 . During fiscal year 2022, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers was completed. This model update resulted in an increase of $ 7
million in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries. A progression of activity in the Hercules insurance receivable is presented in the following table.

(a) 2021 includes a $ 1
million reserve adjustment related to allowances for credit losses as a result of Ashland's adoption of the new credit measurement standard. The total allowance for credit losses was $ 1
million as of
December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. (b) Includes
$ 3
million classified in accounts receivable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 . Asbestos litigation cost projection Projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are difficult to predict. In addition to the uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received, other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant and the related costs incurred in resolving those claims, mortality rates, dismissal rates, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case. Furthermore, any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. In light of these inherent uncertainties, Ashland believes that the asbestos reserves for Ashland and Hercules represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes. As a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs, a range of long-term cost models was developed. These models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long-term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs, as well as other variables mentioned previously. Ashland has currently estimated in various models ranging from approximately
40
year periods that it is reasonably possible that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately $ 456
million for the Ashland asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of
$ 292
million) and approximately $ 317
million for the Hercules asbestos-related litigation (current reserve of
$ 209
million),
depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models. If actual experience is worse than projected, relative to the number of claims filed, the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims, or actuarial refinement or improvements to the assumptions used within these models are initiated, Ashland may need to further increase the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could be material over time. Environmental remediation and asset retirement obligations Ashland is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively environmental remediation) at multiple locations. At December 31, 2022 , such locations included
59
sites where Ashland has been identified as a potentially responsible party under Superfund or similar state laws,
109
current and former operating facilities and about
1225
service station properties, of which
17
are being actively remediated. 18
Ashland’s reserves for
environmental remediation
and related environmental litigation amounted to
$ 206
million at December 31, 2022
compared to $ 211
million at
September 30, 2022 , of which $ 157
million at
December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 was classified in other noncurrent liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining reserves were classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the environmental remediation reserves during the
three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The total reserves for environmental remediation reflect Ashland’s estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries. Engineering studies, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Ashland continues to discount certain environmental sites and regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues. Ashland has estimated the value of its probable insurance recoveries associated with its environmental reserve based on management’s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage. At
December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 , Ashland’s recorded receivable for these probable insurance recoveries was $ 20
million and $ 21
million,
of which $ 17
million at
December 31, 2022 and

and 2021 relates to divested businesses which qualified for treatment as discontinued operations for which certain environmental liabilities were retained by Ashland. These amounts are classified within the income (loss) from discontinued operations caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (loss). Environmental remediation reserves are subject to uncertainties that affect Ashland’s ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site and the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation, Ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately $ 460
million. The largest reserve for any site is
13 % of the remediation reserve. Other legal proceedings and claims In addition to the matters described above, there are other various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings pending or threatened against Ashland and its current and former subsidiaries. Such actions are with respect to commercial matters, product liability, toxic tort liability, and other environmental matters, which seek remedies or
19
damages, some of which are for substantial amounts. While Ashland cannot predict with certainty the outcome of such actions, it believes that adequate reserves have been recorded and losses already recognized with respect to such actions were immaterial as of December 31, 2022. There is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized may be incurred related to these actions; however, Ashland believes that such potential losses were immaterial as of December 31, 2022 .
NOTE M
– EARNINGS PER SHARE The following is the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations attributable to Ashland. Stock appreciation rights (SARs), stock options and warrants available to purchase shares outstanding for each reporting period whose grant price was greater than the average market price of Ashland Common Stock for each applicable period were not included in the computation of income from continuing operations per diluted share because the effect of these instruments would be antidilutive. The total number of these shares outstanding was approximately
1
million at
December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The majority of these shares are for warrants with a strike price of $ 128.66 . Earnings per share is reported under the treasury stock method.

NOTE Q – REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATION Ashland determines its reportable segments based on how operations are managed internally for the products and services sold to customers, including how the results are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, which includes determining resource allocation methodologies used for reportable segments. Operating income and EBITDA are the primary measures of performance that are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in assessing each reportable segment's financial performance. Ashland does not aggregate operating segments to arrive at these reportable segments. Reportable segment business descriptions Life Sciences is comprised of pharmaceuticals, nutrition, nutraceuticals, agricultural chemicals, diagnostic films (formerly known as advanced materials) and fine chemicals. Pharmaceutical solutions include controlled release polymers, disintegrants, film coatings, solubilizers, and tablet binders.

Products help improve desired functional outcomes through rheology modification and control, water retention, workability, adhesive strength, binding power, film formation, deposition and suspension and emulsification. Customers include global paint manufacturers, electronics and automotive manufacturers, textile mills, the construction industry, and welders. Intermediates is comprised of the production of 1,4 butanediol (BDO) and related derivatives, including n-methylpyrrolidone. These products are used as chemical intermediates in the production of engineering polymers and polyurethanes, and as specialty process solvents in a wide array of applications including electronics, pharmaceuticals, water filtration membranes and more. Butanediol is also supplied to Life Sciences, Personal Care, and Specialty Additives for use as a raw material. Unallocated and Other generally includes items such as certain significant company-wide restructuring activities, corporate governance costs and legacy costs or activities that relate to divested businesses that are no longer operated by Ashland. Reportable segment results Results of Ashland’s reportable segments are presented based on its management and internal accounting structure. The structure is specific to Ashland; therefore, the financial results of Ashland’s reportable segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies. Ashland allocates all significant costs to its reportable segments except for certain significant company-wide restructuring activities, certain corporate governance costs and other costs or activities that relate to former businesses that Ashland no longer operates. The service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefits costs is allocated to each reportable segment on a ratable basis; while the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits
23
costs are recorded within the other net periodic benefit loss caption on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Ashland refines its expense allocation methodologies to the reportable segments from time to time as internal accounting practices are improved, more refined information becomes available and the industry or market changes. Significant revisions to Ashland’s methodologies are adjusted for all segments on a retrospective basis.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS
Business results current quarter
Ashland recorded net income of $40 million (income of $42 million in continuing operations and a loss of $2 million in discontinued operations) and net income of $48 million (income of $32 million in continuing operations and $16 million in discontinued operations) in the current and prior year quarters, respectively. Ashland’s EBITDA of $93 million decreased by $25 million for the current quarter, while Ashland’s Adjusted EBITDA of $108 million
27
increased by $2 million for the current quarter, each compared to the prior year quarter (see U.S. GAAP reconciliation below under consolidated review). The increase was primarily driven by improved pricing and mix, substantially offset by increased plant, manufacturing and shipping costs, unfavorable foreign currency exchange, and lower sales volumes.
Life Sciences experienced strong global demand for pharmaceutical ingredients, while Specialty Additives and Personal Care experienced weaker demand driven primarily by the impact of COVID-19 on the China re-opening, the general economic slowdown in Europe and significant distributor destocking in China and Europe.
Additionally operating costs within Specialty Additives was impacted by planned plant maintenance shutdowns plus COVID-19 dynamics which resulted in an extended unplanned plant shutdown at the company's Nanjing, China, facility late in the quarter.
Uncertainty relating to the Ukraine and Russia conflict
Business disruptions, including those related to the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia continue to impact businesses around the globe. While it is impossible to predict the effects of the conflict such as possible escalating geopolitical tensions (including the imposition of existing and additional sanctions by the U.S and the European Union on Russia), worsening macroeconomic and general business conditions, supply chain interruptions and unfavorable energy markets, the impact could be material. Ashland is closely monitoring the situation and maintains business continuity plans that are intended to continue operations or mitigate the effects of events that could disrupt its business.
Ashland does not have manufacturing operations in Russia, Ukraine, or Belarus. Ashland sells (or previously sold) additives and specialty ingredients to manufacturers in these countries for their use in pharmaceuticals, personal care, and coatings applications. Sales to Russia and Belarus were previously limited and our products were primarily used in products and applications that are essential to the population's wellbeing and currently support our customers' humanitarian efforts. We have sales controls in place to ensure that future potential sales into the region are only to support critical pharmaceutical or personal hygiene products which are essential for the general population and in accordance with any applicable sanctions. Sales to Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus represent less than 1% of total consolidated sales and less than 1% of total consolidated assets (related to accounts receivable).
Uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic
Ashland continues to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business and geographies, including how it will impact customers, employees, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. Ashland is unable to predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on its future financial position and operating results due to numerous uncertainties. These uncertainties include the severity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, governmental, business or other actions, impacts on Ashland’s supply chain, the effect on customer demand, or changes to Ashland’s operations. The health of Ashland’s workforce and its ability to meet staffing needs throughout the critical functions cannot be predicted and is vital to operations. Further, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets, consumer spending as well as other unanticipated consequences remain unknown. In addition, Ashland cannot predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on its customers, vendors, suppliers and other business partners; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact Ashland.
Ashland continues to successfully navigate the uncertain environment associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Through the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Ashland has not experienced any additional major operating surprises related to the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to maintain supply chains in a challenging environment, had strong safety performance in the face of unprecedented pressures and improved operating discipline across each of its businesses. Ashland's businesses continued to show resiliency in the face of difficult economic circumstances. While sales were up in the quarter period-over-period, the COVID-19 impact related to the China re-opening did negatively impact demand during the current quarter for both the Specialty Additives and Personal Care business segments. Additionally Specialty Additives was also impacted by extended unplanned plant shutdowns at its Nanjing, China, facility as a result of these same dynamics. Ashland’s overall liquidity remains strong and Ashland is more than able to meet its operating cash needs and other investing and financing cash requirements at this time, including those necessary to grow the business as economic conditions improve.
28
The situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid, and Ashland is actively managing its response in collaboration with customers, government officials, team members and business partners. For further information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, please see Item 1A, Risk Factors in Ashland’s most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – CONSOLIDATED REVIEW
Consolidated review
Net income
Ashland’s net income is primarily affected by results within operating income, net interest and other expense (income), income taxes, discontinued operations and other significant events or transactions that are unusual or nonrecurring.
Key financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 included the following:
• Ashland’s net income amounted to $40 million compared to $48 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, or income of $0.73 and $0.83 diluted earnings per share, respectively.
• Discontinued operations, which are reported net of taxes, resulted in a loss of $2 million and income of $16 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
• Income from continuing operations, which excludes results from discontinued operations, amounted to income of $42 million and $32 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
• The effective income tax rates were an expense of 16% and 13% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were significantly impacted by certain tax discrete items in both the current and prior year quarters.
• Ashland incurred pretax net interest and other income of $14 million and expense of $5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This includes gains of $21 million and $4 million on restricted investments, respectively, for the current and prior year quarters.
• Other net periodic benefit income (loss) resulted in a loss of $1 million and zero during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
• Operating income was $37 million and $42 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
For further information on the items reported above, see the discussion in the comparative Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) caption review analysis.
Operating income
Operating income/loss amounted to income of $37 million and $42 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The current and prior year quarters’ operating income included certain key items that were excluded to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA
and are quantified in the table below in the “EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” section. These operating key items for the applicable periods are summarized as follows:
• Restructuring, separation and other costs – Ashland periodically implements cost reduction programs related to acquisitions, divestitures and other cost reduction programs in order to enhance profitability through streamlined operations and an improved overall cost structure. Ashland often incurs severance, facility and integration costs associated with these programs. See Note D in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the restructuring activities.
• Environmental reserve adjustments – Ashland is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts (collectively environmental remediation) at multiple locations. As a result of these activities, Ashland recorded adjustments during the current and prior year quarters to its environmental liabilities and receivables primarily related to previously divested businesses or non-operational sites. See Note L of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
29
• Asset impairments - During the three months ended December 31, 2022, Ashland incurred an impairment charge associated with the pending sale of a Specialty Additives manufacturing facility. See Note B of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 included depreciation and amortization of $59 million and $60 million, respectively.

Cost of sales for the current quarter increased $9 million compared to the prior year quarter. Price/mix and higher operating costs, which includes cost inflation associated with plant manufacturing and shipping costs (as well as planned and unplanned plant shutdowns and maintenance), increased cost of sales by $7 million and $34 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by lower volume and foreign currency exchange, which decreased cost of sales by $22 million and $10 million, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales held steady at 31.4% driven by pricing and mix improvement actions across business segments.

Ashland’s effective tax rate in any interim period is subject to adjustments related to discrete items and the mix of domestic and foreign operating results. The overall effective tax rate was 16% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and was primarily impacted by jurisdictional income mix, as well as net favorable discrete items of $1 million.
The overall effective tax rate was 13% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and was primarily impacted by jurisdictional income mix, as well as favorable discrete items of $3 million.
Adjusted income tax expense (benefit)
Key items are defined as the financial effects from significant transactions that may have caused short-term fluctuations in net income and/or operating income which Ashland believes do not accurately reflect Ashland’s
31
underlying business performance and trends. Tax specific key items are defined as the financial effects from tax specific financial transactions, tax law changes or other matters that fall within the definition of key items as previously described. The effective tax rate, excluding key items, which is a non-GAAP measure, has been prepared to illustrate the ongoing tax effects of Ashland’s operations. Management believes investors and analysts use this financial measure in assessing Ashland's business performance and that presenting this non-GAAP measure on a consolidated basis assists investors in better understanding Ashland’s ongoing business performance and enhancing their ability to compare period-to-period financial results.
The effective tax rate during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was not impacted by tax specific key items.

Total other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, for the current quarter increased $98 million compared to the prior year quarter primarily as a result of the following:
• For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the change in unrealized gain (loss) from foreign currency translation adjustments resulted in a gain of $82 million compared to a loss of $17 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The fluctuations in unrealized translation gains and losses are primarily due to translating foreign subsidiary financial statements from local currencies to U.S. Dollars.
• For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the change in commodity hedges is primarily due to the fluctuations of the market prices of the underlying commodities. Commodity hedges resulted in unrealized losses of $4 million and $3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Use of non-GAAP measures
Ashland has included within this document the following non-GAAP measures, on both a consolidated and reportable segment basis, which are not defined within U.S. GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of operating performance or cash flows:
• EBITDA – net income (loss), plus income tax expense (benefit), net interest and other expenses, and depreciation and amortization.
• Adjusted EBITDA – EBITDA adjusted for noncontrolling interests, discontinued operations, net income (loss) on acquisitions and divestitures, other income and (expense) and key items (including remeasurement gains and losses related to pension and other postretirement plans).
• Adjusted EBITDA margin – Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales.
• Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) – income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for key items, net of tax, divided by the average outstanding diluted shares for the applicable period.
• Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) excluding intangibles amortization expense – Adjusted earnings per share adjusted for intangibles amortization expense net of tax, divided by the average outstanding diluted shares for the applicable period.
• Free cash flow – operating cash flows less capital expenditures.
• Ongoing free cash flow – operating cash flows less capital expenditures and certain other adjustments as applicable.
• Ongoing free cash flow conversion – ongoing free cash flow divided by adjusted EBITDA.
Management believes the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures on a consolidated and reportable segment basis assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance by presenting comparable financial results between periods. Ashland believes that by removing the impact of depreciation and amortization and excluding certain non-cash charges, amounts spent on interest and taxes and certain other charges that are highly variable from year to year, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide Ashland’s investors with performance measures that reflect the impact to operations from trends in changes in sales, margin and operating expenses, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income and operating income. The adjustments Ashland makes to derive the non-GAAP measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude items which may cause short-term fluctuations in net income and operating income and which Ashland does not consider to be the fundamental attributes or primary drivers of its business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide disclosure on the same basis as that used by Ashland’s management to evaluate financial performance on a consolidated and reportable segment basis and provide consistency in our financial reporting, facilitate internal and external comparisons of Ashland’s historical operating performance and its business units and provide continuity to investors for comparability purposes.
The Adjusted diluted EPS metric enables Ashland to demonstrate what effect key items have on an earnings per diluted share basis by taking income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for key items after tax that have been identified in the Adjusted EBITDA table, and dividing by the average outstanding diluted shares for the applicable period. Ashland’s management believes this presentation is helpful to illustrate how the key items have impacted this metric during the applicable period.
The Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding intangibles amortization expense metric enables Ashland to demonstrate the impact of non-cash intangibles amortization expense on EPS, in addition to the key items previously mentioned.
33
Ashland’s management believes this presentation is helpful to illustrate how previous acquisitions impact applicable period results.
The free cash flow metrics enable Ashland to provide a better indication of the ongoing cash being generated that is ultimately available for both debt and equity holders as well as other investment opportunities. Unlike cash flow provided by operating activities, free cash flow and ongoing free cash flow includes the impact of capital expenditures from continuing operations and other significant items impacting cash flow, providing a more complete picture of current and future cash generation. Free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect adjustment for certain non-discretionary cash flows such as mandatory debt repayments. The amount of mandatory versus discretionary expenditures can vary significantly between periods.
Although Ashland may provide forward-looking guidance for Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted EPS and ongoing free cash flow, Ashland is not reaffirming or providing forward-looking guidance for U.S. GAAP-reported financial measures or a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items that affect these metrics such as domestic and international economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions. In addition, certain economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, interest and monetary exchange rates, government fiscal policies and changes in the prices of certain key raw materials, can have a significant effect on operations and are difficult to predict with certainty.
These non-GAAP measures should be considered supplemental in nature and should not be construed as more significant than comparable measures defined by U.S. GAAP. Limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures include that these measures do not present all of the amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP measures provided are used by Ashland management and may not be determined in a manner consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide a supplemental presentation of Ashland’s operating performance on a consolidated and reportable segment basis. Adjusted EBITDA generally includes adjustments for items that impact comparability between periods. In addition, certain financial covenants related to Ashland’s 2022 Credit Agreement are based on similar non-GAAP measures and are defined further in the sections that reference this metric.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA totaled income of $93 million and $118 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA results in the table below have been prepared to illustrate the ongoing effects of Ashland’s operations, which exclude certain key items previously described. Management believes the use of such non-GAAP measures on a consolidated and reportable segment basis assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance by presenting the financial results between periods on a more comparable basis.

Diluted EPS and Adjusted Diluted EPS
The following table reflects the U.S. GAAP calculation for the income from continuing operations adjusted for the cumulative diluted EPS effect for key items after tax that have been identified in the Adjusted EBITDA table in the previous section. Key items are defined as the financial effects from significant transactions that may have caused short-term fluctuations in net income and/or operating income which Ashland believes do not accurately reflect Ashland’s underlying business performance and trends. The Adjusted diluted EPS for the income from continuing operations in the following table has been prepared to illustrate the ongoing effects of Ashland’s operations. Management believes investors and analysts use this financial measure in assessing Ashland's business performance and that presenting this non-GAAP measure on a consolidated basis assists investors in better understanding Ashland’s ongoing business performance and enhances their ability to compare period-to-period financial results.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – REPORTABLE SEGMENT REVIEW
Ashland’s reportable segments include Life Sciences, Personal Care, Specialty Additives, and Intermediates. Unallocated and Other includes corporate governance activities and certain legacy matters.
Results of Ashland’s reportable segments are presented based on its management and internal accounting structure. The structure is specific to Ashland; therefore, the financial results of Ashland’s reportable segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other companies. Ashland allocates all significant costs to its reportable segments except for certain significant company-wide restructuring activities, certain corporate governance costs and other costs or activities that relate to former businesses that Ashland no longer operates. The service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefits costs is allocated to each reportable segment on a ratable basis; while the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits costs are recorded within the other net periodic benefit loss caption on the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss). Ashland refines its expense allocation methodologies to the reportable segments from time to time as
35
internal accounting practices are improved, more refined information becomes available and the industry or market changes. Significant revisions to Ashland’s methodologies are adjusted for all segments on a retrospective basis.
The following table discloses sales, operating income, depreciation and amortization and EBITDA by reportable segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation
The EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA amounts presented within this business section are provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for each segment. Each of these non-GAAP measures is defined as follows: EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation and amortization), Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for key items, which may include pro forma effects for significant acquisitions or divestitures, as applicable), and Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA, which may include pro forma adjustments, divided by sales or sales adjusted for pro forma results). Ashland does not allocate items to each reportable segment below operating income, such as interest expense and income taxes. As a result, reportable segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are reconciled directly to operating income since it is the most directly comparable Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income (Loss) caption.
The following EBITDA presentation for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for the results of Life Sciences. The key items during the three months ended December 31, 2022 related to $1 million for restructuring program within the Nutraceuticals business of the Life Sciences segment.

December 2022 quarter compared to December 2021 quarter
Unallocated and other recorded expense of $29 million and $27 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The current and prior year quarters included expense of $1 million and $5 million, respectively, for restructuring activities mainly comprised of severance, lease abandonment and other restructuring costs related to company-wide cost reduction programs during the current and prior year quarters, respectively, which included stranded costs of $4 million for prior year quarter associated with the Performance Adhesives divestiture.
The current quarter and prior year quarter included $8 million and $3 million for environmental expenses, respectively.
Other expenses between periods were driven by increases in governance and legacy expenses primarily associated with fluctuations in foreign currency, deferred compensation and stock compensation.
FINANCIAL POSITION
Liquidity
Ashland believes that cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and the ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for Ashland’s foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, dividend payments and debt service obligations. Ashland’s cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements.

Cash flows
Ashland’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows, are summarized as follows for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Cash and cash equivalents decreased $114 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to a $16 million decrease for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The $114 million decrease for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by payment of cash dividends, additions to property, plant and equipment, and taxes paid on stock based compensation of $18 million, $23 million and $9 million, respectively. Operating cash flows from continuing operations were outflows of $29 million, while discontinued operations cash flows were outflows of $34 million.
The $16 million decrease for the three months ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by payment of cash dividends of $17 million and additions to property, plant and equipment of $15 million offset by net proceeds from short-term debt of $11 million. Operating cash flows from continuing operations were inflows of $14 million, while discontinued operations cash flows were outflows of $9 million.

Working capital (current assets minus current liabilities, excluding long-term debt due within one year) amounted to $1,260 million and $1,215 million as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The $45 million increase in working capital was the primary reason of the $47 million decline in ongoing free cash flows between periods primarily as a result of increased inventories to navigate supply-chain issues as well as cost
41
inflation and reduced accrued expenses as a result of annual incentive program payouts, which were $24 million higher than the prior year's quarter. Liquid assets (cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable) amounted to 190% of current liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.

The borrowing capacity remaining under the $600 million revolving credit facility was $581 million due to an outstanding balance of zero, as well as a reduction of $19 million for letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2022. In total, Ashland’s available liquidity position, which includes cash, the revolving credit facility and foreign accounts receivable securitization facility, was $1,219 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $1,326 million at September 30, 2022. Ashland had no available liquidity under the U.S. Accounts Receivable Sales Program as of December 31, 2022. Ashland also maintained $404 million of restricted investments to pay for future asbestos claims and environmental remediation and related litigation.

Debt as a percent of capital employed was 28% at December 31, 2022 and at September 30, 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2022, Ashland’s total debt had an outstanding principal balance of $1,366 million, discounts of $36 million, and debt issuance costs of $14 million. Ashland had no long-term debt (excluding debt issuance costs) maturing within the next 4 years and $4 million due in fiscal 2027.
Ashland credit ratings
Ashland’s corporate credit ratings remained unchanged at BB+ by Standard & Poor’s and Ba1 by Moody’s Investor Services. As of December 31, 2022, both Moody’s Investor Services and Standard & Poor's outlook remained at stable. Subsequent changes to these ratings or outlook may have an effect on Ashland’s borrowing rate or ability to access capital markets in the future.
Ashland debt covenant restrictions
Ashland's current credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement) contains usual and customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios, limitations on liens, additional subsidiary indebtedness, restrictions on subsidiary distributions, investments,
42
mergers, sale of assets and restricted payments and other customary limitations. As of December 31, 2022, Ashland is in compliance with all debt agreement covenant restrictions under the 2022 Credit Agreement.
The maximum consolidated net leverage ratio permitted under the 2022 Credit Agreement is 4.0. The 2022 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated net leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to consolidated EBITDA (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA) for any measurement period. In general, the 2022 Credit Agreement defines Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus consolidated interest charges, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, fees and expenses related to capital market transactions and proposed or actual acquisitions and divestitures, restructuring and integration charges, noncash stock and equity compensation expense, and any other nonrecurring expenses or losses that do not represent a cash item in such period or any future period; less any noncash gains or other items increasing net income. The computation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA differs from the calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which have been reconciled above in the “consolidated review” section. In general, consolidated indebtedness includes debt plus all purchase money indebtedness, banker’s acceptances and bank guaranties, deferred purchase price of property or services, attributable indebtedness and guarantees. At December 31, 2022, Ashland’s calculation of the consolidated net leverage ratio was 1.3.
The minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio under the 2022 Credit Agreement is 3.0. The 2022 Credit Agreement defines the consolidated interest coverage ratio as the ratio of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest charges for any measurement period. At December 31, 2022, Ashland’s calculation of the consolidated interest coverage ratio was 10.8.
Any change in Covenant Adjusted EBITDA of $100 million would have an approximate 0.2x effect on the consolidated net leverage ratio and a 1.8x effect on the consolidated interest coverage ratio. The change in consolidated indebtedness of $100 million would affect the consolidated leverage ratio by approximately 0.2x.
Additional capital resources
Total equity
Total equity increased by $98 million since September 30, 2022 to $3,318 million at December 31, 2022. The increase of $98 million was due to net income of $40 million and deferred translation gain of $82, offset by dividends of $18 million, common shares issued under stock incentive plans of $2 million and $4 million of deferred loss on commodity hedges.
Stockholder dividends
Ashland paid a dividend of 33.5 cents per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 30.0 cents per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Capital
expenditures
Capital expenditures were $23 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $15 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of Ashland’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, long-lived assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets), income taxes, other liabilities and receivables associated with asbestos litigation and environmental remediation. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Critical Accounting Policies” in Ashland’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management has reviewed the estimates affecting these items with the Audit Committee of Ashland’s Board of Directors. No material changes have been made to the valuation techniques during the three months ended December 31, 2022.
43
OUTLOOK
Ashland issued its outlook for fiscal 2023 in November 2022. This outlook has not changed and remains the same as shown in the table below. Ashland continues to expect sales in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, consistent with prior expectations. In addition, the company continues to expect Adjusted EBITDA to be within the prior outlook range of $600 million to $650 million, with the current forecast model indicating earnings below the mid-point of that range.
FY2023 Outlook
Key Operating Metrics
Sales
$2.5 - $2.7 billion
Adjusted EBITDA
$600 - $650 million
Ashland is unable to reconcile forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to forward-looking net income, the most closely comparable GAAP financial measure, because the information needed to provide such reconciliation would require unreasonable efforts.
44
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Ashland’s market risk exposure at December 31, 2022 is generally consistent with the types of market risk exposures presented in Ashland’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
- As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, Ashland, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including Ashland’s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of Ashland’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
- During the three months ended December 31, 2022, there were no significant changes in Ashland's internal control over financial reporting, or in other factors, that occurred during the period covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Ashland's internal control over financial reporting.
45
PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The following is a description of Ashland’s material legal proceedings.
Ashland’s threshold for disclosing material environmental legal proceedings involving a governmental authority where potential monetary sanctions are involved is $1 million.
Asbestos-Related Litigation
Ashland is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley Stoker Corporation (Riley), a former subsidiary. Although Riley was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos, its industrial boilers contained some asbestos-containing components provided by other companies.
Hercules LLC (formerly Hercules Incorporated), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ashland, is also subject to liabilities from asbestos-related personal injury lawsuits involving claims which typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of Hercules’ former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market.
Ashland and Hercules are also defendants in lawsuits alleging exposure to asbestos at facilities formerly or presently owned or operated by Ashland or Hercules.
For additional detailed information regarding liabilities arising from asbestos-related litigation, see Note L of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
Environmental Proceedings
(a) CERCLA and Similar State Law Sites -
Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state laws, Ashland and its subsidiaries may be subject to joint and several liability for cleanup costs in connection with alleged releases of hazardous substances at sites where it has been identified as a “potentially responsible party” (PRP). As of December 31, 2022, Ashland and its subsidiaries have been identified as a PRP by U.S. federal and state authorities, or by private parties seeking contribution, for the cost of environmental investigation and/or cleanup at 59 sites. These sites are currently subject to ongoing investigation and remedial activities, overseen by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) or a state agency, in which Ashland or its subsidiaries are typically participating as a member of a PRP group. Generally, the types of relief sought include remediation of contaminated soil and/or groundwater, reimbursement for past costs of site cleanup and administrative oversight and/or long-term monitoring of environmental conditions at the sites. The ultimate costs are not predictable with assurance.
(b) Lower Passaic River, New Jersey Matters -
Ashland, through two formerly owned facilities, and International Specialty Products (ISP), through a now-closed facility, have been identified as PRPs, along with approximately 70 other companies (the Cooperating Parties Group or the CPG), in a May 2007 Administrative Order of Consent (AOOC) with the USEPA. The parties are required to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) of the entire 17 miles of the Passaic River. In June 2007, the USEPA separately commenced a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) as an interim measure. In accordance with the 2007 AOOC, in June 2012 the CPG voluntarily entered into another AOOC for an interim removal action focused solely at mile 10.9 of the Passaic River. The allocations for the 2007 AOOC and the 2012 removal action are based on interim allocations, are immaterial and have been accrued. In April 2014, the USEPA released the FFS. The CPG submitted the Draft RI/FS Report on April 30, 2015. The USEPA has released the FFS Record of Decision for the lower 8 miles and reached an agreement with another chemical company to conduct and pay for the remedial design. This chemical company has sued Ashland, ISP and numerous other defendants to recover past and future costs pursuant to the CERCLA. Ashland's motion to dismiss was partially granted, and the surviving claims are in the early stages of recovery. Ashland and ISP participated in an USEPA allocation process that resulted in a partial settlement with the EPA. Possible future allocation proceedings and the lawsuit are not expected to be material to Ashland.
For additional information regarding environmental matters and reserves, see Note L of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
46
Other Pending Legal Proceedings
In addition to the matters described above, there are other various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings pending or threatened against Ashland and its current and former subsidiaries. Such actions are with respect to commercial matters, product liability, toxic tort liability and other environmental matters which seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts. While Ashland cannot predict with certainty the outcome of such actions, it believes that adequate reserves have been recorded and losses already recognized with respect to such actions were immaterial as of December 31, 2022. There is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized may be incurred related to these actions; however, Ashland believes that such potential losses were immaterial as of December 31, 2022.
