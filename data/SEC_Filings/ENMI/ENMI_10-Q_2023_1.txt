CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are not historical facts, and involve risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected. All statements, other than statements
of historical facts, included in this Form 10-Q including, without limitation, statements in the “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” regarding the Company’s financial position, business strategy
and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, events or developments which the Company expects or anticipates will
or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof); expansion
and growth of the Company’s business and operations; and other such matters are forward-looking statements. These statements are
based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current
conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. However, whether
actual results or developments will conform with the Company’s expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties, including general economic, market and business conditions; the business opportunities (or lack thereof) that may be presented
to and pursued by the Company; changes in laws or regulation; and other factors, most of which are beyond the control of the Company.
These forward-looking statements
can be identified by the use of predictive, future-tense or forward-looking terminology, such as “believes,” “anticipates,”
“expects,” “estimates,” “plans,” “may,” “will,” or similar terms. These statements
appear in a number of places in this filing and include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company,
and its directors or its officers with respect to, among other things: (i) trends affecting the Company’s financial condition or
results of operations for its limited history; (ii) the Company’s business and growth strategies; and, (iii) the Company’s
financing plans. Investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve
significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements
as a result of various factors. Such factors that could adversely affect actual results and performance include, but are not limited to,
the Company’s limited operating history, potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results and expenses, government regulation,
technological change and competition. For information identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, please refer to our filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act and the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, including the Risk Factors section of Amendment No. 4 of the Registration Statement on Form 10 filed with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 17, 2022.
Consequently, all of the forward-looking
statements made in this Form 10-Q are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or
developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequence
to or effects on the Company or its business or operations. The Company assumes no obligations to update any such forward-looking statements.

2.        SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and notes.
• Basis of presentation
These accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“US
GAAP”).
• Use of estimates and assumptions
In preparing these unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance
sheet and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
8
• Basis of consolidation
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of ENMI and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company
have been eliminated upon consolidation.
• Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost
and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.
• Revenue recognition
ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(“ASC 606”), establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts to provide goods or services to customers.
The Company applies the following five steps in
order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:
•
identify the contract with a customer;
•
identify the performance obligations in the contract;
•
determine the transaction price;
•
allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and
•
recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company derives its revenue from the sale
of the rapid tester kits. The Company sells its products directly to healthcare providers, retailers and individual consumers through
its retail channels. The Company considers customer order confirmations to be a contract with the customer. Customer confirmations are
executed at the time an order is placed. Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when
the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs at shipment date. As a result, the Company has a present
and unconditional right to payment and record the amount due from the customer in accounts receivable.
For each contract, the Company considers the promise
to transfer products to be the only identified performance obligation. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether
the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. The Company’s
revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are recognized at a point in time.
• Cost of revenue
Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost
of goods sold, which are directly attributable to the sales of products.
• Income taxes
The Company adopted the ASC 740
Income tax
provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a
tax return should be recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Under paragraph 740-10-25-13, the Company
may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained
on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than
fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition,
classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company
had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13.
9
The estimated future tax effects of temporary
differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs
and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides
valuation allowances as management deems necessary.
• Uncertain tax positions
The Company did
no t take any uncertain tax positions
and had no adjustments to its income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the ASC 740 provisions of Section 740-10-25 for the nine
months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
• Foreign currencies translation
Transactions denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency
using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the unaudited condensed
consolidated statement of operations.
The reporting currency of the Company is United
States Dollar ("US$") and the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been expressed in US$.
In addition, the Company is operating in Hong Kong and maintain its books and record in its local currency, Hong Kong Dollars (“HKD”),
which is a functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which their operations are conducted. In general,
for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiary whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in
accordance with ASC 830-30, “
Translation of Financial Statement ”, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of
financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statements
of changes in stockholder’s equity.
Translation of amounts from HKD into US$ has
been made at the following exchange rates for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:
Schedule of translation rates
December 31, 2022
December 31, 2021
Period-end HKD:US$ exchange rate
0.1282
0.1282
Period average HKD:US$ exchange rate
0.1276
0.1286
• Comprehensive income
ASC Topic 220,
Comprehensive Income , establishes
standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income as defined
includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented in the accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses
on foreign currency translation. This comprehensive income is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit.
• Net loss per share
The Company calculates net loss per share in accordance
with ASC 260,
Earnings per Share . Basic income per share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed similar to basic income per share except that the
denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock
equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.
10
• Stock based compensation
Pursuant to ASU 2018-07, the Company follows ASC
718,
Compensation—Stock Compensation
(“ASC 718”), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
expense for all share-based payment awards (employee or non-employee), are measured at grant-date fair value of the equity instruments
that an entity is obligated to issue. Restricted stock units are valued using the market price of the Company’s common shares on
the date of grant. The Company uses a Black-Scholes option model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options at the date of grant.
As of December 31, 2022, those shares issued and stock options granted for service compensations were immediately vested, and therefore
these amounts are thus recognized as expense in the operation.
• Related parties
The Company follows the ASC 850-10,
Related
Party
for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.
Pursuant to section 850-10-20 the related parties
include a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the
election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of section 825–10–15, to be accounted for by the
equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and Income-sharing trusts that are managed
by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e) management of the Company; f) other parties with which
the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent
that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g) other parties that
can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one
of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be
prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances,
and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation
of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a) the nature
of the relationship(s) involved; b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were
ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding
of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for
which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding
period; and d) amount due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent,
the terms and manner of settlement.
• Commitments and contingencies
The Company follows the ASC 450-20,
Commitments
to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result
in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such
contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal
proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the
perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected
to be sought therein.
If the assessment of a contingency indicates that
it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would
be accrued in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially
material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent
liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.
11
Loss contingencies considered remote are generally
not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon
information available at this time that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company’s
business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.
• Fair value of financial instruments
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted paragraph 820-10-35-37
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments.
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair
value measurements and related disclosures, paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a fair value
hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value
hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification are described below:
Level 1
Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2
Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3
Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their
fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant
model assumption or input is unobservable.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If
the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.
The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial
assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.
• Recent accounting pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements
are issued by the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies and adopted by the Company
as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that
are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
The Company has reviewed all recently issued,
but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to
cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

3.        GOING
CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared using going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the
Company incurred a net loss of $ 330,059
and suffered from a working capital deficit of $ 766,908
as of December 31, 2022. The Company has
not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern.
The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its stockholders. Management
believes the existing stockholders will provide the additional cash to meet with the Company’s obligations as they become due. However,
there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain the operations.
These and other factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result
in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

shares of the Company’s
common stock, which will be issued upon the completion of the agreements. The fair value of 19,684,019 shares was $ 452,732 , which was
measured based on the stock price of $ 0.023
per share on January 3, 2022 and is being amortized over the service terms. The shares were
issued pursuant to S-8 registration statement. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company charged $ 226,366

things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Company’s policy is to recognize
accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its income tax provision. The Company has not accrued or paid
interest or penalties which were not material to its results of operations for the periods presented. At December 31, 2022, the

Item 2.   Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
DH Enchantment, Inc. is a
Nevada holding company with no operations of its own. DH Enchantment, Inc. conducts its operations through its Hong Kong subsidiary, Ho
Shun Yi Limited (“HSY”). HSY was organized as a private limited liability company on July 9, 2018, in Hong Kong and is a wholly
owned subsidiary of DH Investment Group Limited (“DHIG”). We acquired DHIG on July 26, 2021. HSY is engaged primarily in the
sale and distribution of COVID-19 rapid antigen tester sets produced by third parties. HSY commenced operations in Hong Kong in October
2020 and sell its products primarily in Hong Kong.
Our investors will hold common
stock of DH Enchantment, Inc., the Nevada holding company that has no operations of its own, and not in HSY, the Hong Kong operating company.
This holding company structure presents unique risks as our investors may never directly hold equity interests in our Hong Kong subsidiary.
Holding indirect equity interests in HSY, our Hong Kong subsidiary, is not as effective as holding a direct ownership interest as DH Enchantment,
Inc. will be dependent upon contributions from our subsidiaries to finance the cash flow needs of DH Enchantment, Inc. DH Enchantment,
Inc.’s ability to obtain contributions from its subsidiaries are significantly affected by regulations promulgated by Hong Kong
authorities. Any limitation on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer cash or assets to us could have a material adverse effect on
our ability to conduct business. As a result, any change in the interpretation of existing rules and regulations or the promulgation of
new rules and regulations that adversely affects our ability to transfer cash or assets may adversely affect our operations and or the
value of our securities, including causing the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For a detailed description
of the risks facing the Company associated with our structure, please refer to “ Risk Factors- Our Hong Kong subsidiary may
be subject to restrictions on paying dividends or making other payments to us, which may restrict its ability to satisfy liquidity requirements,
conduct business and pay dividends to holders of DH Enchantment, Inc.’s common stock.” and more generally,
“Risk
Factors – Risk Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong. ” set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed
with the SEC on June 29, 2022 (the “Annual Report”).
DH Enchantment, Inc. and HSY,
our Hong Kong subsidiary, are not required to obtain permission from Hong Kong or Chinese authorities including the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, or CSRC, or Cybersecurity Administration Committee, or CAC, to operate or to issue securities to foreign investors. In making
this determination, we relied on the opinion of Ravenscroft & Schmierer, which is attached as Exhibit 5 to Amendment No. 6 to the
Registration Statement on Form 10 filed with the SEC on June 27, 2022. DH Enchantment, Inc. and HSY are not subject to permission requirements
from any other governmental agencies to approve HSY’s operations. HSY has received all requisite permissions to operate its business.
The business of HSY until now is not subject to cybersecurity review with the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, given that:
(i) HSY’s products and services are offered not directly to individual users but through institutional customers; (ii) HSY does
not possess a large amount of personal information in its business operations. In addition, we believe that HSY is not subject to merger
control review by China’s anti-monopoly enforcement agency due to the level of our revenues and the fact that we currently do not
expect to propose or implement any acquisition of control of, or decisive influence over, any company with revenues within China of more
than RMB400 million. Currently, these statements and regulatory actions have had no impact on HSY’s daily business operation, our
ability to accept foreign investments and the ability of DH Enchantment, Inc. to list its securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange.
However, in light of the recent statements and regulatory actions by the PRC and Hong Kong government, such as those related to Hong Kong’s
national security, the promulgation of regulations prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies operating in certain industries,
which are constantly evolving, and anti-monopoly concerns, we may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the
PRC government in this regard. For example, if DH Enchantment, Inc. or HSY inadvertently concludes that such approvals are not required,
or if applicable laws, regulations or interpretations change such that we are required to obtain approvals in the future, or if the PRC
government disallows our holding company structure, these actions would likely result in a material change in our operations, including
our ability to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on HSY’s current business, accept foreign investments, and
offer or continue to offer securities of DH Enchantment, Inc. to its investors. These adverse actions would likely cause the value of
DH Enchantment, Inc.’s common stock to significantly decline or become worthless. We may also be subject to penalties and sanctions
imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission, if we fail to comply with such rules and
regulations, which would likely adversely affect the ability of DH Enchantment, Inc.’s securities to continue to trade on the Over-the-Counter
Bulletin Board, which would likely cause the value of its securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For a detailed description
of the risks facing the Company and HSY’s operations in Hong Kong, please refer to “ Risk Factors – Risk Factors
Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong. ” set forth in the Annual Report.
18
There are prominent
legal and operational risks associated with our operations being based in Hong Kong which could result in a material change in our operations
and the value of DH Enchantment, Inc.’s securities.
We are subject to risks arising from the legal system in China where
there are risks and uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws including where the Chinese government can change the rules and regulations
in China and Hong Kong, including the enforcement and interpretation thereof, at any time with little to no advance notice and can intervene
at any time with little to no advance notice. By way of example, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements
to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market,
enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend
the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. While these regulatory actions and statements
currently do not impact our business or our ability to accept foreign investments or list our securities on a U.S. or foreign exchange,
the Chinese government can change its rules and regulations and the enforcement and interpretation thereof with little to no advance notice.
Such changes in Chinese internal regulatory mandates, such as the M&A rules, Anti-Monopoly Law, and the Data Security Law, may target
the Company's corporate structure and negatively impact our ability to conduct business in Hong Kong, accept foreign investments, or list
on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. These risks may significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer
securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Please see “Risk Factors
— Risks Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong.” set forth in the Annual Report.
The recent joint statement
by the SEC and PCAOB, and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA) all call for additional and more stringent criteria to
be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not
inspected by the PCAOB. Trading in our securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and the Accelerating
the Holding Foreign Companies Account Act if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or investigate completely our auditor, and that
as a result an exchange may determine to delist our securities. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign
Companies Accountable Act which would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under
the HFCAA from three years to two thus reducing the time before our securities may be prohibited from trading or being delisted. Our auditor
is not subject to the determinations announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. However, in the event the Malaysian authorities subsequently
take a position disallowing the PCAOB to inspect our auditor, then we would need to change our auditor to avoid having our securities
delisted. Please see “ Risk Factors- The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act requires the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (PCAOB) to be permitted to inspect the issuer's public accounting firm within three years. This three- year period will be shortened
to two years if the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act is enacted. There are uncertainties under the PRC Securities
Law relating to the procedures and requisite timing for the U.S. securities regulatory agencies to conduct investigations and collect
evidence within the territory of the PRC. If the U.S. securities regulatory agencies are unable to conduct such investigations, they may
suspend or de-register DH Enchantment, Inc.’s registration with the SEC and delist its securities from applicable trading market
within the US. ”  set forth in the Annual Report.
In addition to the foregoing
risks, we face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties arising from doing business in Hong Kong and China as summarized
below and in “ Risk Factors — Risks Factors Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong. ” set forth in the Annual
Report.
☐
Adverse changes in economic and political policies of the PRC government could have a material and adverse effect on overall economic growth in China and Hong Kong, which could materially and adversely affect our business.
☐
DH Enchantment, Inc .
is a holding company and will rely on dividends paid by its subsidiaries for its cash needs. Any limitation on the ability of its subsidiaries to make payments to DH Enchantment, Inc. could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business. We do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future; you should not buy stock of DH Enchantment, Inc. if you expect dividends.
19
☐
There is a possibility that the PRC could prevent our cash maintained in Hong Kong from leaving or the PRC could restrict the deployment of the cash into our business or for the payment of dividends. We rely on dividends from our Hong Kong subsidiary for our cash and financing requirements, such as the funds necessary to service any debt we may incur. Any such controls or restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance our cash requirements, service debt or make dividend or other distributions to our shareholders. Please see “ Risk Factors - Our Hong Kong subsidiary may be subject to restrictions on paying dividends or making other payments to us, which may restrict its ability to satisfy liquidity requirements, conduct business and pay dividends to holders of DH Enchantment, Inc.’s common stock.”; “Risk Factors - PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds we receive from offshore financing activities to make loans to or make additional capital contributions to our Hong Kong subsidiary, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand business.”; “Risk Factors - Because our holding company structure creates restrictions on the payment of dividends or other cash payments, our ability to pay dividends or make other payments is limited.” and “Transfers of Cash to and from our Subsidiaries. ” set forth in the Annual Report.
☐
PRC regulation of loans to and direct investments in PRC entities by offshore holding companies may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of this offering to make loans or additional capital contributions to DH Enchantment, Inc.’s operating subsidiary in Hong Kong.
☐
Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of the PRC Foreign Investment Law and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations.
☐
We are subject to the risks arising from the legal system in China. The Chinese government can change the rules and regulations in China and Hong Kong, including the enforcement and interpretation thereof, at any time with little to no advance notice and can intervene at any time with little to no advance notice. HSY is currently not required to obtain approval from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges. However, if the subsidiaries of DH Enchantment, Inc. or the holding company were required to obtain approval in the future, or we erroneously conclude that approvals were not required, or HSY was denied permission from Chinese authorities to operate or to list on U.S. exchanges, we will not be able to continue listing on a U.S. exchange and the value of DH Enchantment, Inc. common stock would likely significantly decline or become worthless, which would materially affect the interest of the investors. There is a risk that the Chinese government may intervene or influence HSY’s operations at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in Hong Kong-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of DH Enchantment, Inc.’s securities. Further, any actions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers would likely significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer DH Enchantment, Inc. securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Please see “ Risk Factors-We face the risk that changes in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the Hong Kong and the profitability of such business .” and “ Substantial uncertainties and restrictions with respect to the political and economic policies of the PRC government and PRC laws and regulations could have a significant impact upon the business that we may be able to conduct in Hong Kong and accordingly on the results of our operations and financial condition .” set forth in the Annual Report.
☐
Governmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment.
☐
HSY may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the PRC regarding privacy, data security, cybersecurity, and data protection. HSY may be liable for improper use or appropriation of personal information provided by our customers.
☐
Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a “Resident Enterprise” of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.
☐
PRC regulation of loans to, and direct investments in, Hong Kong entities by offshore holding companies may delay or prevent us from using proceeds from this offering and/or future financing activities to make loans or additional capital contributions to our Hong Kong operating subsidiary.
☐
Failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident Shareholders to personal liability, may limit our ability to acquire Hong Kong and PRC companies or to inject capital into our Hong Kong subsidiary, may limit the ability of our Hong Kong subsidiary to distribute profits to us or may otherwise materially and adversely affect us.

☐
The recent joint statement by the SEC and PCAOB, and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA) all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not inspected by the PCAOB. Trading in our securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or investigate completely our auditor, and that as a result an exchange may determine to delist our securities. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act which would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCAA from three years to two thus reducing the time before our securities may be prohibited from trading or being delisted. On December 2, 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules to implement the HFCAA. Pursuant to the HFCAA, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued its report notifying the Commission that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely accounting firms headquartered in mainland China or Hong Kong due to positions taken by authorities in mainland China and Hong Kong. Our auditor is not subject to the determinations announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. However, in the event the Malaysian authorities subsequently take a position disallowing the PCAOB to inspect our auditor, then we would need to change our auditor to avoid having our securities delisted. Please see “ Risk Factors- The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act requires the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to be permitted to inspect the issuer's public accounting firm within three years.

There are uncertainties under the PRC Securities Law relating to the procedures and requisite timing for the U.S. securities regulatory agencies to conduct investigations and collect evidence within the territory of the PRC. If the U.S. securities regulatory agencies are unable to conduct such investigations, they may suspend or de-register DH Enchantment, Inc.’s registration with the SEC and delist its securities from applicable trading market within the US. ” set forth in the Annual Report.
☐
You may be subject to PRC income tax on dividends from us or on any gain realized on the transfer of shares of our common stock.
☐
We face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies.
☐
DH Enchantment, Inc. is organized under the laws of the State of Nevada as a holding company that conducts its business through a number of subsidiaries organized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands. This may have an adverse impact on the ability of U.S. investors to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. Courts against these entities, bring actions in Hong Kong against us or our management or to effect service of process on the officers and directors managing the foreign subsidiaries.
☐
U.S. regulatory bodies may be limited in their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in Hong Kong.
☐
There are significant uncertainties under the EIT Law relating to the withholding tax liabilities of PRC subsidiary, and dividends payable by a PRC subsidiary to offshore subsidiaries may not qualify to enjoy certain treaty benefits.

all available funds and future earnings, if any, for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying
any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination related to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our
board of directors after considering our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual requirements, business
prospects and other factors the board of directors deems relevant, and subject to the restrictions contained in any future financing instruments.
21
DH Enchantment, Inc. (Nevada
corporation)
Subject to the Nevada Revised
Statutes and our bylaws, the board of directors of DH Enchantment, Inc. may authorize and declare a dividend to shareholders at such time
and of such an amount as they think fit if they are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that immediately following the dividend the value
of the assets of DH Enchantment, Inc. will exceed its liabilities and it will be able to pay its debts as they become due. There is no
further Nevada statutory restriction on the amount of funds which may be distributed by DH Enchantment, Inc.by dividend to its U.S. investors.
DH Enchantment, Inc. is permitted under the Nevada laws to provide funding to its subsidiary in Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands
through loans or capital contributions without restrictions on the amount of the funds.
DH Investment Group Limited
(British Virgin Islands)
DH Investment Group Limited
is permitted under the laws of BVI to provide funding to and receive funding from DH Enchantment, Inc. and Ho Shun Yi Limited through
dividend distributions or other payments of cash without restrictions on the amount of the funds.  There are no BVI law restrictions
on DH Investment Group’s ability to receive and provide funding from DH Enchantment Inc. and Ho Shun Yi Limited.
Ho Shun Yi Limited (Hong
Kong)
Ho Shun Yi Limited is permitted
under the laws of Hong Kong to provide funding to and receive funding from DH Enchantment, Inc. and DH Investment Group Limited through
dividend distributions or other payments of cash without restrictions on the amount of the funds.  If DH Enchantment, Inc.’s
Hong Kong subsidiary incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends
or make other distributions to us. There are no HK law restrictions on HSY’s ability to transfer cash to or receive cash from the
BVI or Nevada entity in the event HSY incurs debt.
Under the current practice
of the Inland Revenue Department of Hong Kong, no tax is payable in Hong Kong in respect of dividends paid by Ho Shun Yi. The laws
and regulations of the PRC do not currently have any material impact on transfer of cash from DH Enchantment, Inc. to Ho Shun Yi Limited
or from Ho Shun Yi Limited to DH Enchantment, Inc. There are no restrictions or limitation under the laws of Hong Kong imposed on the
conversion of HK dollar into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of Hong Kong or across borders and to U.S investors.
PRC Laws
There is a possibility that
the PRC could prevent our cash maintained in Hong Kong from leaving or the PRC could restrict the deployment of the cash into our business
or for the payment of dividends. Any such controls or restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance our cash requirements,
service debt or make dividend or other distributions to our shareholders.
Please see “Risk Factors - Our Hong Kong subsidiary
may be subject to restrictions on paying dividends or making other payments to us, which may restrict its ability to satisfy liquidity
requirements, conduct business and pay dividends to holders of DH Enchantment, Inc.’s common stock.”; “Risk Factors
- PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency
conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds we receive from offshore financing activities to make loans to or make additional
capital contributions to our Hong Kong subsidiary, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and
expand business.”; “Risk Factors - Because our holding company structure creates restrictions on the payment of dividends
or other cash payments, our ability to pay dividends or make other payments is limited.”
22
Current PRC regulations permit
PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to Hong Kong subsidiaries only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with
Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our subsidiaries in China is required to set aside at least 10% of
its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Each of
such entity in China is also required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund, although
the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion of its board of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be
used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective
companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. As of the date of this prospectus,
we do not have any PRC subsidiaries.
The PRC government also imposes
controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience
difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from
our profits, if any. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the
debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If we or our subsidiaries are unable to receive all of the revenues
from our operations, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.
Cash dividends, if any, on
our common stock will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay
to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of
up to 10.0%.
If in the future we have PRC
subsidiaries, certain payments from such PRC subsidiaries to Hong Kong subsidiaries will be subject to PRC taxes, including business taxes
and VAT. As of the date of this prospectus, we do not have any PRC subsidiaries, and our Hong Kong subsidiary has not made any transfers,
dividends or distributions to date. We do not expect our Hong Kong subsidiaries to make any such transfers, dividends or distributions
in the foreseeable future.
Pursuant to the Arrangement
between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income,
or the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement, the 10% withholding tax rate may be lowered to 5% if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns no
less than 25% of a PRC entity. However, the 5% withholding tax rate does not automatically apply and certain requirements must be satisfied,
including, without limitation, that (a) the Hong Kong entity must be the beneficial owner of the relevant dividends; and (b) the Hong
Kong entity must directly hold no less than 25% share ownership in the PRC entity during the 12 consecutive months preceding its receipt
of the dividends. In current practice, a Hong Kong entity must obtain a tax resident certificate from the Hong Kong tax authority to apply
for the 5% lower PRC withholding tax rate. As the Hong Kong tax authority will issue such a tax resident certificate on a case-by-case
basis, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority and
enjoy the preferential withholding tax rate of 5% under the Double Taxation Arrangement with respect to dividends to be paid by a PRC
subsidiary to its immediate holding company. As of the date of this prospectus, we do not have a PRC subsidiary. In the event that we
acquire or form a PRC subsidiary in the future and such PRC subsidiary desires to declare and pay dividends to our Hong Kong subsidiary,
our Hong Kong subsidiary will be required to apply for the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority. In such
event, we plan to inform the investors through SEC filings, such as a current report on Form 8-K, prior to such actions. See “Risk
Factors – Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong.” set forth in the Annual Report.
We are at a development stage
company and reported a net loss of $330,059 and $256,718 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We had current
assets of $36,032 and current liabilities of $802,940 as of December 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2022, we had current assets of $121,433
and current liabilities of $479,067. We have prepared our unaudited condensed financial statements for the nine months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021 assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon improving our
profitability and the continuing financial support from our stockholders. Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of
equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions and short-term and long-term debts.

Net
cash used in operating activities was $95,372 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the net cash used in operating
activities of $240,850 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease of $145,478 or 60% of net cash used in operating activities
was primarily due to the increase in net loss, and increase in accrual and other payables during the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of a net loss of $330,059, offset
by a decrease in accounts receivable of $5,537, decrease in prepayments and other receivables of $4,419 and increase in accrual and other
payables of $224,731.
For

or 89%. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to decrease in advance from a shareholder and repayment
of promissory notes, off set with cash proceeds from issuing promissory notes and advances from a director in the nine months ended December
31, 2022.
26
For
the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of a cash proceeds from issuing

Working Capital:
As of December 31, 2022 and
March 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalent of $35,951 and $111,396, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we have incurred accumulated
operating losses of $1,601,991 since inception. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, we had working capital deficit of $766,908
and $357,634, respectively.
Going Concern
We
require additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. Our auditor has expressed substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to
fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification
of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.
We
expect to incur marketing and professional and administrative expenses as well as expenses associated with maintaining our filings with
the Commission. We will require additional funds during this time and will seek to raise the necessary additional capital. If we are unable
to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our business development activities, which could harm our business
plans, financial condition and operating results. Additional funding may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. We intend to
continue to fund its business by way of equity or debt financing and advances from related parties. Any inability to raise capital as
needed would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If
we cannot raise additional funds, we will have to cease business operations. As a result, our common stock investors would lose all of
their investment.
Basis of preparation
Our
financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods.
Use of estimates
The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best
information available at the time the estimates are made; however actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
27
Income Taxes
We
account for income taxes as outlined in ASC 740, “Income Taxes”. Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
Off-balance Sheet
Arrangements
As
of December 31, 2022, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk
As a “smaller reporting
company”, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s
management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
An evaluation was conducted
under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms as a result of
the following material weaknesses:
☐
Because of the company’s limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing.
☐
There is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company’s management is composed of two persons, resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation, we would need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain optimal segregation of duties. Management will reassess this matter in the following year to determine whether improvement in segregation of duty is feasible.
☐
The Company does not have a sitting audit committee financial expert, and thus the Company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process.
28
☐
There is a lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions. The Company utilizes a third-party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements. Although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management, we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions. The third-party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the Company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reporting/consideration of certain transactions.
Our management will continue
to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on
an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and
as funds allow. In the meantime, management has engaged external consultants to minimize risk and ascertain compliance.
Changes in Internal Controls
There have been no changes
in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Securities
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred in the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
29
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings

any pending legal proceeding or litigation and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding
to which we area party or to which any of our properties is subject, which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect
on us.

company”, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.
