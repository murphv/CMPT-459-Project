NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES THE COMPANY 8x8, Inc. ("8x8" or the "Company") was incorporated in California in February 1987 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1996. The Company trades under the symbol "EGHT" on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, certain information and disclosures normally included in the Company's annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 and notes thereto included in the Form 10-K. There were no material changes during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 to the Company's significant accounting policies as described in the Form 10-K. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company conducts its operations through
one
reportable segment. In the opinion of the Company's management, these condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement of the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter or for the entire year ending March 31, 2023. All dollar amounts herein are in thousands of United States Dollars ("dollars") unless otherwise noted. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to current expected credit losses, returns reserve for expected cancellations, fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, capitalized internal-use software costs, benefit period for deferred commissions, stock-based compensation, incremental borrowing rate used to calculate operating lease liabilities, income and sales tax liabilities, convertible senior notes fair value, litigation, and other contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on known facts and circumstances, historical experience, and various other assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. OUT OF PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded out of period adjustments of approximately $ 2.5  million, including $ 1.3  million in subscription revenue related to two contracts with customers which was deferred in previous years, and $ 1.2  million of excess amounts reserved against bad debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The impact of these adjustments was a $ 1.3  million increase in service revenue and decrease in contract assets and a $ 1.2  million decrease in provision for bad debts and reduction in reserves. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. Effective April 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06 using a modified retrospective approach. Adoption of the new standard resulted in a decrease to accumulated deficit of $ 46.7  million, a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $ 92.8  million, and an increase to convertible senior notes, net of $ 46.2  million. 11 Table of Contents In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, and in January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), which refines the scope of Topic 848 and clarifies some of its guidance. Effective April 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-04 on a prospective basis. The impact of the adoption was immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial statements. Other recent accounting pronouncements that may be applicable to the Company are not expected to have a material impact on its present or future financial statements. 2.

Contract Balances The following table provides amounts of receivables, contract assets, and deferred revenue from contracts with customers:   December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Accounts receivable, net $ 53,811   $ 57,400   Contract assets, current 12,392   10,514   Contract assets, non-current 11,060   15,171   Deferred revenue, current 34,207   34,262   Deferred revenue, non-current 10,480   11,430   Contract assets, current, contract assets, non-current, deferred revenue, current and deferred revenue, non-current are recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in
Other current assets ,
Other assets , and
Other liabilities, non-current , respectively. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized revenues of approximately $ 31.5
million that were included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the fiscal year. Remaining Performance Obligations The Company's subscription terms typically range from
one
to
five years . Contract revenue from the remaining performance obligations that had not yet been recognized as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $ 750.0
million. This amount excludes contracts with an original expected length of less than one year. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately
80 % of the remaining performance obligations over the next
36
months and approximately
20 % over the remainder of the contract period. For purposes of this disclosure, the Company excludes contracts with an original expected length of less than one year.
Since the new and renewal contracts entered into with customers are generally for terms of one year or longer, updating this disclosure to include contracts with a term of one year or more presents a more appropriate measure of the Company's remaining performance obligations.
Deferred Sales Commission Costs Amortization of deferred sales commission costs for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $ 9.7
million and $ 28.5
million, respectively. Amortization of deferred sales commission costs for the three and nine
months ended December 31, 2021 was $ 8.7
million and $ 25.6
million, respectively. There were
no
material write-offs during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 12 Table of Contents 3.

The Company considers its investments available to support its current operations and has classified investments in debt securities as available-for-sale securities. The Company does not intend to sell any of its investments that are in unrealized loss positions
and, as of December 31, 2022, has determined that it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell any of these investments before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis. The Company regularly reviews the changes to the rating of its securities at the individual security level by rating agencies and reasonably monitors the surrounding economic conditions to assess the risk of expected credit losses. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not record any allowance for credit losses on its investments.
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of the Company's Notes was $ 242.5
million and $ 470.5
million, respectively, which was determined based on the closing price for the Notes on the last trading day of the reporting period and is considered to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy due to limited trading activity of the Notes. See Note

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Indemnifications In the normal course of business, the Company may agree to indemnify other parties, including customers, lessors, and parties to other transactions with the Company with respect to certain matters, such as breaches of representations or covenants or intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of the Company's exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company under these agreements have not had a material impact on the Company's operating results, financial position, or cash flows. Under some of these agreements, however, the Company's potential indemnification liability may not have a contractual limit. Operating Leases The Company's lease obligations consist of the Company's principal facility and various leased facilities under operating lease agreements. See Note 6.
Leases
for more information on the Company's leases and the future minimum lease payments. Purchase Obligations The Company's purchase obligations include contracts with third-party customer support vendors and third-party network service providers. These contracts include minimum monthly commitments and the requirements to maintain the service level for several months.
Legal Proceedings The Company may be involved in various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and other legal proceedings, including intellectual property, commercial, regulatory compliance, securities, and employment matters that arise in the normal course of business. The Company determines whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information to determine whether any accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Actual claims could settle or be adjudicated against the Company in the future for materially different amounts than the Company has accrued due to the inherently unpredictable nature of litigation. Legal costs are expensed as incurred. The Company believes it has recorded adequate provisions for any such lawsuits and claims and proceedings as of December 31, 2022. The Company believes that damage amounts claimed in these matters are not meaningful indicators of potential liability. Some of the matters pending against the Company involve potential compensatory, punitive, or treble damage claims or sanctions, that, if granted, could require the Company to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on its Consolidated Financial Statements. Given the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the ultimate outcome of the ongoing matters described herein cannot be predicted, and the Company believes it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it. Nevertheless, the Consolidated Financial Statements could be materially adversely affected in a particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. Wage and Hour Litigation. On September 21, 2020, the Company received a copy of a letter filed by a former employee, Plaintiff Denise Rivas, with the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”) providing notice of the Plaintiff’s intent to bring a Private Attorney General Act (“PAGA”) claim, on behalf of the Company’s non-exempt employees based in California, for alleged California wage and hour practices violations. On September 25, 2020, the Plaintiff filed a separate class action complaint (the “Class Complaint”) in Santa Clara County Superior Court against the Company in which she alleges 10 causes of action, on behalf of herself and all of the Company’s non-exempt employees based in California for the last four years, related to violations of California state wage and hour practices and the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.
The Class Complaint was served on the Company on September 29, 2020. On October 28, 2020, the Company filed a general denial of all claims and asserted various affirmative defenses. On October 29, 2020, the Company removed the matter to Federal Court. On December 1, 2020, Plaintiff filed a companion PAGA lawsuit complaint (the “PAGA Complaint”) in Santa Clara County Superior Court against the Company, in which she alleges 6 violations of California state wage and hour practices for all of the Company's current and former non-exempt employees based in California from September 16, 2019 to the present. The PAGA Complaint was served on the Company on December 11, 2020. On January 26, 2021, the Company filed a general denial of all claims and asserted various affirmative defenses to the PAGA Complaint.
Both actions were scheduled for a joint mediation in September 2021, and discovery was stayed in both actions pending completion of the mediation. A joint mediation for both actions was held in September 2021 and the parties reached a preliminary settlement of all claims, which was finalized on November 23, 2021. The parties have remanded the Class Complaint matter to Santa Clara County Superior Court in order to consolidate the matter with the PAGA Complaint matter for court approval and administration of the settlement. Plaintiff has filed an unopposed motion for preliminary approval of the settlement on May 17, 2022, and the court issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement on June 13, 2022.
The parties gathered and provided class list information to the administrator for administration of the settlement, and the administrator issued notifications to class members in August 2022. Plaintiff filed an unopposed motion for final approval of the settlement on October 12, 2022, and the court issued its order granting final approval on November 4, 2022. On January
16 Table of Contents 17, 2023, the Company deposited the total settlement amounts due with the settlement administrator, which will disburse the funds in accordance with the settlement agreement.
The Court has set a deadline of May 22, 2023 for Plaintiff’s counsel and the settlement administrator to submit a summary accounting of distributions, and the Court has scheduled a compliance hearing on June 1, 2023. State and Local Taxes and Surcharges From time to time, the Company has received inquiries from a number of state and local taxing agencies with respect to the remittance of sales, use, telecommunications, excise, and income taxes. Several jurisdictions currently are conducting tax audits of the Company's records. The Company collects or has accrued for taxes that it believes are required to be remitted. The amounts that have been remitted have historically been within the accruals established by the Company. The Company adjusts its accrual when facts relating to specific exposures warrant such adjustment. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company conducted a periodic review of the taxability of its services and determined that certain services may be subject to sales, use, telecommunications or other similar indirect taxes in certain jurisdictions. A similar review was performed on the taxability of services provided by Fuze, Inc., and it was determined that certain services may be subject to sales, use, telecommunications or other similar indirect taxes in certain jurisdictions. Accordingly, the Company recorded contingent indirect tax liabilities. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company had accrued contingent indirect tax liabilities of $ 16.2
million and $ 16.7
million, respectively.

CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES, TERM LOAN AND CAPPED CALLS
2024 Notes In February 2019, the Company issued $ 287.5
million aggregate principal amount of
0.50 % convertible senior notes (the "Initial 2024 Notes") due 2024 in a private placement, including the exercise in full of the initial purchasers' option to purchase additional notes. The total net proceeds from the debt offering, after deducting initial purchase discounts, debt issuance costs, and costs of the capped call transactions described below, were approximately $ 245.8
million. In November 2019, the Company issued an additional $ 75.0
million aggregate principal amount of
0.50 % convertible senior notes (the "First Additional 2024 Notes") due 2024 in a registered offering under the same indenture as the Initial 2024 Notes. The total net proceeds from the First Additional 2024 Notes, after deducting underwriting discounts, debt issuance costs, and costs of the capped call transactions described below, were approximately $ 64.6
million.
In December 2021, the Company issued an additional $ 137.5
million aggregate principal amount of its currently outstanding
0.50 % convertible senior notes (the "Second Additional 2024 Notes", and together with the Initial 2024 Notes and the First Additional 2024 Notes, the "2024 Notes") due 2024 in a private placement under the same indenture as the Initial 2024 Notes and the First Additional 2024 Notes. The total net proceeds from the Second Additional 2024 Notes, after deducting initial purchase discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $ 134.3  million. The Company did not enter into any capped calls in connection with this transaction. Both the First Additional 2024 Notes and Second Additional 2024 Notes constitute a further issuance of, and form a single series with, the Initial 2024 Notes. Immediately after giving effect to the issuance of the Second Additional 2024 Notes, the Company had $ 500.0
million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes. For details on the net carrying amount and fair value of the liability component of the 2024 Notes, as well as the interest expense recognized related to the 2024 Notes, see the section entitled “Exchange Transaction and 2028 Notes” below. The 2024 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2019. The Notes will mature on February 1, 2024, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted.
Each $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes is initially convertible into 38.9484 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $ 0.001 , which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 25.68
per share. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or following the Company's issuance of a notice of redemption, in each case as described in the Indenture, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such a corporate event or during the relevant redemption period. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 1, 2023, the 2024 Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances: 1. At any time during any calendar quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on June 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least
20
trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of
30
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to
130 % of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; 2. During the
five
business day period immediately after any
ten
consecutive trading day period (the measurement period), if the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than
98 % of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock on each such trading day and the conversion rate on each such trading day; 17 Table of Contents 3. If the Company calls any or all of the Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or 4. Upon the occurrence of specified corporate events (as set forth in the indenture governing the 2024 Notes). On or after October 1, 2023, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will satisfy its conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company's election. The Company’s current intent is to settle the principal amount of the 2024 Notes in cash upon conversion. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the conditions allowing holders of the 2024 Notes to convert were not met. Under the terms of the 2024 Notes, the Company could not redeem the Notes prior to February 4, 2022. On or after February 4, 2022, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the 2024 Notes at the redemption price equal to
100 % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if the last reported sale price of the common stock has been at least
130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least
20
trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any
30
consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides a redemption notice. If a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) occurs at any time, holders of 2024 Notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to
100 % of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The 2024 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment with the Company’s existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of current or future subsidiaries of the Company. Prior to April 1, 2022, the Company accounted for the 2024 Notes as separate liability and equity components. On issuance, the carrying amount of the equity components was recorded as a debt discount and subsequently amortized to interest expense. Effective April 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06 using a modified retrospective approach. As a result, the 2024 Notes are accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as no other embedded features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. Adoption of the new standard resulted in a decrease to accumulated deficit of $ 46.7  million, a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $ 92.8  million and an increase to convertible senior notes, net of $ 46.2  million. The 2024 Notes have no original issuance discounts .
Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs will be amortized over the remaining life of the 2024 Notes, which is approximately
13
months.      Capped Calls In connection with the pricing of the Initial 2024 Notes and the First Additional 2024 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the "Capped Calls") with certain counterparties. The Capped Calls each have an initial strike price of approximately $ 25.68  per share, subject to certain adjustments, which correspond to the initial conversion price of the Initial 2024 Notes and the First Additional 2024 Notes. The Capped Calls have initial cap prices of $ 39.50  per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Calls are expected to partially offset the potential dilution to the Company’s Common Stock upon any conversion of the Initial 2024 Notes and the First Additional 2024 Notes, with such offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately  14.1
million shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The Capped Calls are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including merger events, tender offers, and announcement events. In addition, the Capped Calls are subject to certain specified additional disruption events that may give rise to a termination of the Capped Calls, including nationalization, insolvency or delisting, changes in law, failures to deliver, insolvency filings, and hedging disruptions. For accounting purposes, the Capped Calls are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Initial 2024 Notes and the First Additional 2024 Notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the Capped Calls are recorded in stockholders' equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The Capped Calls will not be remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. Term Loan and Warrants On August 10, 2022, the Company borrowed $ 250.0  million in a senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan”) under a term loan credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) entered into on August 3, 2022 with Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as administrative agent, and certain affiliates of Francisco Partners (“FP”), with aggregate debt issuance costs and discount of approximately $ 20.0  million. The Term Loan matures on August 3, 2027 and will initially bear interest at an annual rate equal to the term Standard Overnight Financing Rate ("Term SOFR") (which will be subject to a floor of
1.00 % and a credit spread adjustment of
0.10 %), plus a margin of
6.50 %.
The obligations under the Credit Agreement will be guaranteed by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exceptions, and secured by a perfected security interest in substantially all of the Company’s tangible and intangible assets, as well as substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the guarantors. 18 Table of Contents Mandatory prepayments of the Term Loan are required to be made upon the occurrence of certain events, including, without limitation, (i) sales of certain assets, (ii) receipt of certain casualty and condemnation awards proceeds, and (iii) the incurrence of non-permitted indebtedness, subject to certain thresholds and reinvestment rights. Voluntary prepayments are permitted at any time, subject to certain prepayment premiums. The Credit Agreement contains a minimum adjusted cash Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) financial covenant, a minimum liquidity covenant and a maximum secured leverage ratio financial covenant and contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for transactions of this type, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, dividends, disposition of assets, change in business, and transactions with affiliates. The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of the Term Loan to fund the cash portion of an exchange of the Company’s approximately $ 403.8  million principal amount of the 2024 Notes for cash plus approximately $ 201.9  million of the 2028 Notes (defined below), and the concurrent repurchase of approximately $ 60  million of the Company’s common stock with the counterparties to such exchange. The debt discount and debt issuance costs are approximately $ 5.6  million, of which $ 2.8  million was paid in the form of shares of the Company's common stock, and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the Term Loan at an effective interest rate of
11.0 %. Contractual interest expenses of $ 5.4  million and $ 8.8  million, and $ 0.8  million and $ 1.2  million in amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs, were related to the Term Loan and recorded for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company issued detachable warrants (the “Warrants”) to affiliates of FP to purchase an aggregate of
3.1  million shares of the Company’s common stock with a
five-year
term and an exercise price of $ 7.15
per share (subject to adjustment) that represents a
27.5 % premium over the closing price per share of the Company’s common stock on August 3, 2022. The Warrants are classified as liabilities as the Warrants contain certain terms that could result in cash settlement as a result of events outside of the Company’s control. Accordingly, the Company recognizes the Warrants as liabilities at fair value initially and adjusts the Warrants to fair value at each reporting period. The fair value of the Warrants was $ 5.9  million upon issuance, and $ 5.4  million at December 31, 2022, and was recorded within Other liabilities, non-current on the condensed consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding debt discount recorded against the Term Loan. The subsequent changes in fair value were recorded through Other income (expense), net on the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations.
The following table presents the net carrying amount of the Term Loan: December 31, 2022 Principal $ 250,000   Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs ( 18,798 ) Net carrying amount $ 231,202   Interest expense recognized related to the Term Loans was as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31,   2022 2022 Contractual interest expense $ 5,432   $ 8,835   Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs 788   1,221   Total interest expense $ 6,220   $ 10,056   Exchange Transaction and 2028 Notes
Exchange Transaction On August 11, 2022, the Company issued approximately $ 201.9  million aggregate principal amount of its
4.00 % convertible senior notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”), pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 11, 2022 (the “2028 Notes Indenture”), by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”).
The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Notes, together with approximately $ 181.8  million in cash consideration from borrowing of the Term Loan, in exchange for approximately $ 403.8  million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s outstanding 2024 Notes pursuant to privately negotiated agreements (the “Exchange Agreements”) with a limited number of existing holders of the 2024 Notes (the “Exchange Transaction”). In connection with the Exchange Transaction, the Company purchased an aggregate of approximately $ 60  million of the Company’s common stock in privately negotiated transactions from existing holders of the 2024 Notes who participated in the Exchange Transaction. The Exchange Transaction was treated as a debt extinguishment. The difference between the consideration used to extinguish the 2024 Notes and the carrying value of the 2024 Notes (including unamortized debt discount and issuance costs) subject to the Exchange Transaction resulted in an extinguishment gain of $ 16.1  million recorded through Other income (expense), net on the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations.
19 Table of Contents The Capped Calls were not modified or settled as part of the Exchange Transaction and continue to be classified in stockholders' equity as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. 2028 Notes As part of the Exchange Transaction, the Company issued $ 201.9  million aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes, with debt issuance costs of approximately $ 5.6  million, of which
50 % was paid in the form of shares of the Company's common stock. The 2028 Notes are senior obligations of the Company that accrue interest, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on February 1, 2023. The 2028 Notes will mature on February 1, 2028, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The initial conversion rate is 139.8064 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 7.15
per share), subject to customary adjustments. The 2028 Notes can be convertible into cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s stock, at the Company’s election.
Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding November 15, 2027, the 2028 Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances: 1. At any time during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on December 31, 2022 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least
20
trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of
30
consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to
130 % of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; 2. During the
five
business day period immediately after any
five
consecutive trading day period (the measurement period), if the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than
98 % of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; 3. If the Company calls any or all of the 2028 Notes for redemption prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding November 15, 2027; or 4. Upon the occurrence of specified corporate events (as set forth in the 2028 Notes Indenture). On or after November 15, 2027, holders of the 2028 Notes may convert their 2028 Notes at their option at any time until the close of business on the second Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the maturity date. Under the terms of the 2028 Notes, the Company cannot redeem the 2028 Notes prior to August 6, 2025. On or after August 6, 2025, the Company may, at its option, redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2028 Notes at a redemption price equal to
100 % of the principal amount, plus accrued unpaid interest, only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, including if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least
130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least
20
trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any
30
consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides a redemption notice.
If a fundamental change (as defined in the 2028 Notes Indenture) occurs at any time prior to February 1, 2028, holders of 2028 Notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2028 Notes at a repurchase price equal to
100 % of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. In addition, in connection with certain corporate events or if the Company issues a notice of redemption, a fundamental change will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for holders who elect to convert their 2028 Notes in connection with such corporate event or during the relevant redemption period. The 2028 Notes Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or holders of no less than
25 % in aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes then outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of all the 2028 Notes, and the interest accrued on such 2028 Notes, if any, to become immediately due and payable. Upon events of default in connection with specified bankruptcy events involving the Company, the 2028 Notes will become due and payable immediately. The debt discount and debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2028 Notes at an effective interest rate of
6.1 % . Interest expense recognized related to the 2028 Notes was as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 Contractual interest expense $ 2,037   $ 3,181   Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs 247   350   Total interest expense $ 2,284   $ 3,531   20 Table of Contents The following table presents the net carrying amount of the 2028 Notes: December 31, 2022 Principal $ 201,914   Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs ( 5,291 ) Net carrying amount $ 196,623   Repayment of 2024 Notes
In addition to the Exchange Transaction, the Company completed two repurchases of the 2024 Notes in the second and third quarter of fiscal 2023 for a total of approximately $ 27.8  million in aggregate principal amount. In the second quarter, on September 28, 2022, the Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $ 6.0  million of the 2024 Notes through a privately negotiated transaction with one of the remaining 2024 Notes holders for an aggregate purchase price of $ 5.3  million. The aggregate purchase price was paid in cash and only partially settled the outstanding 2024 Notes with the holder; accordingly, the repurchase consideration was accounted for as a debt modification with no extinguishment gain or loss. In the third quarter, on December 9, 2022, the Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $ 21.8  million of the 2024 Notes through privately negotiated transactions with two of the remaining 2024 Notes holders for an aggregate purchase price of $ 20.1  million in cash. The repurchase consideration was accounted for as a debt extinguishment, resulting in a $ 2.1  million gain. The following table presents the net carrying amount and fair value of the liability component of the 2024 Notes: December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Principal $ 68,339   $ 500,000   Unamortized debt discount (1)
and issuance costs ( 519 ) ( 52,548 ) Net carrying amount $ 67,820   $ 447,452   (1) The debt discount as of March 31, 2022 represents the discount resulting from the allocation of the equity component (conversion option) from the liability component of the 2024 Notes, net of issuance premium, prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on April 1, 2022. Upon the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the equity component was reversed. As a result, the December 31, 2022 debt discount represents only the issuance premium.
The debt discount and debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2024 Notes at an effective interest rate of
1.2 %. Interest expense recognized related to the 2024 Notes was as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Contractual interest expense 139 $ 486   $ 1,099   $ 1,359   Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs 101 4,925   $ 1,565   13,389   Total interest expense $ 240   $ 5,411   $ 2,664   $ 14,748   9.

INCOME TAXES The Company's effective tax rate was ( 0.1 )% and ( 0.2 )% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively; and was ( 1.7 )% and ( 0.4 )% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate was primarily due to the full valuation allowance the Company maintains against its deferred tax assets and driven by current tax liabilities of profitable foreign subsidiaries and state minimum taxes in the United States. The effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the Provision for income taxes by the Loss before provision for income taxes. 11.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. As discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Statements,” the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, particularly those set forth under the section entitled "Risk Factors" in the Form 10-K. OVERVIEW We are a leading SaaS provider of voice, video, contact center, and communication APIs powered by a global cloud communications platform. From our proprietary cloud technology platform, organizations across all their locations and employees have access to unified communications, team collaboration, video conferencing, contact center, data and analytics, communication APIs, and other services, enabling them to be more productive and responsive to their customers. Our customers range from small businesses to large enterprises and their users are spread across more than 180 countries. In recent years, we have increased our focus on the mid-market and enterprise customer sectors. We have a portfolio of cloud-based offerings that are subscription-based, made available at different rates, varying by the specific functionalities, services, and number of users. We generate service revenue from communications services subscriptions and platform usage. We generate other revenue from professional services and the sale of office phones and other hardware equipment. We define a “customer” as one or more legal entities to which we provide services pursuant to a single contractual arrangement. In some cases, we may have multiple billing relationships with a single customer (for example, where we establish separate billing accounts for a parent company and each of its subsidiaries). Our flagship service is our 8x8 XCaaS platform, which is a unified, cloud-based technology platform that includes a range of enterprise-grade Unified Communications-as-a-Service (UCaaS) and Contact Center-as-a-Service (CCaaS) solutions. Our
25 Table of Contents customers purchase service plans with increasing functionality designated as X1, X2, etc., through X8, based on the specific communication needs and customer engagement profile of each user.
Because XCaaS serves as a single integration framework for communications across an organization, customers can reduce costs associated with provisioning and management, increase customization based on use cases, and ensure compliance with security and data privacy requirements on a global scale. XCaaS also includes integrations with more than 50 third party applications, including Microsoft Teams. In January 2022, we acquired Fuze, Inc., a competitor in UCaaS for the enterprise, for approximately $213.8 million in stock and cash. The acquisition of Fuze, Inc. increased our installed base of enterprise customers and accelerated innovation on the XCaaS platform.
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, our total revenue grew $27.5 million, or approximately 18% year-over-year, to $184.4 million. Excluding $26.5 million of revenue from the Fuze customer base, our total revenue increased approximately 1% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, our total revenue grew $102.7 million, or approximately 22% year-over-year, to $559.4 million. Excluding $84.4 million of revenue from the Fuze customer base, our total revenue increased 4% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. As part of our long-term strategy to increase profitability and cash flow, we continue to focus on reducing the cost of delivering our services and improving our operating efficiency, while increasing our revenue and Annualized Recurring Subscriptions and Usage Revenue (ARR) from XCaaS and enterprise customers. We believe that continued innovation is necessary to meet the evolving needs of today’s workforce and is a critical factor in attracting and retaining high value enterprise customers. We have focused our sales and marketing to drive awareness of the XCaaS product and unique features that 8x8 provides its customers. We are committed to increasing our investment in research and development in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 because we believe innovation will drive future competitive advantage through product differentiation and is an important variable in achieving sustainable growth. Our acquisition of Fuze, Inc. increased our engineering resources dedicated to innovation on our XCaaS platform.
ARR from mid-market and enterprise customers represented 76% of total ARR and increased 30% compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. ARR associated with small business customers increased 4% year-over-year and accounted for 24% of total ARR, compared to 28% of ARR a year ago. We have focused our sales and marketing resources on increasing our enterprise ARR as a long-term strategy due to enterprise customers' longer commitments, higher retention, and better efficiency ratios. Enterprise customers are also more likely to need the advanced capabilities of our contact center solutions and realize the advantages of our unified XCaaS platform.
See "Key Business Metrics" section below for further discussion on how we define ARR. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, enterprise customers accounted for 57% of total ARR and approximately 40% of our ARR was derived from customers deploying the UCaaS and CCaaS capabilities of our XCaaS platform. In August 2022, we took steps to improve our capital structure by refinancing approximately $403.8 million of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes through an exchange for approximately $201.9 million in 2028 Notes plus approximately $181.8 million in cash. The cash payment was funded with the partial proceeds of a $250.0 million senior secured term loan facility due in 2027 entered into on August 10, 2022.
At the same time as we issued the 2028 Notes, we repurchased 10,695,000 shares of our common stock for approximately $60.0 million in privately negotiated transactions with a limited number of holders. Subsequently, on September 28, 2022, we repurchased an additional $6.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes in a separate privately negotiated transaction. On December 9, 2022, we repurchased an additional aggregate principal amount of $21.8 million of the 2024 Notes through privately negotiated transactions with two of the remaining 2024 Notes holders for an aggregate purchase price of $20.1 million. Approximately $68.3 million of the 2024 Notes was outstanding as of December 31, 2022. See Part I, Item 1,

to our condensed consolidated financial statements for details. Approximately two-thirds of our investment in research and development is focused on extending the contact center capabilities of our XCaaS platform. We plan to continue our efforts to reduce our unit costs to improve our gross profit margin as our business scales. Additionally, we plan to reduce our investments in sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue as we focus on driving improved efficiencies in our customer acquisition and sales operations.
As part of this focus, in October 2022 and January 2023, we conducted two separate workforce reductions involving approximately 300 employees, primarily focused on sales and marketing and general and administrative functions. We expect these workforce reductions and organizational realignments to improve our operational efficiency and align our resources to our critical areas of focus including streamlining sales and marketing, enhancing customer support, accelerating CCaaS innovation, and strengthening our financial position. IMPACT OF COVID-19 The full extent of the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including those set forth under the section entitled "Risk Factors" in the Form 10-K. Our workforce continues to spend significant time working from home, even as travel for our employees begins to return to pre-COVID-19 levels. It is not clear what the full potential effects of the global health crisis caused by COVID-19 will be on our business, including the effects on our customers, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results, in
26 Table of Contents the future, particularly if governments were to re-enact various measures previously implemented to slow the spread of COVID-19, including orders to close non-essential businesses and for residents to isolate in their homes. KEY BUSINESS METRICS Our management periodically reviews certain key business metrics to evaluate our operations, allocate resources, and drive financial performance in our business.
Annualized Recurring Subscriptions and Usage Revenue Our management reviews Annualized Recurring Subscriptions and Usage Revenue (“ARR”) and believes it may be useful to investors to evaluate trends in future revenues
of
the
Company.
Our
management
believes
ARR
is
an
important
indicator
for
measuring
the
overall
performance
of
the
business.
Our management
uses
trends
in
ARR
to
assess
our
ongoing
operations,
allocate
resources,
and
drive
the
financial
performance
of
the
business.
We define ARR as equal to the sum of the most recent month of (i) recurring subscription amounts and (ii) platform usage charges for all CPaaS customers (subject to a minimum billings threshold for a period of at least six consecutive months), multiplied by 12. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARR and caution that our presentation may not be consistent with that of other companies. For example, to the extent our ARR is used to evaluate trends in future revenue, such an evaluation would assume a sustained level of usage from existing customers which may fluctuate in future periods. COMPONENTS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Service Revenue
Service revenue consists of communication services subscriptions, platform usage revenue, and related fees from our UCaaS, CCaaS, and CPaaS offerings. We plan to continue to invest resources to increase service revenue through a combination of sales and marketing efforts, expansion of our global connectivity, innovation in product and technology, and strategic acquisitions of technologies and businesses. Other Revenue Other revenue consists of revenues from professional services, primarily in support of deployment of our solutions and/or platform, and revenues from sales and rentals of IP telephones in conjunction with our cloud telephony service. Other revenue is dependent on the number and size of customers who choose to purchase or rent an IP telephone in conjunction with our UCaaS service and choose to engage our professional services organization for implementation and deployment of our cloud UCaaS and CCaaS solutions.
Cost of Service Revenue Cost of service revenue consists primarily of costs associated with network operations and related personnel, technology licenses, amortization of capitalized internal-use software, other communication origination and termination services provided by third-party carriers and outsourced customer service call center operations, and other costs such as customer service and technical support costs. We allocate overhead costs, such as IT and facilities, to cost of service revenue, as well as to each of the operating expense categories, generally based on relative headcount. Our IT costs include costs for IT infrastructure and personnel. Facilities costs primarily consist of office leases and related expenses. Cost of Other Revenue Cost of other revenue consists primarily of direct and indirect costs associated with the purchasing of IP telephones as well as the scheduling, shipping and handling, personnel costs, expenditures incurred in connection with the professional services associated with the deployment and implementation of our products, and allocated IT and facilities costs. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs, third-party development, software and equipment costs necessary for us to conduct our product, platform development and engineering efforts, and allocated IT and facilities costs. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs, sales commissions, including those to the channel, trade shows, advertising and other marketing, demand generation, promotional expenses, and allocated IT and facilities costs. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs, professional services fees, corporate administrative costs, tax and regulatory fees, and allocated IT and facilities costs. Other Expense, Net 27 Table of Contents Other expense, net, consists primarily of interest expense related to the term loan and convertible notes, partially offset by income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, investments, and gains / losses from foreign exchange, debt extinguishment and warrants measurement. Provision for (benefit from) Income Taxes Provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of foreign income taxes and state minimum taxes in the United States. As we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the United States and foreign taxation of such activities may increase our overall provision for income taxes in the future. We have a valuation allowance for our United States deferred tax assets, including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. We expect to maintain this valuation allowance until it becomes more likely than not that the benefit of our federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized by way of expected future taxable income in the United States. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Our results of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and the discussion below, include Fuze, Inc.'s results of operations, while the results of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 did not include Fuze, Inc.’s results of operations, since it was acquired on January 18, 2022. Our results of operations are also impacted by fluctuations in foreign currencies. For additional information, please refer to Part 1, Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks. ( dollars in thousands ) Revenue Service revenue   2022 2021 Change Three Months Ended December 31, $ 175,765 $ 149,396 $ 26,369  17.7  % Percentage of total revenue 95.3  % 95.2  %     Nine Months Ended December 31, $ 533,482  $ 429,568  $ 103,914  24.2  % Percentage of total revenue 95.4  % 94.0  % Service revenue increased
for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a net increase in our installed base of mid-market and enterprise customers, expanded deployments by existing customers, and growth in related telecom usage by our customers. Nearly all growth for service revenue in the three months ended December 31, 2022 was attributable to our acquisition of Fuze, Inc., which contributed approximately $26.5 million and $83.7 million in service revenue for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The increase in service revenue reflected increased sales of our UCaaS and CCaaS solutions, increased adoption of our XCaaS integrated communication and collaboration platform, and growth in sales of our UCaaS direct routing solution for Microsoft Teams users. The increase in service revenue from these sources was partially offset by a decrease in usage revenue generated by our CPaaS products, primarily in the Asia-Pacific region.
We expect our service revenue to grow over time with our diverse platform offering as we increase the features and functionality of our platform and expand the global coverage of our UCaaS services.

Other revenue decreased for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, due to decreased professional services revenue. No single customer represented more than 10% of our total revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 28 Table of Contents Cost of Revenue Cost of service revenue 2022 2021 Change Three Months Ended December 31, $ 47,335 $ 48,763 $ (1,428) (2.9) % Percentage of service revenue 26.9  % 32.6  %     Nine Months Ended December 31, $ 151,920 $ 141,971  $ 9,949  7.0  % Percentage of service revenue 28.5  % 33.0  % Cost of service revenue decreased in dollars and as a percentage of service revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to decreases of $2.8 million in communication infrastructure costs resulting from cost of sales improvement process and $1.0 million in amortization of capitalized software. This was partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Cost of service revenue increased in dollars but decreased as a percentage of service revenue for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, due to increases of $5.2 million in employee and consulting related costs, $2.9 million in depreciation of intangibles, $2.5 million in communication and infrastructure costs, and $1.1 million in software costs. This was partially offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in amortization of capitalized software. We expect cost of service revenue will increase in absolute dollars but generally decrease as a percentage of revenue in future periods.

These increases were partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses. Research and development increased in dollars and as a percentage of other revenue
for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases of $20.0 million in personnel-related and consulting costs substantially related to our acquisition of Fuze, Inc., $4.2 million in software licenses, and $2.5 million in public cloud services, and a $5.9 million reduction in capitalized internal-use software costs. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $3.7 million in stock-based compensation expenses and $1.2 million in amortization of capitalized software.
We plan to continue to invest in research and development to accelerate our efforts to expand the capabilities and scope of our XCaaS platform to enhance our users' experience. While we expect to continue to improve our cost structure and achieve operational efficiencies, we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in our development efforts and vary from period-to-period as a percentage of revenue.

These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $5.3 million in personnel-related and consulting expenditures, including a $5.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Sales and marketing increased in dollars but decreased as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases of $19.1 million in channel commissions, $8.7 million in amortization of intangibles, and
$2.9 million in amortization of deferred sales commission costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $18.5 million in personnel-related and consulting expenditures, including a $17.2 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
We expect sales and marketing costs as a percentage     of revenue to decrease over time as we continue to focus on improving our cost structure and achieving operational efficiencies.

These decreases were partially offset by increases of $4.2 million in personnel-related and consulting costs, $1.9 million in legal and regulatory costs, and $1.3 million in facilities and overhead costs. General and administrative increased in dollars but decreased as a percentage of other revenue for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases of $11.5 million in personnel-related and consulting salary costs, $5.6 million in legal and regulatory costs, $4.4 million in facilities and overhead costs, $1.5 million in contract termination expense, and $1.2 million in bad debt and credit loss. These increases were partially offset by a $11.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses. 30 Table of Contents We expect to continue improving our cost structure and achieve operational efficiencies, and therefore, also expect that general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue will decline over time.

These were partially offset by a $2.1 million gain from debt extinguishment and $1.8 million gain from sale of intangibles.
Other income (expense), net increased for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a $18.2 million gain from debt extinguishment from the 2024 convertible notes, $2.4 million gain from foreign exchange transactions, $1.8 million gain from sale of intangibles, and $0.5 million gain on remeasurement of warrants issued in connection with the term loan.

Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, we had $131.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and investments, including $1.3 million in restricted cash in support of letters of credit securing leases for office facilities and certain equipment.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, expenditure, and contractual obligation requirements for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repaid $21.8 million of our existing convertible notes maturing in 2024, as further described in Part I, Item 1, Note 8.
Convertible Senior Notes, Term Loan and Capped Calls
to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future, any future refinancing, the success of our operations, the global economic outlook (including the impact of inflationary pressures and foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations), and the pace of sustainable growth in our markets, as well as continued uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the continuing war in Ukraine, among other factors, could impact our business and liquidity. Period-over-Period Changes Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $35.2 million, as compared to $18.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Cash used in or provided by operating activities is primarily affected by: • net income or loss; • non-cash expense items, such as depreciation, amortization, and impairments; • non-cash gain associated with extinguishment of debt, or changes in fair value of liabilities; • non-cash expense associated with stock options and stock-based compensation and awards; • gain or loss on sale of assets; and 31 Table of Contents • changes in working capital accounts, particularly related to the timing of collections from receivables and payments of obligations, such as commissions. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided in operating activities reflected an adjustment of
$141.7 million in non-cash charges to our net loss, including stock-based compensation expense of $73.5 million, depreciation and amortization expenses of $40.4 million, amortization of deferred sales commission costs of $28.5 million,
$18.3 million gain from debt extinguishment, operating lease expenses of $8.7 million, impairment of capitalized software of $3.7 million , and $1.8 million gain on sale of assets. Non-cash adjustments were partially offset by $42.9 million of working capital adjustments driven by
$23.5 million in deferred sales commission costs and $22.9 million in accounts payable and accruals. Net cash provided in investing activities was $0.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $30.1 million of cash used in the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 primarily related to $10.1 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, $2.7 million in net acquisition of property, plant and equipment, and $1.0 million in proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment, which was partially offset by $6.8 million in capitalization of internally developed software, and $1.3 million payout of the cash holdback related to the Fuze, Inc. acquisition.
Net cash used in financing activities was $36.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $100.0 million of cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by
$211.8 million of net repayment and refinancing of convertible senior notes and $60.2 million of shares repurchased, which were substantially offset by $234.0 million of net proceeds from the term loan. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Refer to Note
1 ,
The Company and Significant Accounting Policies , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report, which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Other than the adoption of ASU 2020-06 as discussed in Note
1 ,
The Company and Significant Accounting Policies , in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report, there have been no significant changes during the three months ended December 31, 2022 to our critical accounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in the Form 10-K. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Fluctuation Risk We had cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling $131.7 million as of December 31, 2022. Cash equivalents and investments were invested primarily in money market funds, United States treasury, commercial paper, and corporate bonds. Our investment policy is focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity needs. Under the policy, we invest in highly rated securities, while limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer other than the United States government. We do not invest in financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments. We utilize external investment managers who adhere to the guidelines of our investment policy. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of our cash, cash equivalents, or available-for-sale investments. As of December 31, 2022, there were $68.3 million of convertible senior notes maturing in 2024 and $201.9 million of convertible senior notes maturing in 2028 outstanding, and a $250.0 million senior secured term loan facility maturing in 2027. The fair value of the convertible notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors due to the conversion feature. The fair value of the convertible senior notes will generally increase as the Company's common stock price increases and will generally decrease as its common stock price declines. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of the convertible senior notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations, due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation. Additionally, we carry the convertible senior notes at face value, less unamortized discount, on our consolidated balance sheets, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only. 32 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We operate in international markets and typically invoice our customers and pay our expenses in local currencies, primarily the British pound and the Euro. As a result, changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the United States dollar may impact our revenue and operating expenses upon translation in our consolidated financial statements. Historically, the impacts on revenue and expenses have substantially offset one another, and the effects of currency on operating and net income have not been material. As our foreign operations expand, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our revenue and operating expenses may not continue to offset one another and may impact our operating results. Gains or losses from the revaluation of certain cash balances, accounts receivable balances, and intercompany balances that are denominated in local currencies, primarily the British pound and the Euro, are reflected as foreign currency translation adjustments in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. A hypothetical decrease in all foreign currencies against the United States dollar of 10% would not result in a material foreign currency loss on foreign-denominated balances as of December 31, 2022.
At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2022. As permitted by SEC guidance for newly acquired businesses, this evaluation did not include an assessment of those disclosure controls and procedures that are subsumed by and did not include an assessment of internal control over financial reporting as it relates to Fuze, Inc., which was acquired on January 18, 2022.
The Company has excluded Fuze from its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2022 .
Based on such evaluation, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the three months ended December 31, 2022, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

Commitments and Contingencies
under the heading “Legal Proceedings” in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report is incorporated by reference in response to this item. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Investing in our securities involves risk. Prior to making a decision about investing in our securities, you should carefully consider the specific factors discussed below and under the heading “Risk Factors” in any prospectus supplement, together with all of the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report. You should also consider the risk factors related to our business and operations described in Part I, Item 1A of the Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors" and in Part II, Item 1A of the Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2022 under the heading “Risk Factors,” which are incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our operations. Cyber intrusions, breaches of our networks or systems or those of our service and cloud storage providers, and other malicious acts could adversely impact our business. Our business operations, from our internal and service operations to research and development activities, sales and marketing efforts and customer and partner communications, depend on our ability to protect our network from interruption by damage from
33 Table of Contents hackers, social engineering and phishing, ransomware, computer viruses, worms, other malicious software programs, or similar disruptive problems or other events beyond our control. Individuals or entities have attempted, and will attempt, to penetrate our network security, and that of our platform, and try to cause harm to our business operations, including by misappropriating our proprietary information or that of our customers, employees and business partners or causing interruptions of our products and platform. In particular, cyberattacks and other malicious internet-based activity continue to increase in frequency and in magnitude both generally and specifically against us and other cloud-service providers. For example, during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we detected malware on our network that permitted an intrusion by an unauthorized third party to access certain data stored on our network. We responded quickly and implemented measures to identify and remove the intruder and malware from our network and secure our data. We subsequently learned during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, in December 2022, that the unauthorized third party possessed approximately a terabyte of our confidential information from several back-office servers. The unauthorized third party attempted to make ransom demands for the return of our confidential information, which we did not pay. We continue to implement new technological measures to prevent, detect, and contain such intrusions as well as build and strengthen ongoing employee awareness, education and training, but we cannot guarantee we will be able to prevent, detect or contain all future cyber intrusions, nor can we guarantee that our backup systems, regular data backups, security protocols, DDoS mitigation, and other procedures that are currently in place, or may be in place in the future, will be adequate to prevent significant damage, system failure, or data loss. Inherent in our provision of services are the storage, processing, and transmission of our customers' data, which may include confidential and sensitive information. Customers may use our services to store, process, and transmit a wide variety of confidential and sensitive information, such as credit card, bank account, and other financial information, proprietary information, trade secrets, or other data that may be protected by sector-specific laws and regulations, like intellectual property laws, laws addressing the protection of personally identifiable information (or personal data in the EU), as well as the Federal Communications Commission’s, or the FCC’s, customer proprietary network information (“CPNI”) rules. We may be targets of cyber threats and security breaches, given the nature of the information that we store, process, and transmit and the fact that we provide communications services to a broad range of businesses. To the extent that state-sponsored incidents of cybersecurity breaches increase due to geopolitical tensions, this risk may continue to increase. In addition, we use third-party vendors, which in some cases have access to our data and our customers' data. Despite the implementation of security measures by us or our vendors, our computing devices, infrastructure, or networks, or our vendors' computing devices, infrastructure, or networks may be vulnerable to hackers, social engineering and phishing, ransomware, computer viruses, worms, other malicious software programs, or similar disruptive problems due to a security vulnerability in our or our vendors' infrastructure or network, or our vendors, customers, employees, business partners, consultants, or other internet users who attempt to invade our or our vendors' public and private computers, tablets, mobile devices, software, data networks, or voice networks. If there is a security vulnerability in our or our vendors' infrastructure or networks that is successfully targeted, we could face increased costs, liability claims, government investigations, fines, penalties or forfeitures, class action litigation, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.
