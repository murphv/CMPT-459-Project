NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION
Business
InnerScope Hearing Technologies,
Inc. (“Company”, “InnerScope”) is a Nevada Corporation incorporated on June 15, 2012, with its principal place
of business in Roseville, California. The Company was originally named InnerScope Advertising Agency, Inc. and was formed to provide advertising
and marketing services to retail establishments in the hearing device industry. On August 25, 2017, the Company changed its name to InnerScope
Hearing Technologies, Inc. to better reflect the Company’s current direction as a hearing health technology company that manufactures,
develops, distributes, and sells numerous innovative hearing health-related products, hearing treatments, and hearing solutions direct
to consumer (DTC) with a scalable business model.
NOTE 2
– SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements in this report have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary
to present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the stated periods have been made. Except as described below,
these adjustments consist only of normal and recurring adjustments. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the
Company’s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with
a reading of the Company’s financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report for the year ended December 31,
2019, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 14, 2022. Interim results of
operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, and 2019, are not necessarily indicative of future results for the
full year. Certain amounts from the 2019 period have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in the current period.
Emerging Growth Companies
The Company qualifies as an “emerging
growth company” under the 2012 JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage
of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
As an emerging growth company, the Company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. The Company has elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period for certain accounting
standards.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Cash
The Company considers all highly
liquid investments when acquired with an original term of three months or less to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at
cost, which approximates fair value. We held no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. Cash balances may, at
certain times, exceed federally insured limits. If the amount of a deposit at any time exceeds the federally insured amount at a bank,
the uninsured portion of the deposit could be lost, in whole or in part, if the bank were to fail.
Accounts receivable
The Company records accounts receivable
at the time products and services are delivered. An allowance for losses is established through a provision for losses charged to expense.
Receivables are charged against the allowance for losses when management believes collectability is unlikely. The allowance (if any) is
an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses on existing receivables, based on evaluation of the collectability
of the accounts and prior loss experience. As of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, management’s evaluation required the
establishment of an allowance for uncollectible receivables of $27,991.

Following is a summary of customers
who accounted for more than ten percent (10%) of the Company’s revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 and

Inventory
Inventory is valued at the
lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first in first out (FIFO) method. Provision for potentially obsolete
or slow-moving inventory is made based on management analysis or inventory levels and future sales forecasts. As of September 30, 2020,
and December 31, 2019, management’s analysis did not require any provisions to be recognized.
Intangible Assets
Costs for intangible assets
are accounted for through the capitalization of those costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining such assets. Capitalized
costs are included in intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets. On October 3, 2018, the Company entered into a Manufacturing
Design and Marketing Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Zounds Hearing, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Zounds”),
whereby, Zounds as the Subcontractor will provide design, technology, manufacturing and supply chain services to the Company (see Note
15) for a period of ten years. The Company will pay Zounds One Million ($1,000,000) for the right to use proprietary technology (the “Technology
Access Fee”). As of December 31, 2018, the Company has capitalized the $1,000,000 Technology Access Fee as an intangible asset on
the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Technology Access Fee will be amortized over the term of the Agreement. During the year
ended December 31, 2020 (subsequent to period end), the Company determined that they do not expect to realize any benefit in the foreseeable
future, therefore, have recorded an impairment of $775,000.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated
at cost, and depreciation is provided by use of a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company reviews
property and equipment for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of assets
may not be recoverable. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as
follows:
Computer equipment
3 years
Machinery and equipment
5 years
Furniture and fixtures
5 years
The Company's property and equipment consisted
of the following at September 30, 2020, and December 31,

for the
three
months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Investment in Undivided Interest in
Real Estate
The Company accounts for its’ investment in undivided interest in real estate
using the equity method, as the Company is severally liable only for the indebtedness incurred with its interest in the property. The
Company includes its allocated portion of net income or loss in Other income (expense) in its Statement of Operations, with the offset
to the equity investment account on the balance sheet. For the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized
a gain of $15,450 and a loss of $9,245, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized a
gain of $22,982 and a loss of $4,429, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the carrying value of the Company’s
investment in undivided interest in real estate
was
$1,220,069 and $1,210,526 respectively
(see Note
8).
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company measures assets and
liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, which represents
the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction
between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either
a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level.
The following are the hierarchical levels
of inputs to measure fair
value:
• Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices in active
markets for identical assets or
liabilities.
• Level 2 - Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other
than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable
market data by correlation or other means.
• Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company's
assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market
participant assumptions that are reasonably available.
The carrying amounts of the

Embedded Conversion Features
The Company evaluates embedded
conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815 "Derivatives and Hedging" to determine whether the embedded conversion
feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded
in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under ASC 815, the instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20
"Debt with Conversion and Other Options" for consideration of any beneficial conversion feature.

Derivative Financial
Instruments
The Company does not use derivative
instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of it financial instruments,
including stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.
For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair
value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income.
For option-based
simple derivative financial instruments, the Company uses the Monte Carlo simulations to value the derivative instruments at inception
and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as
liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.
Debt Issue Costs and Debt Discount
The Company may record debt
issue costs and/or debt discounts in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt. These costs may be paid in the form of
cash, or equity (such as warrants). These costs are amortized to interest expense through the maturity of the debt. If a conversion of
the underlying debt occurs prior to maturity a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.
Original Issue Discount
For certain convertible debt issued,
the Company may provide the debt holder with an original issue discount. The original issue discount would be recorded to debt discount,
reducing the face amount of the note and is amortized to interest expense through the maturity of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying
debt occurs prior to maturity a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.
Revenue Recognition
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company
adopted ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”) and all the related amendments. The
Company elected to adopt this guidance using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The core principle of ASC 606 requires
that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this
core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than
required under U.S. GAAP including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration
to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.
The Company’s contracts with
customers are generally on a purchase order basis and represent obligations that are satisfied at a point in time, as defined in the new
guidance, generally upon delivery or has services are provided. Accordingly, revenue for each sale is recognized when the Company has
completed its performance obligations, Any costs incurred before this point in time, are recorded as assets to be expensed during the
period the related revenue is recognized. The Company accepts prepayments on hearing aids and records the amount received as customer
deposits on its’ balance sheet. When the Company delivers the hearing aid to the customer, revenue is recognized as well as the
corresponding cost of sales.
As of September 30, 2020 and December
31, 2019, the Company had received $13,321 and $21,505 of customer deposits, where revenue will be recognized when the hearing aids are
delivered to the customer.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income
taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the estimated future
tax effects, calculated at the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time of realization. A valuation allowance related to a deferred
tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates of the date of
enactment.
10
ASC
740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements
and provides guidance on recognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure
and transition issues. Interest and penalties are classified as a component of interest and other expenses. To date, the Company has
not been assessed, nor paid, any interest or penalties.
Uncertain tax positions are measured
and recorded by establishing a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to
be taken in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized
or continue to be recognized.
Advertising and Marketing Expenses
The Company expenses advertising
and marketing costs as incurred. For the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 advertising and marketing expenses were $3,703
and $197,733, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 advertising and marketing expenses were $19,775 and
$575,050, respectively.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
The Company reports earnings (loss)
per share in accordance with ASC 260, "Earnings per Share." Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed
by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive
securities outstanding during the period. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s outstanding convertible debt is convertible
into 4,707,741,429 and 393,621,118 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment based on changes in the Company’s stock price,
respectively. This amount is not included in the computation of dilutive loss per share because their impact is antidilutive.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2018, the
FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Changes to Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements”, which will improve the effectiveness
of disclosure requirements for recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The standard removes, modifies, and adds certain disclosure
requirements, and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019 (for
“emerging growth company” beginning after December 15, 2020). Subsequent to period end, the Company has adopted this standard,
and the adoption of this standard did not have any significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
The FASB recently
issued ASU 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470- 20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts
in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity,
to reduce complexity in applying GAAP to certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. The guidance in
ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock by removing the existing guidance
in ASC 470-20, Debt: Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which requires entities to account for beneficial conversion features and
cash conversion features in equity, separately from the host convertible debt or preferred stock. The guidance in ASC 470-20 applies to
convertible instruments for which the embedded conversion features are not required to be bifurcated from the host contract and accounted
for as derivatives. In addition, the amendments revise the scope exception from derivative accounting in ASC 815-40 for freestanding financial
instruments and embedded features that are both indexed to the issuer’s own stock and classified in stockholders’ equity,
by removing certain criteria required for equity classification. These amendments are expected to result in more freestanding financial
instruments qualifying for equity classification (and, therefore, not accounted for as derivatives), as well as fewer embedded features
requiring separate accounting from the host contract. The amendments in ASU 2020-06 further revise the guidance in ASC 260, Earnings Per
Share, to require entities to calculate diluted earnings per share (EPS) for convertible instruments by using the if-converted method.
In addition, entities must presume share settlement for purposes of calculating diluted EPS when an instrument may be settled in cash
or shares. The amendments in ASU 2020-06 are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early
adoption permitted (for “emerging growth company” beginning after December 15, 2023). The Company will be evaluating the impact
this standard will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
11
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842,
Leases (ASU 2018-10), which provides narrow amendments to clarify how to apply certain aspects of the new lease standard, and ASU No. 2018-11,
Leases (Topic 842) —Targeted Improvements (ASU 2018-11), which addressed implementation issues related to the new lease standard.
These and certain other lease-related ASUs have generally been codified in ASC 842. ASC 842 supersedes the lease accounting requirements
in ASC Topic 840, Leases (ASC 840). ASC 842 establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and
a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases. Under ASC 842, leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification
affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 was effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within that reporting period (for “emerging growth company” from January 1,
2020). The Company adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 using the effective date transition method.
The Company elected
the practical expedient to not record short-term leases on its consolidated balance sheet.
NOTE 3 –
GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT’S PLANS
The accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. which
assumes the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company experienced
a net loss of $4,208,363 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020, the Company had a working capital deficit
of $10,685,835, and an accumulated deficit of $18,504,831. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern and to operate in the normal course of business. These consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities
that might result from this uncertainty.

NOTE 11 – DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES
The Company determined that the conversion
features of the convertible notes represented embedded derivatives since the Notes are convertible into a variable number of shares upon
conversion. Accordingly, the notes are not considered to be conventional debt under EITF 00-19 and the embedded conversion feature is
bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for as a derivative liability. Accordingly, the fair value of these derivative instruments
is recorded as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding amount recorded as a discount to each Note, with any
excess of the fair value of the derivative component over the face amount of the note recorded as an expense on the issue date. Such discounts
are amortized from the date of issuance to the maturity dates of the Notes. The change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities
are recorded in other income or expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations at the end of each period, with the offset
to the derivative liabilities on the balance sheet.
The Company valued the derivative
liabilities at issuance, September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, at $412,806 and $4,745,194, respectively. The Company used
the
multinomial lattice v aluation model with the following assumptions for new notes issued during the
period
ended September 30, 2020, risk-free interest rate of 0.05% and volatility of 150% to 250%, and as of December 31, 2019, risk-free
interest rate of 0.05% and volatility of 200% to 300%.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
The following is management’s
discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as well as information relating to the plans of our current management.
This report includes forward-looking statements. Generally, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “may,”
“will,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “continue,”
and similar expressions or the negative thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements
are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including the matters set forth in this report or other reports or documents we file with
the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those
projected. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake
no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
The following discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for
the year ended December 31, 2019 and filed by the Company on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 14, 2022.

be indicative of actual operating results in the future.

in the normal course of business over a reasonable length of time, our independent auditor’s report on our financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 includes a “going concern” explanatory paragraph that describes substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to the factors prompting the explanatory paragraph
are discussed below and also in Note 4 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
Corporate History and Current
Business
InnerScope Hearing Technologies, Inc.
(“Company”, “InnerScope”) is a Nevada Corporation incorporated on June 15, 2012, with its principal place of business
in Roseville, California. The Company was originally named InnerScope Advertising Agency, Inc. and was formed to provide advertising and
marketing services to retail establishments in the hearing device industry. On August 25, 2017, the Company changed its name to InnerScope
Hearing Technologies, Inc. to better reflect the Company’s current direction as a technology driven company with a scalable business
to business (BTB) solution and business to consumer (and BTC) solution. The Company also competes in the DTC (Direct-to-Consumer) markets
with its own line of “Hearables”, and “Wearables”, including APPs on the iOS and Android markets. On September
10, 2018, the Company acquired all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Kathy L Amos Audiology (“Amos Audiology”)
in exchange for 340,352 shares of common stock (the “Acquisition”). Amos Audiology provides retail hearing aid sales and audiological
services in the East Bay area of San Francisco. Additionally, the Company has opened 9 retail hearing device clinics, manages two clinics

Results of
Operations
For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 revenues.
Revenues for the three months ended
September 30, 2020 were $47,331 compared to $250,781 for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The revenue decrease was primarily
due to COVID-19. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were $144,318 compared to $656,983 for the nine months ended September
30, 2019. The revenue decrease was primarily due to COVID-19.
Online
sales
Beginning in the second quarter
of 2018, the Company began to market a line of PSAP hearables and wearables and during the third quarter of 2018, expanded their line
of products to include FDA registered hearing aid devices. Online sales are down in the current periods due to the marketing resources
being reallocated to the Retail Centers sales operations. Online marketing platforms are ready to go with the potential of revenue increases,
once the company has the proper capital resources to be allocated to online marketing. Online sales will be a major part and focus of
management once the company is properly capitalized.

Capital Resources and

The current liabilities are comprised of accounts payable, accrued expenses, notes payable, convertible notes payable, operating lease
liabilities, customer deposits, salaries and taxes payable, and derivative
liabilities.
Our ability to operate over
the next twelve months, is contingent upon continuing to realize sales revenue sufficient to fund our ongoing expenses. If we are unable
to sustain our ongoing operations through sales revenue, we intend to fund operations through debt and/or equity financing arrangements,
which may be insufficient to fund our working capital, or other cash requirements. There can be no assurance that such additional financing
will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We do not have any formal commitments or arrangements for the sales of stock or
the advancement or loan of funds at this time.

Critical Accounting
Policies
Basis of
presentation
The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("US
GAAP"). The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the consolidated accounts of InnerScope and its’
wholly owned subsidiaries ILLC and Intela-Hear, a California limited liability company. All intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of
estimates
The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue
Recognition
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company
adopted ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”) and all the related amendments. The
Company elected to adopt this guidance using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The core principle of ASC 606 requires
that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this
core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than
required under U.S. GAAP including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration
to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.
The Company’s contracts with
customers are generally on a purchase order basis and represent obligations that are satisfied at a point in time, as defined in the new
guidance, generally upon delivery or has services are provided. Accordingly, revenue for each sale is recognized when the Company has
completed its performance obligations. Any costs incurred before this point in time, are recorded as assets to be expensed during the
period the related revenue is recognized. The Company accepts prepayments on hearing aids and records the amount received as customer
deposits on its’ balance sheet. When the Company delivers the hearing aid to the customer, revenue is recognized as well as the
corresponding cost of sales.
Income
taxes
The Company uses the liability
method of accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. A valuation allowance can be provided for a net deferred tax asset, due to uncertainty of realization.
Net loss per common
share
The Company reports earnings (loss)
per share in accordance with ASC 260, "Earnings per Share." Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed
by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive
securities outstanding during the period. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s outstanding convertible debt is convertible
into approximately 4,707,741,429 and 393,621,118 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment based on changes in the Company’s
stock price, respectively. This amount is not included in the computation of dilutive loss per share because their impact is antidilutive.

Item 4. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in
the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due
to control deficiencies. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness
or accuracy of our information. The Company does not have an Audit Committee to oversee management activities, and the Company is dependent
on third party consultants for the financial reporting function.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15
of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Part II.
Other Information
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
On May 26, 2017, Helix Hearing Care
(California), Inc. a California corporation (“Helix”), filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) against the InnerScope
and the Moores, in the Circuit Court of the 11 th
Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade
County, Florida, that includes a rescission of the Consulting Agreement, on the basis that an injunction against certain Officers and
Directors renders the Consulting Agreement impossible to perform. InnerScope was not named as an enjoined party in such previous litigation,
and the services contemplated under the Consulting Agreement are not within the scope of the injunction, thus InnerScope believes the
accusation by the third party is frivolous and without merit, as well as not providing sufficient cause for the Agreement to be terminated.
InnerScope and the Moores filed
their Answer and Affirmative Defenses to the Complaint on June 27, 2017. On the same date, InnerScope, the Moores, and MFHC filed a counterclaim.
On February 27, 2018, the Counterclaim was amended to include four claims for breach of contract, one claim for anticipatory breach of
contract, one claim for negligent misrepresentation, and one claim for account stated. On August 13, 2018, Helix, InnerScope and the Moores
executed a Settlement Agreement.
Item 1A. Risk
Factors
We are a smaller reporting company
as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities and Use of
Proceeds
During the period end September
30, 2020, the Company issued 3,114,005,479 shares of common stock for partial conversion of principal and accrued interest.
The issuances described above were
made in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Sections 3(a)(9) and 4(a)(1) of the Securities Act as the common stock
was issued in exchange for debt securities of the Company held by each shareholder, there was no additional consideration for the exchange,
there was no remuneration for the solicitation of the exchange, the shareholders were not affiliates, and they had held the underlying
debt securities for the required time. The holders provided legal opinions pursuant to Section 4(a)(1) of Securities Act, or Rule 144
promulgated thereunder.
