9 Table of Contents   Golden Matrix Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)   NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Organization and Operations   Golden Matrix Group, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively, “ Golden Matrix ”, “ GMGI ” “ we ”, “ our ”, “ us ”, or “ Company ”) is incorporated and registered in the State of Nevada, and operates as (i) an innovative provider of enterprise Software-as-a-Service (“ SaaS ”) solutions for online casino operators and online sports betting operators, commonly referred to as iGaming operators and, (ii) a provider of pay to enter prize competitions in the United Kingdom (UK).   The Company has historically operated in the business-to-business (“ B2B ”) segment where it develops and owns online gaming intellectual property (IP) and builds configurable and scalable, turn-key, and white-label gaming platforms for international customers, located primarily in the Asia Pacific region. In the B2B segment, the Company has developed a proprietary Internet gaming enterprise software system that provides for unique casino and live game operations on the platforms that include GM-X System (“ GM-X ”) and GM-Ag System, Turnkey Solution and White Label Solutions. These platforms are provided to Asia Pacific Internet-based and land-based casino operators as a turnkey technology solution for regulated real money Internet gaming (“ RMiG ”), Internet sports gaming, and virtual simulated gaming (“ SIM ”).   With the acquisition of
80 % of RKingsCompetitions Ltd. (“ RKings ”) effective on November 1, 2021 (and the acquisition of the remaining
20 % of RKings effective November 4, 2022), the Company entered into the business-to-consumer (“B2C”) segment by offering what we refer to as “pay to enter prize competitions” throughout the UK. These prize competitions are not gambling or a lottery; we do not offer B2C online sports betting and/or online casino services in the UK. The prize competitions require entrants to demonstrate sufficient skill, knowledge or judgment to have a chance of winning and participants are provided with a route to free entry to the prize competitions as required by UK law. Also, effective on August 1, 2022, the Company expanded its B2C reach by acquiring GMG Assets Limited (“ GMG Assets ”), a UK company, which was formed to facilitate the Company’s operation of RKings. On July 11, 2022, the Company acquired Golden Matrix MX, S.A. DE C.V., which had no assets or operations at the time of acquisition and was formed for the benefit of the Company, for the sole purpose of operating an online casino in Mexico, named Mexplay, which is planned to feature an extensive number of table games, slots, as well as sportsbook, and offers tournament competition prizes similar to those offered by RKings.
The Company’s online casino and related activities in Mexico have not yet commenced as the online casino and website is still under development and enhancements to the online casino are still ongoing, and marketing efforts in connection with the online casino have not yet started.   In the B2C segment, the Company has improved functionality and responsiveness of the RKingsCompetitions.com website and expanded its marketing efforts from Northern Ireland to encompass the UK as its customer reach.

Effective August 1, 2022, the Company acquired a 100% ownership interest in GMG Assets.     11 Table of Contents   The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, “ Business Combinations ”. Identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Any adjustments to the purchase price allocation are made during the measurement period, not exceeding one year from the acquisition date, in accordance with ASC 805. The Company recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquired subsidiary at fair value. The excess of the purchase price and the fair value of non-controlling interest in the acquired subsidiary over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary is recognized as goodwill. Identifiable assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include contingent liability, stock-based compensation, warrant valuation, accrued expenses and collectability of accounts receivable. The Company evaluates its estimates on an on-going basis and bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions the Company believes to be reasonable. Due to inherent uncertainties, actual results could differ from those estimates.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company currently has no cash equivalents at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022.   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 0
and $ 0 , respectively. During the three months ending January 31, 2023 and the twelve-month period ending October 31, 2022, there was no bad debt recorded.
Website Development Costs   The Company accounts for website development costs in accordance with ASC 350-50 “ Website Development Costs ”. Accordingly, all costs incurred in the planning stage are expensed as incurred, costs incurred in the website application and infrastructure development stage that meet specific criteria are capitalized and costs incurred in the day-to-day operation of the website are expensed as incurred. All costs associated with the websites are subject to straight-line amortization over a three-year period. During the three months ended January 31, 2023, $ 52,788
in development costs, or related costs were incurred and capitalized.   Software Development Costs   The Company capitalizes internal software development costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software application in accordance with guidelines established by ASC 985-20-25 “ Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Marketed ”, requiring certain software development costs to be capitalized upon the establishment of technological feasibility. The establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of these costs require considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors such as anticipated future revenue, estimated economic life, and changes in software and hardware technologies. Amortization of the capitalized software development costs begins when the product is available for general release to customers. Capitalized costs are amortized based on the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product.     12 Table of Contents   Inventories, Prizes   RKings purchases prizes to award to winners of prize competitions; these prizes are RKings’ inventory. Operations that include prizes are only through RKings. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the specific identification method (which approximates the previously reported first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method and there is no change (or cumulative change) resulting from a change in accounting method). Costs include expenditures incurred in the normal course of business in bringing stocks to their present location and condition. Full provision is made for obsolete and slow-moving items. Net realizable value comprises actual or estimated selling price (net of discounts) less all costs to complete and costs incurred in marketing and selling. Inventory was $ 1,612,975
and $ 1,147,591
at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively.
Property, Plant and Equipment   Plant and machinery, fixtures, fittings, and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation is computed pursuant to the straight-line method over the useful life of four years. The depreciable life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term. Property, plant and equipment were $ 78,484
and $ 72,411
at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively.
Impairment of Intangible Assets   In accordance with ASC 350-30-65 “ Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ”, the Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important, which could trigger an impairment review include the following:     1. Significant underperformance compared to historical or projected future operating results;   2. Significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; and   3. Significant negative industry or economic trends.   When the Company determines that the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows, the Company records an impairment charge. The Company measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent to the current business model. Significant management judgment is required in determining whether an indicator of impairment exists and in projecting cash flows. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives. The Company incurred amortization expense of $ 106,666
and $ 94,169
during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.   Revenue Recognition   The Company currently has three distinctive revenue streams. In the B2B segment there are two revenue streams (i) charges for usage of the Company’s software, and (ii) royalty charged on the use of third-party gaming content. In the B2C segment, the revenue stream is related to the prize competition tickets sold to enter prize competitions in the UK through RKings.   B2B segment, revenue descriptions:     1. For the usage of the Company’s software, the Company charges gaming operators for the use of its unique intellectual property (IP) and technology systems.   2. For the royalty charged on the use of third-party gaming content, the Company acquires the third-party gaming content for a fixed cost and resells the content at a margin.   B2C segment, revenue descriptions:     The Company generates revenues through RKings from sales of prize competitions tickets directly to customers, throughout the United Kingdom, for prizes ranging from automobiles to jewelry, as well as travel and entertainment experiences.
13 Table of Contents   Pursuant to FASB Topic 606, Revenue Recognition, our company recognizes revenues by applying the following steps:   Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer. Step 2: Identify the separate performance obligations in the contract. Step 3: Determine the transaction price. Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract. Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.   For the usage of the Company’s software, the Company provides services to the counterparty which include licensing the use of its unique IP and technology systems. The counterparty pays consideration in exchange for those services which include a variable amount depending on the Software Usage. The Company only recognizes the revenue at the month end when the usage occurs, and the revenue is based on the actual Software Usage of its customers.   For the royalty charged on the use of third-party gaming content, the Company acts as a distributor of the third-party gaming content which is utilized by the client. The counterparty pays consideration in exchange for the gaming content utilized. The Company only recognizes the revenue at the month end when the usage of the gaming content occurs, and the revenue is based on the actual usage of the gaming content.   For the prize competitions ticket sales, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration RKings expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
Payments for prize competitions received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when control of the prize has been transferred to the winner of prize competitions.   Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share   Basic net earnings (loss) per share of common stock is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common stock shares (Common Shares) outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings (loss) per Common Share are determined using the weighted-average number of Common Shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents.   The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and warrants is reflected in diluted earnings (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of outstanding convertible securities is reflected in diluted earnings (loss) per share by application of the if-converted method.   The following is a reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022:       For the three months ended       January 31,       2023     2022                 Basic earnings (loss) per common share             Numerator:             Net income (loss) available to common shareholders   $ ( 443,521 )   $ 349,379   Denominator:                 Weighted average common shares outstanding     33,311,667       27,747,956                     Basic earnings (loss) per common share   $ ( 0.01 )   $ 0.01                     Diluted earnings (loss) per common share                 Numerator:                 Net income (loss) available to common shareholders   $ ( 443,521 )   $ 349,379   Denominator:                 Weighted average common shares outstanding     33,311,667       27,747,956   Preferred shares     -       1,000   Warrants/Options     -       7,939,394   Consideration payable             70,332   Adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding     33,311,667       35,758,682                     Diluted earnings (loss) per common share   $ ( 0.01 )   $ 0.01       14 Table of Contents   Income Taxes   The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and loss carry-forwards and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rules on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the year of change. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is “ more likely-than-not ” that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.   Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions   The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency. For these foreign entities, we translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period for income statement amounts and using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities. We record these translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of Equity, in our consolidated balance sheets. We record exchange gains and losses resulting from the conversion of transaction currency to functional currency as a component of other income (expense).   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “ Fair Value Measurements ”, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in US GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 does not require any new fair value measurements, but it does provide guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs).   The hierarchy consists of three levels:     · Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   · Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets of liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.   · Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.   The Company uses Level 3 inputs for its valuation methodology for the warrant derivative liabilities and embedded conversion option liabilities.   Financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and customer deposits. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments in the accompanying balance sheets approximate their fair values due to their relatively short-term nature. It is management’s opinion that the Company is not exposed to any significant currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.     15 Table of Contents   Stock-Based Compensation   The Stock-based compensation expense is recorded as a result of stock options granted in return for services rendered. For the comparative periods, the stock-based payment arrangements with employees were accounted for under FASB ASC 718, “ Compensation - Stock Compensation ” while nonemployee stock-based payments issued for goods and services are accounted for under ASC 505-50 “ Equity - Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees ”. ASC 505-50 differs significantly from ASC 718. ASC 505-50 was updated with FASB issued ASU 2018-07, which aligned share-based payments granted to non-employees (for goods and services) with the requirements for share-based payments granted to employees.
The expenses related to the stock-based compensation are recognized on each reporting date. The amount is calculated as the difference between total expenses incurred and the total expenses already recognized.   The stock-based compensation of options issued to consultants was recognized as a component of cost of goods sold since the stock-based compensation is the direct labor cost associated with running the Company’s GM2 Asset system.   Recent Issued Accounting Pronouncements   The Company does not believe that any recently issued effective pronouncements, or pronouncements issued but not yet effective, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.   NOTE 2 – ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET

Related Party Asset Acquisition
Acquisition of GMG Assets   On October 17, 2022, and effective on August 1, 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “GMG Purchase Agreement”), to acquire a
100 % ownership interest in GMG Assets, a private limited company formed under the laws of Northern Ireland from Aaron Johnston and Mark Weir, individuals, the owners of 100% of the ordinary issued share capital (100 Ordinary Shares) of GMG Assets. Aaron Johnston was then a Board Member of the Company, Mark Weir was then a 10% Shareholder in RKings, of which the Company then owned 80% of, and as such were both related parties to the Company.
Pursuant to the GMG Purchase Agreement, which was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, the Company agreed to pay the sellers 25,000 British pound sterling (GBP) (approximately $ 30,708 ) for 100% of GMG Assets, which represented the combined costs paid by the sellers to form GMG Assets. GMG Assets was formed for the sole purpose of facilitating the Company’s operation of RKings and to facilitate cash alternative offers for winners of prizes within RKings’ business. The consideration was paid on March 6, 2023.
Third Party Business Acquisition   RKings Acquisition   On November 29, 2021, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement, to acquire an
80 % ownership interest in RKings from Mark Weir and Paul Hardman, individuals (each a “ Seller ” and collectively the “ Sellers ”), the then owners of
100 % of the ordinary issued share capital of RKings.
RKings is a United Kingdom based online competition company offering business-to-consumer tournaments whereby individuals can purchase entries for online prize drawings.     17 Table of Contents   Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Sellers agreed to sell the Company
80 % of the outstanding capital stock of RKings (the “ Purchase ” and the “ RKings Stock ”). In consideration for the RKings Stock, we agreed to pay the Sellers, pro rata with their ownership of RKings:     (1) a cash payment of GBP £3,000,000 (USD $ 4,099,500 ); (2) 666,250
restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $7.60 per share (the “ Closing Shares ” and the “ Initial Share Value ”); and (3) within seven days after the receipt of the audit of RKings (as required by Securities and Exchange Commission (“ SEC ”) rules and regulations), an additional number (rounded to the nearest whole share) of restricted shares of Company common stock, equal to (i)
80 % of RKings’ net asset value (inventory on hand (minus allowances for reserve inventory and allocated goods and materials) plus RKings’ total cash and cash equivalents on hand; less RKings’ current and accrued liabilities, as described in greater detail in the Purchase Agreement) as of October 31, 2021, divided by (ii) the Initial Share Value (the “ Post-Closing Shares ”).
On December 6, 2021, the Company paid the Sellers the cash payment of GBP £3,000,000 (USD $ 4,099,500 ) (described in (1) above) and, on November 29, 2021, the Company issued the
666,250
restricted shares of the Company’s common stock (described in (2) above). Also, on March 7, 2022, the Company issued
70,332
restricted shares of the Company’s common stock in payment of
80 % of RKings’ net asset value as of October 31, 2021 (described in (3) above), in the amount of $ 562,650 .   The Purchase Agreement provided for a total of GBP £1,000,000 (USD $ 1,366,500 ) (the “ Holdback Amount ”) to be retained by the Company, following closing, which was to be released to the Sellers within six months after the closing date only to the extent that (A) RKings achieved revenue of at least USD $ 7,200,000
during the six full calendar months immediately following the closing date; and (B) the Sellers did not default in any of their obligations, covenants or representations under the Purchase Agreement or other transaction documents. On June 1, 2022, the Company notified the Sellers that they were in default, under the Purchase Agreement, of their obligations (aforementioned (B) above). Consequently, the Company notified the Sellers that their right to receive the £ 1,000,000
Holdback Amount and the £ 4,000,000
Earn-Out Consideration had been terminated. However, effective on August 4, 2022, we entered into a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (the “ Settlement Agreement ”) with Mark Weir, one of the two sellers of the 80% interest in RKings.
The Settlement Agreement was entered into to partially settle certain breaches of the Purchase Agreement which the Sellers (Mr. Weir and Mr. Paul Hardman) whereby we agreed to pay to Mr. Weir in the amount of £450,000 (approximately $548,112), representing one-half of the £1,000,000 (approximately $1,218,027) Holdback Amount, less £50,000 (approximately $60,902) in excess salary payments made to Mr. Weir (the “Settlement Payment”) . The Settlement Payment was in full satisfaction of all payments (including any portion of the Holdback Amount or Earn-Out Consideration (defined and discussed below)), due to Mr. Weir under the Purchase Agreement. The Settlement Payment was paid in full on August 21, 2022. The Company’s ongoing disputes and claims against Mr. Hardman, the other Seller, relating to breaches of the terms of the Purchase Agreement by Mr. Hardman, remain outstanding and the Company is continuing to pursue such claims.   RKings Notice of Buyout   The RKings Purchase Agreement also required that the Sellers and the Company enter into a Shareholders Agreement (the “Shareholders Agreement”), which was entered into and became effective on November 29, 2021, and which provides various rights and restrictions on the owners of RKings. One of those rights was a buyout right provided to the Company (the “Buyout Right”), which beginning on May 29, 2022 (the date that was six months from November 29, 2021), which provided the Company, upon written notice to the Sellers, the right to purchase all, but not less than all, of the shares of RKings then held by the Sellers (i.e., the 20% of RKings retained by such Sellers following the closing of the Purchase Agreement) for an aggregate purchase price equal to 20% of the product of (i) RKings’ then most recent three-month trailing EBITDA multiplied by (ii) sixteen (the “Buyout Price”). The Buyout Price was payable at the option of the Company in either (x) cash; or (y) shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $8.00 per share or any combination thereof.   On October 27, 2022, the Company exercised its Buyout Right by providing written notice to each of the Sellers. In connection with such exercise, the Company agreed to pay each Seller USD $ 661,773 , which is equal to their pro rata portion of the Buyout Price, which was satisfied by the issuance by the Company to each Seller of
82,722
shares of restricted common stock of the Company (with such shares being valued at $ 8.00
per share pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders Agreement) (an aggregate of
165,444
shares of common stock of the Company, the “Buyout Shares”).

For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, RKings did not achieve the aforementioned EBITDA Metric and did not earn the Earn-Out Consideration.   On December 6, 2021, the Company closed the Purchase, which had an effective date of November 1, 2021.   The Purchase Agreement also required that the Sellers and the Company enter into a Shareholders Agreement (the “ Shareholders Agreement ”), which was entered into and became effective on November 29, 2021.   In accordance with FASB ASC Section 805, “ Business Combinations ”, the Company has accounted for the Purchase Agreement transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method. Due to the continuity of operations that will remain after the acquisition, the acquisition was considered the acquisition of a “ business ”.   Goodwill is measured as a residual and calculated as the excess of the sum of (1) the purchase price to acquire 80% of RKings’ shares, which was $11,092,150, and (2) the fair value of the
20 % noncontrolling interest in RKings, which was estimated to be $ 2,705,000 , over the net of the acquisition-date values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.   The Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with FASB ASC 805, “ Business Combinations ”. The preliminary fair value of purchase consideration for the acquisition has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a preliminary valuation of their respective fair values and may change when the final valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is determined.   As described more fully in “ NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES ”, the assets and liabilities of RKings have been recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date and are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.   RKings’ results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning November 1, 2021. RKings contributed revenues of $ 25,500,035
and net income attributable to the Company of $ 1,677,577
for the period from the date of acquisition through January 31, 2023.

Also, Sellers had breached the Shareholders Agreement as well as their fiduciary duties as stipulated in the Shareholders Agreement dated November 29, 2021.     19 Table of Contents   Based on the foregoing, and without limitation as to other breaches by either Seller, the Company notified the Sellers that they were in breach of the Purchase Agreement and demanded that each Seller cease and desist from further actions in breach of the Purchase Agreement or in violation of applicable law. In addition, the Company notified the Sellers of their indemnification obligations under the Purchase Agreement and the Company’s decision to terminate the Sellers’ right to receive the £1,000,000 Holdback Amount and the £4,000,000 Earn-Out Consideration. In addition, the Company has the right to set off any amounts which are the subject of an indemnification claim against such Holdback Amount and Earn-Out Consideration. Therefore, no contingent liability was recorded.   RKings Settlement & Release   On August 1, 2022, and effective on August 4, 2022, we entered into a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (the “ Settlement Agreement ”) with Mark Weir, one of the two sellers of the 80% interest in RKings which we acquired effective on November 1, 2021, pursuant to the November 29, 2021 Sale and Purchase Agreement of Ordinary Issued Share Capital. The Settlement Agreement was entered into in order to partially settle certain breaches of the Purchase Agreement which the Sellers (Mr. Weir and Mr. Paul Hardman) were jointly and severally responsible for pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, (a) we agreed to make a payment to Mr. Weir in the amount of £450,000 (approximately $ 548,112 ), representing one-half of the £1,000,000 (approximately $ 1,218,027 ) Holdback Amount, less £50,000 (approximately $ 60,902 ) in excess salary payments made to Mr. Weir (the “ Settlement Payment ”); (b) Mr. Weir agreed to enter into an employment agreement with RKings; and (c) we and Mr. Weir, on behalf of ourselves and our affiliates and representatives, provided each other mutual releases, subject to certain customary exceptions. The Settlement Payment was in full satisfaction of all payments (including any portion of the Holdback Amount or Earn-Out Consideration), due to Mr. Weir under the Purchase Agreement.

Long-lived assets consist of property, plant and equipment, net, intangible assets, operating lease right-of-use assets, and goodwill, and are attributed to the geographic region in which they are located.   The following is a summary of revenues by geographic region, for the indicated periods (as a percentage of total revenues):       For the Three Months Ended   Description   January 31, 2023     January 31, 2022   Revenues:                         Asia Pacific   $ 4,224,457       39 %   $ 3,380,830       38 % UK     6,553,222       61 %     5,496,275       62 % Total   $ 10,777,679       100 %   $ 8,877,105       100 %   The following is a summary of revenues by products for the indicated periods (as a percentage of total revenues):       For the Three Months Ended   Description   January 31, 2023     January 31, 2022   Revenues:                         B2B   $ 4,224,457       39 %   $ 3,380,830       38 % B2C     6,553,222       61 %     5,496,275       62   Total   $ 10,777,679       100 %   $ 8,877,105       100 %   The following is a summary of cost of goods sold (COGS) by geographic region, for the indicated periods (as a percentage of total cost of goods sold):       For the Three Months Ended   Description   January 31, 2023     January 31, 2022   COGS:                         Asia Pacific   $ 3,201,410       38 %   $ 2,546,024       37 % UK     5,133,235       62 %     4,306,978       63 % Total   $ 8,334,645       100 %   $ 6,853,002       100 %     32 Table of Contents   The following is a summary of cost of goods sold by products for the indicated periods (as a percentage of total cost of goods sold):       For the Three Months Ended   Description   January 31, 2023     January 31, 2022   COGS:                         B2B   $ 3,201,410       38 %   $ 2,546,024       37 % B2C     5,133,235       62 %     4,306,978       63 % Total   $ 8,334,645       100 %   $ 6,853,002       100 %   Long-lived assets by geographic region as of the dates indicated below were as follows:        As of     As of   Description   January 31, 2023     October 31, 2022   Long-lived assets:             Asia Pacific   $ 261,502     $ 222,690   UK     12,683,191                 12,837,095   Latin America     224,173       222,678   Total   $ 13,168,866     $ 13,282,463     Note 14 - Income Taxes   United States of America (USA)   The Company has sufficient tax net operating losses to offset the current net income which results in $0 tax liability for the USA operations.   United Kingdom (UK)   For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company had income tax expense in the amount of $ 145,686
attributable to its operations of RKings and GMG Assets in the United Kingdom.   The Company, through RKings and GMG Assets, conducts a significant amount of its businesses in the United Kingdom and is subject to tax in this jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities, the Company files tax returns that are subject to examination by the local tax authority. Although the operations in its segments outside of the United Kingdom generate net income, the Company has sufficient tax net operating losses to offset the current net income which results in $ 0
tax liability for the non-United Kingdom operations.   The Company, through RKings and GMG Assets, is subject to a statutory tax rate of approximately
19 % of net income generated in the United Kingdom.   As a result of the acquisition of RKings, the Company assumed the income tax liability of RKings as of November 1, 2021 of $ 602,628 . No income tax liability was assumed from GMG Assets.   Balance November 1, 2021   $ 602,628   Income Tax November 1, 2021 through October 31, 2022     419,049   Income Tax November 1, 2022 through January 31, 2023     145,686   Tax paid     ( 549,697 ) Currency Adjustment     ( 122,358 ) Income Tax Liability   $ 495,308       33 Table of Contents   As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, the Company had UK income tax payable of $ 495,308

The Company believes that we are not exposed to matters that will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Notwithstanding the above, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.   The Company is in dispute with Mr. Paul Hardman (one of the sellers of RKings) with regards to the Holdback Amount of $ 573,000
that he has alleged is still owed to him, and which we alleged was forfeited. That amount is accrued and included in the Company’s liabilities as of January 31, 2023. The Company’s dispute and claims against Mr. Hardman stem from breaches of the terms of the Purchase Agreement by Mr. Hardman. The Company is vigorously pursuing the claim of breach of the Purchase Agreement against Mr. Hardman; however, at this point, no formal legal action has been initiated by either party to date.   Operating Lease Commitments :   In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under such guidance, lessees are required to recognize all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) on the balance sheet as a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The new standard was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early application permitted. The new standard was adopted using a modified retrospective approach.
On June 1, 2021, the Company (through GTG) entered into a three-year term lease agreement for office space and two parking spaces which commenced on June 1, 2021. The Company has the option to renew the lease for a period of three years. The rent is $ 117,857
($167,338 AUD) per year (subject to a 4% annual increase).
The Company does not have any finance leases. The operating lease cost for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $ 26,279 .
As of January 31, 2023, the Company recognized $ 140,153
of operating lease right-of-use asset and $ 107,050
of current operating lease liability and $ 37,733  of non-current operating lease liability. The discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of January 31, 2022 was
6.25 %. The discount rates are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.
34 Table of Contents   Note 16 - Purchase Agreement   Meridian Purchase Agreement:   On January 11, 2023, the Company entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement of Share Capital (the “ Meridian Purchase Agreement ”) with Aleksandar Milovanovic, Zoran Milosevic (“ Milosevic ”) and Snezana Bozovic (collectively, the “ Meridian Sellers ”), the owners of Meridian Tech Društvo Sa Ograničenom Odgovornošću Beograd, a private limited company formed and registered in and under the laws of the Republic of Serbia (“ Meridian Serbia ”); Društvo Sa Ograničenom Odgovornošću “ Meridianbet ” Društvo Za Proizvodnju, Promet Roba I Usluga, Export Import Podgorica, a private limited company formed and registered in and under the laws of Montenegro; Meridian Gaming Holdings Ltd., a company formed and registered in the Republic of Malta; and Meridian Gaming (Cy) Ltd, a company formed and registered in the republic of Cyprus (collectively, the “ Meridian Companies ”).   Pursuant to the Meridian Purchase Agreement, the Meridian Sellers agreed to sell us 100% of the outstanding capital stock of each of the Meridian Companies in consideration
for (a) a cash payment of $50 million, due at the initial closing of the acquisition; (b) 56,999,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Phase 1 Closing Shares”), with an agreed upon value of $3.50 per share; (c) 1,000 shares of a to be designated series of Series C preferred stock of the Company, discussed in greater detail below (the “Series C Voting Preferred Stock”); (d) $10,000,000 in cash and 4,285,714 restricted shares of Company common stock (the “Post-Closing Shares”) within five business days following the six month anniversary of the Phase 1 Closing (defined below) if (and only if) the Company has determined that: the Meridian Sellers and their affiliates are not then in default in any of their material obligations, covenants or representations under the Meridian Purchase Agreement, or any of the other transaction documents entered into in connection therewith (the “Post-Closing Consideration”); (e) a promissory note in the amount of $10,000,000 (the “Promissory Note”), due nine months after the Phase 1 Closing; and (f) 4,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock payable at the Phase 2 Closing (defined below)(the “Phase 2 Shares”) . The Phase 1 Closing Shares, Series C Preferred Stock, Post-Closing Shares and Phase 2 Shares, are collectively defined herein as the “ Purchase Shares ”.   The Purchase is contemplated to close in two phases, with phase 1 being the purchase of 100% of each of the Meridian Companies other than Meridian Serbia, together with 90% of Meridian Serbia (“ Phase 1 Closing ”); and phase 2 being the purchase of the remaining 10% of Meridian Serbia (“ Phase 2 Closing ”). The Phase 1 Closing is required to occur prior to June 30, 2023 and the Phase 2 Closing is required to occur prior to October 31, 2023, unless extended by the mutual consent of the parties.   The closing of the Purchase is subject to certain closing conditions (some of which apply only for the Phase 1 Closing and some of which apply for both the Phase 1 Closing and Phase 2 Closing). The Meridian Purchase Agreement can be terminated (a) by the written agreement of the parties; (b) by the Company or the Meridian Sellers if the Company has not obtained a loan commitment or other long-form term sheet from a third-party lender approved by Meridian Sellers (in their reasonable discretion) to provide at least $ 50
million of financing required for the Company to complete the Purchase (the “ Required Financing ”), on terms and conditions acceptable to Meridian Sellers in their reasonable discretion, prior to May 31, 2023 (or such other date as the parties may mutually agree), unless such failure is due to the such party that proposes to terminate the agreement not using commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy such condition or the breach by such party of a provision of the Meridian Purchase Agreement; (c) by the Company if the Shareholder Agreements are not entered into within 45 days after the date of the Meridian Purchase Agreement (February 25, 2023, provided that the parties have verbally agreed to extend such date), unless such failure is due to such party that proposes to terminate the agreement not using commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy such condition or the breach by such party of a provision of the Meridian Purchase Agreement; (d) by the Company or the Meridian Sellers if the Phase 1 Closing has not been completed by June 30, 2023 (unless such date is extended with the mutual consent of the parties)(the “ Required Closing Date ”) unless such failure is due to such party that proposes to terminate the agreement not using commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy such condition or the breach by such party of a provision of the Meridian Purchase Agreement; (e) by the Company or the Meridian Sellers, if a condition to closing has become incapable of fulfilment and not been waived by Purchaser; (f) by the Company or the Meridian Sellers pursuant to the Due Diligence Termination Right (defined below); (g) by either the Company or the Meridian Sellers if any updated schedule required to be disclosed pursuant to the terms of the Meridian Purchase Agreement could reasonably result in a material adverse effect on the disclosing party; (h) by either the Company or the Meridian Sellers if more than 90 days have elapsed since the date the initial required notices are provided under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the “ HSR Act ”), to the extent required, and HSR Act approval has not been received as of such date, and the Company or Meridian Sellers, as applicable, has made the reasonable, good faith determination that HSR Act approval will be so costly and time consuming to such party that it does not make commercially reasonable sense for such party to continue to seek such HSR Act approval; or (i) by either the Meridian Sellers or the Company, if there has been a breach of any material representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, or undertaking made by the other party in a transaction document, which breach, if curable, is not cured within 30 calendar days after notice by the non-breaching party (provided, however, that if the cure reasonably requires more than 30 days to complete, then the breaching party shall have an additional 15 days, provided it timely commences the cure and continues diligently prosecuting the cure to completion).     35 Table of Contents   The Meridian Purchase Agreement may also be terminated by the Meridian Sellers or the Company at any time prior to the Phase 1 Closing Date if: (i) there shall be any actual action or proceeding which value is more than 1% of the Purchase Price, before any court or any governmental entity which shall seek to restrain, prohibit, or invalidate the transactions contemplated by the Meridian Purchase Agreement and which, in the judgment of the Meridian Sellers or the Company, made in good faith and based upon the advice of its legal counsel, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Purchase; or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by the Meridian Purchase Agreement are disapproved by any regulatory authority whose governmental approval is required to consummate such transactions (which does not include the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)) or in the judgment of the Meridian Sellers or the Company, made in good faith and based on the advice of counsel, there is substantial likelihood that any such governmental approval will not be obtained by the Required Closing Date) or will be obtained only on a condition or conditions which would be unduly and materially burdensome, making it inadvisable to proceed with the Purchase.   In the event of termination of the Meridian Purchase Agreement, no obligation, right or liability shall arise, and each party shall bear all of the expenses incurred by it in connection with the negotiation, drafting, and execution of the Meridian Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, except in connection with the Break-Fee (discussed below).   Additionally, we have agreed to issue $ 3
million in restricted stock units to employees of the Meridian Companies (and their subsidiaries) within 30 days following the Phase 1 Closing in order to incentive such employees to continue to provide services to such entities following the Phase 1 Closing (the “ Post-Closing Equity Awards ”). The Post-Closing Equity Awards will be issued under a shareholder approved equity plan. Included in Post-Closing Equity Awards will be the award of Restricted Stock Units to the directors nominated for appointment to the Board of Directors by the holders of the Company’s Series C Voting Preferred Stock, as described in greater detail in the Meridian Purchase Agreement.   Pursuant to the Meridian Purchase Agreement we agreed to file a proxy statement with the SEC (the “ Proxy Statement ”) to seek shareholder approval for the issuance of the Purchase Shares, under applicable rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market, and adoption of amended and restated Articles of Incorporation (the “ Amended and Restated Articles ”) to remove our classified board of directors and amend certain other provisions of our Articles of Incorporation (collectively, the “ Charter Amendments ”), promptly after the Meridian Sellers have delivered the financial statements required by Regulation S-X for filing in such Proxy Statement, and to hold a stockholders meeting promptly thereafter (subject to applicable law), to seek shareholder approval of the Charter Amendments and the issuance of the Purchase Shares. We are also required to hold a shareholder meeting to seek shareholder approval for the issuance of the Purchase Shares and Charter Amendments promptly after the SEC has confirmed that it has no comments on such Proxy Statement (the “ Shareholder Approval ”).   The Meridian Purchase Agreement includes a 60 day due diligence period during which the Company has the right, at the Company’s election, in its reasonable discretion, to terminate the Meridian Purchase Agreement if the Company determines in good faith, that such due diligence has revealed information which would constitute a material adverse effect on the Meridian Companies, or results in any of the representations or warranties of the Meridian Sellers set forth in the Meridian Purchase Agreement not being materially correct and true and the Meridian Sellers have the same right (the “ Due Diligence Termination Right ”).   To the extent that any term sheet, letter of intent or other agreement or understanding relating to the Required Financing includes any break-fee, termination fee, or other expenses payable by the Company upon termination thereof, to the proposed lender, financier, investment bank or agent (each a “ Break-Fee ”), despite the parties’ best efforts to avoid such a requirement, each of the Company and Meridian Sellers shall be responsible for 50% of any such Break-Fee, including any amounts required to be escrowed in connection therewith.     36 Table of Contents   Promissory Note   The $ 10
million Promissory Note will accrue interest at
7 % per annum (18% upon the occurrence of an event of default), with monthly interest payments of accrued interest due on the first day of each calendar month until its maturity date; and have a maturity date nine months after the Phase 1 Closing. The Promissory Note will include customary events of default and require us to indemnify the holders thereof against certain claims.   Series C Voting Preferred Stock   The Series C Voting Preferred Stock is expected to have the following rights to be set forth in a designation of the Series C Voting Preferred Stock filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada prior to the Phase 1 Closing (the “ Series C Designation ”):   Voting Rights . The holders of the Series C Voting Preferred Stock, voting as a class, vote together with the holders of the Company’s common stock on all shareholder matters.
At each vote, each share of Series C Voting Preferred Stock entitles the holder 7,500 votes on all matters presented to the Company’s shareholders for a vote of shareholders, whether such vote is taken in person at a meeting or via a written consent (7,500,000 votes in aggregate for all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock) .   Additionally, for so long as the Company’s Board of Directors has at least five members and for so long as the Series C Preferred Stock is outstanding, the Series C Voting Preferred Stock, voting separately, will have the right to appoint two members to the Company’s Board of Directors. If the Company’s Board of Directors shall have less than five members, the Series C Voting Preferred Stock, voting separately, will have the right to appoint one member to the Board of Directors. The holders of the Series C Voting Preferred Stock will also have the sole right to remove such persons solely appointed by the Series C Voting Preferred Stock and to fill vacancies in such appointees.   The Series C Preferred Stock will also require the consent of the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock to (i) amend any provision of the designation of the Series C Preferred Stock, (ii) increase or decrease (other than by redemption or conversion) the total number of authorized shares of any preferred stock of the Company, (iii) adopt or authorize any new designation of any preferred stock, (iv) amend the Articles of Incorporation of the Company in a manner which adversely affects the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series C Preferred Stock, (v) effect an exchange, or create a right of exchange, cancel, or create a right to cancel, of all or any part of the shares of another class of shares into shares of Series C Preferred Stock, (vi) issue any additional shares of preferred stock, or (vii) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock so as to affect adversely the shares of Series C Preferred Stock.   Conversion Rights . The holders of the Series C Preferred Stock will have the right to convert each share of the Series C Preferred Stock into one share of the Company’s common stock at any time. The Series C Preferred Stock also provides for the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock into common stock of the Company, on a 1 for 1 basis, on the date that the aggregate beneficial ownership of the Company’s common stock (calculated pursuant to Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), calculated without regard to any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, of the Meridian Sellers (collectively), falls below 10% of the Company’s common stock then outstanding, without taking into account the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, or the first business day thereafter that the Company becomes aware of such.   Transfer Rights . The Series C Preferred Stock is not transferrable by the Meridian Sellers.   Note 17 – Subsequent Events   The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were issued for disclosure purposes.

Accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results and forecasts.   OVERVIEW   We operate (i) as an innovative provider of enterprise Software-as-a-Service (“ SaaS ”) solutions for online casino operators and online sports betting operators, commonly referred to as iGaming operators and, (ii) a provider of pay to enter prize competitions in the United Kingdom (UK), through RKingsCompetitions Ltd. and GMG Assets Limited and (iii) an online casino in Mexico through Golden Matrix MX, S.A. DE C.V.    We have historically operated in the B2B segment where we develop and own online gaming intellectual property (IP) and build configurable and scalable, turn-key and white-label gaming platforms for our international customers, located primarily in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region. With the acquisitions of RKingsCompetitions Ltd. (effective November 1, 2021 as to 80% and effective November 4, 2022, as to the remaining 20%) and GMG Assets (effective on August 1, 2022), we entered into the business-to-consumer (“ B2C ”) segment by offering pay to enter prize competitions throughout the UK.  Also, in the B2C segment, on July 11, 2022, the Company acquired Golden Matrix MX, S.A. DE C.V., which had no assets or operations at the time of acquisition and was formed for the benefit of the Company, for the sole purpose of operating an online casino in Mexico, named Mexplay, which is planned to feature an extensive number of table games, slots, as well as sportsbook, and offers tournament competition prizes similar to those offered by RKings. The Company’s online casino and related activities in Mexico have not yet commenced as the online casino and website is still under development and enhancements to the online casino are still ongoing, and marketing efforts in connection with the online casino have not yet started.     39 Table of Contents   B2B Segment   Our customers are primarily gaming Distributors and licensed online gaming operators. The Company also provides services and resells third party gaming content to licensed online gaming distributors and gaming operators. The Company provides business-to-business services and products and does not deal directly with players.   We derive revenues primarily from licensing fees received from gaming operators, in most cases via gaming Distributors located in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region that utilize the Company’s technology.   As of January 31, 2023, our systems had over 7.2 million registered players and a total of more than 710 unique casino and live game operations within all of our platforms including our GM-X, GM-Ag, Turnkey Solution, and White Label Solutions.   The Company’s goal is to expand our customer base globally and to integrate additional operators, launch additional synergistic products and appoint more Distributors.
As described above, our core markets are currently the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region and while we have a solid customer base; we are continuing to engage new gaming Distributors and gaming operators on a regular basis and we anticipate that our current gaming Distributors and gaming operators will continue to grow.   B2C Segment   Our B2C segment customers are primarily located in Northern Ireland and we have expanded our marketing efforts to attempt to reach customers throughout the U.K. As of January 31, 2023, RKings has over 279,000 registered users. GMG Assets has completed over 29 transactions since November 1, 2022, representing $1,215,516 in revenues and $46,489 in net income.
We derive revenues primarily from selling prize competitions tickets directly to customers for prizes throughout the United Kingdom ranging from automobiles to jewelry as well as travel and entertainment experiences and plan in the future to generate revenues from our online casino in Mexico, Mexplay, which is expected to feature an extensive number of table games, slots, as well as sportsbook, and offer tournament competition prizes similar to those offered by RKings. The Company’s online casino and related activities in Mexico have not yet commenced as the online casino and website is still under development and enhancements to the online casino are still ongoing, and marketing efforts in connection with the online casino have not yet started.   Our objective in managing our resources is to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and meet our growth objectives while maximizing returns to shareholders. Liquidity is necessary to meet (i) the working capital needs of our operations, (ii) fund our growth and expansion plans, and (iii) consummate strategic acquisitions (including the recently disclosed Meridian Purchase Agreement). We have met, and plan to continue to meet, our cash requirements through our operations and sales of equity securities. As to the funding of strategic acquisitions, we may issue debt in addition to raising funds through the sales of the Company’s capital stock.   The Company’s financial performance is subject to global, Asia Pacific, UK and Mexico economic conditions and their impact on levels of spending by consumers and customers, particularly discretionary spending for entertainment, gaming and leisure activities. Economic recessions may have adverse consequences across industries, including the global entertainment and gaming industries, which may adversely affect the Company’s business and financial condition. As a result of rising interest rates and inflation, there is substantial uncertainty about the strength of the global, Asia Pacific, UK and Mexico economies, which may currently or in the near term be in a recession and have experienced rapid increases in uncertainty about the pace of potential recovery. In addition, changes in general market, economic and political conditions in domestic and foreign economies or financial markets, including fluctuation in stock markets resulting from, among other things, trends in the economy, and increases in inflation and interest rates, as are being currently experienced, may reduce users’ disposable income and/or lead to recessions.
We believe that our business will continue to be resilient through a continued economic downturn or recession, or slowing or stalled recovery therefrom, and that we have the liquidity to address the Company’s financial obligations and alleviate possible adverse effects on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.     40 Table of Contents   Key elements of our growth strategy include:     · Supporting our existing customers as they scale up their respective iGaming and online sportsbook operations. As our customers’ businesses grow, we intend to deploy additional resources to develop the GM-X and GM-Ag Systems’ platform functionality, expand our gaming content portfolios by integrating additional third-party content providers, and seek to obtain additional regulatory approvals to operate in other global markets. The GM-X and GM-Ag Systems’ turn-key solution (including modular, configurable and scalable gaming platforms), is a complete software package for starting an online gaming business, incorporating all the tools and gaming content necessary to run an online Casino and/or Sportsbook and offers a full suite of tools and features for successfully operating and maintaining an online gaming website; from player registration to user management and content management. · Expanding our global reach by securing new gaming distributors, casino and sportsbook operator customers in existing and newly regulated markets.   · Investing in sales and marketing initiatives to aggressively pursue new deployment opportunities in developing markets such as Africa and Latin America, as well as exploring opportunities in the U.S.   · Investing in sales and marketing initiatives to drive UK and Mexican customers to the respective RKings and Mexplay platforms.
· Expanding the prizes and prize options available to customers on the RKings and Mexplay platforms.   · Developing and deploying our own proprietary gaming content in both casino iGaming as well as E-sport categories, provided that this project is currently on hold until further notice.
· Pursuing acquisitions of synergistic companies and assets with the goal of expanding our competitive position in the markets in which we operate, including the recently announced Meridian Purchase Agreement, which transaction we are currently working to close. We are also exploring the opportunity to selectively acquire independent slot development studios in order to launch our own proprietary games on our platform.
The Company does not intend to make significant investments (except for potential acquisitions, none of which are currently pending other than the pending Meridian Purchase Agreement discussed below) to support our business growth strategy. We believe that our business model is highly scalable and our existing resources can be leveraged to (i) develop new offerings and features, (ii) enhance our existing platform, and (iii) improve our operating infrastructure.   The Company may face significant costs with respect to legal fees incurred in the applications for licenses, continued regulatory requirements, and legal representation.   To acquire complementary businesses and technologies, we may need to pursue equity or debt financing to secure additional funds, and we are currently seeking debt funding in connection with the acquisition contemplated by the Meridian Purchase Agreement. Our ability to obtain additional capital will depend on our business plans, investor demand, our operating performance, capital markets conditions and other factors. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our then issued and outstanding equity or debt, and our existing shareholders may experience dilution. If we are unable to obtain additional capital when required, or on satisfactory terms, our ability to continue to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.   We may acquire other businesses, and our business may be detrimentally affected if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our company or otherwise manage the growth associated with multiple acquisitions.   As part of our business strategy, we intend to make acquisitions of new or complementary businesses, products, brands, or technologies, including pursuant to the pending Meridian Purchase Agreement. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial, including as a result of professional fees and due diligence efforts. There is no assurance that the time and resources expended on pursuing a particular acquisition will result in a completed transaction, or that any completed transaction will ultimately be successful. In addition, we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition or strategic investment opportunities or may be unable to obtain the required financing or regulatory approvals, and therefore we may be unable to complete such acquisitions or strategic investments on favorable terms. We may pursue acquisitions that our investors may not agree with, and we cannot assure investors that any acquisition or investment will be successful or otherwise provide a favorable return on investment. In addition, if we fail to successfully close transactions, integrate new technology or operational teams, or integrate the products and technologies associated with these acquisitions into our company, our business could be seriously harmed.     41 Table of Contents   Cash requirements   The Company is self-sustaining, and its cash needs for ongoing operations are met through current operations; as of January 31, 2023, the cash balance is $15,423,897. There are no current expected future cash demands or commitments other than ongoing operations for the following next 12 months and beyond, provided that the Company has entered into the Meridian Purchase Agreement, as discussed below, which will require the Company to raise additional funding and the Company may acquire additional businesses or assets in the future, which acquisitions may require additional capital.   As discussed in greater detail in “NOTE 16 - PURCHASE AGREEMENT”, in the notes to the financial statements included under “ Item 1. Financial Statements ”, on January 11, 2023, the Company entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement of Share Capital (the “ Meridian Purchase Agreement ”) with Aleksandar Milovanovic, Zoran Milosevic (“ Milosevic ”) and Snezana Bozovic (collectively, the “ Meridian Sellers ”), the owners of Meridian Tech Društvo Sa Ograničenom Odgovornošću Beograd, a private limited company formed and registered in and under the laws of the Republic of Serbia (“ Meridian Serbia ”); Društvo Sa Ograničenom Odgovornošću “ Meridianbet ” Društvo Za Proizvodnju, Promet Roba I Usluga, Export Import Podgorica, a private limited company formed and registered in and under the laws of Montenegro; Meridian Gaming Holdings Ltd., a company formed and registered in the Republic of Malta; and Meridian Gaming (Cy) Ltd, a company formed and registered in the republic of Cyprus (collectively, the “ Meridian Companies ”).
Pursuant to the Meridian Purchase Agreement, the Meridian Sellers agreed to sell us 100% of the outstanding capital stock of each of the Meridian Companies in consideration for (a) a cash payment of $50 million, due at the initial closing of the acquisition; (b) 56,999,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock (the “ Phase 1 Closing Shares ”), with an agreed upon value of $3.50 per share; (c) 1,000 shares of a to be designated series of Series C preferred stock of the Company (the “ Series C Voting Preferred Stock ”); (d) $10,000,000 in cash and 4,285,714 restricted shares of Company common stock (the “Post-Closing Shares”) within five business days following the six month anniversary of the Phase 1 Closing (defined below) if (and only if) the Company has determined that: the Meridian Sellers and their affiliates are not then in default in any of their material obligations, covenants or representations under the Meridian Purchase Agreement, or any of the other transaction documents entered into in connection therewith (the “ Post-Closing Consideration ”); (e) a promissory note in the amount of $10,000,000 (the “ Promissory Note ”), due nine months after the Phase 1 Closing; and (f) 4,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock payable at the Phase 2 Closing(the “ Phase 2 Shares ”).
The Purchase is contemplated to close in two phases, with phase 1 being the purchase of 100% of each of the Meridian Companies other than Meridian Serbia, together with 90% of Meridian Serbia (“ Phase 1 Closing ”); and phase 2 being the purchase of the remaining 10% of Meridian Serbia (“ Phase 2 Closing ”). The Phase 1 Closing is required to occur prior to June 30, 2023 and the Phase 2 Closing is required to occur prior to October 31, 2023, unless extended by the mutual consent of the parties.
The Company is actively pursuing funding sources to meet the cash payment requirements described above, which are summarized below, as discussed in greater detail under “ Capital Resources ”, below:
Description   Amount   Cash due at the Phase 1 Closing   $ 50,000,000   Cash due 5 days after the six-month anniversary of the Phase 1 Closing (i.e., the payment of the Note)   $ 10,000,000   Note due nine months after the Phase 1 Closing   $ 10,000,000   Total   $ 70,000,000     As discussed below, to the extent the Meridian Purchase Agreement c loses, we will need to raise $70 million to pay the amounts summarized below, including $50 million at the Phase 1 Closing.   Liquidity   There are no known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the Company’s liquidity decreasing in any material way. As previously noted, the Company is self-sustaining through its operations and therefore is not considering additional sources of liquidity, except in connection with the Meridian Purchase Agreement, described above and below; however, the Company may consider raising funds through debt, private placements, or additional public offerings for expansion of operations or synergetic acquisitions if additional external funds are sought. Sources of liquid assets, as of January 31, 2023, include cash of $15,423,897, receivables of $3,489,673 and inventory of $1,612,975, with offsetting liabilities (current and long-term) of $3,866,696.      42 Table of Contents   Capital Resources
The Company does not have material cash requirements for its ongoing operations other than a possible holdback payment of approximately $573,000 (GBP 500,000) as part of the hold-back on the 80% acquisition of RKings that was completed effective November 1, 2021.  The hold-back is contested by the Company and currently subject to ongoing claims. With a cash balance of $15,423,897 and operations that are self-sustaining, the contested obligation to pay the aforementioned holdback of $573,000 may be met without burdening the Company.
We do not currently have any additional commitments or identified sources of additional capital from third parties or from our officers, directors or majority stockholders. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.   The Company is actively pursuing funding sources to meet the cash requirements for the Meridian Purchase Agreement described above in “ Overview -
Cash requirements ”
of which the initial $50 million is due at the Phase 1 Closing. We plan to raise this funding through the sale of debt; however, we have not entered into any loan agreements regarding such funding to date, and such funding may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If debt financing is available and obtained, our interest expense may increase and we may be subject to the risk of default, depending on the terms of such financing. If equity financing is available and obtained it may result in our shareholders experiencing significant dilution. If such financing is unavailable, we may be unable to complete the acquisition of the Meridian Companies.   Assuming we successfully complete the acquisition of the Meridian Companies, it is expected the combined operations of the Company and Meridian will continue to be self-sustaining through their respective operations with minimal impact on liquidity.   In the future, we may be required to seek additional capital by selling additional debt or equity securities, or otherwise be required to bring cash flows in balance when we approach a condition of cash insufficiency. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if accomplished, may result in dilution to our then stockholders. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In the event we are unable to raise additional funding and/or obtain revenues sufficient to support our expenses, we may be forced to scale down our operations, which could cause our securities to decline in value.
Our historical primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations, along with debt and equity financing and available cash and cash equivalents. Our primary use of this liquidity is to fund ongoing cash requirements, including our working capital needs, capital investments, and acquisitions. As previously mentioned, we believe that the cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next 12 months and beyond, including investments made and expenses incurred in connection with system development, marketing initiatives, and inventory purchase.
EBITDA – Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation Amortization   In addition to our results calculated under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we also present EBITDA below. EBITDA is a “non-GAAP financial measure” presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance. It is not presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses EBITDA as a metric of profits and successful operations management. In particular, we use EBITDA as a milestone for the purposes of certain incentive compensation programs applicable to some of our officers and directors, in order to evaluate our company’s performance and determine whether certain restricted stock units vest as of the end of October 31, 2023 and 2024. EBITDA means net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation. EBITDA should be viewed as supplemental to, and not as an alternative for net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP.   EBITDA is presented because we believe it provides additional useful information to investors due to the various noncash items during the period. EBITDA is also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. EBITDA is unaudited, and has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future or contractual commitments; EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, capital expenditures or working capital needs; EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments; although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. In addition, other companies in this industry may calculate EBITDA differently than the Company does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. The Company’s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure, below. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in their entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view non-GAAP measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.     43 Table of Contents   Reconciliation of EBITDA to Net income (loss):       Three Months Period Ended       January 31, 2023     January 31, 2022   Net income (loss)   $ (443,521 )   $ 413,671   + Interest expense     998       -   - Interest income     (11,905 )     (441 ) + Taxes     145,686       75,404   + Depreciation     9,897       2,532   + Amortization     106,666       94,169   + Stock-based compensation     1,081,784       143,931   EBITDA   $ 889,605     $ 729,266     Recent Material Events   Meridian Purchase Agreement:   On January 11, 2023, the Company entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement of Share Capital (the “ Meridian Purchase Agreement ”) with Aleksandar Milovanovic, Zoran Milosevic (“ Milosevic ”) and Snezana Bozovic (collectively, the “ Meridian Sellers ”), the owners of Meridian Tech Društvo Sa Ograničenom Odgovornošću Beograd, a private limited company formed and registered in and under the laws of the Republic of Serbia (“ Meridian Serbia ”); Društvo Sa Ograničenom Odgovornošću “ Meridianbet ” Društvo Za Proizvodnju, Promet Roba I Usluga, Export Import Podgorica, a private limited company formed and registered in and under the laws of Montenegro; Meridian Gaming Holdings Ltd., a company formed and registered in the Republic of Malta; and Meridian Gaming (Cy) Ltd, a company formed and registered in the republic of Cyprus (collectively, the “ Meridian Companies ”).   Pursuant to the Meridian Purchase Agreement, the Meridian Sellers agreed to sell us 100% of the outstanding capital stock of each of the Meridian Companies in consideration for (a) a cash payment of $50 million, due at the initial closing of the acquisition; (b) 56,999,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock (the “ Phase 1 Closing Shares ”), with an agreed upon value of $3.50 per share; (c) 1,000 shares of a to be designated series of Series C preferred stock of the Company, discussed in greater detail below (the “ Series C Voting Preferred Stock ”); (d) $10,000,000 in cash and 4,285,714 restricted shares of Company common stock (the “Post-Closing Shares”) within five business days following the six month anniversary of the Phase 1 Closing (defined below) if (and only if) the Company has determined that: the Meridian Sellers and their affiliates are not then in default in any of their material obligations, covenants or representations under the Meridian Purchase Agreement, or any of the other transaction documents entered into in connection therewith (the “ Post-Closing Consideration ”); (e) a promissory note in the amount of $10,000,000 (the “ Promissory Note ”), due nine months after the Phase 1 Closing; and (f) 4,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock payable at the Phase 2 Closing (defined below)(the “ Phase 2 Shares ”). The Phase 1 Closing Shares, Series C Preferred Stock, Post-Closing Shares and Phase 2 Shares, are collectively defined herein as the “ Purchase Shares ”.   The Purchase is contemplated to close in two phases, with phase 1 being the purchase of 100% of each of the Meridian Companies other than Meridian Serbia, together with 90% of Meridian Serbia (“ Phase 1 Closing ”); and phase 2 being the purchase of the remaining 10% of Meridian Serbia (“ Phase 2 Closing ”). The Phase 1 Closing is required to occur prior to June 30, 2023, and the Phase 2 Closing is required to occur prior to October 31, 2023, unless extended by the mutual consent of the parties.     44 Table of Contents   The closing of the Purchase is subject to certain closing conditions (some of which apply only for the Phase 1 Closing and some of which apply for both the Phase 1 Closing and Phase 2 Closing). The Meridian Purchase Agreement can be terminated (a) by the written agreement of the parties; (b) by the Company or the Meridian Sellers if the Company has not obtained a loan commitment or other long-form term sheet from a third-party lender approved by Meridian Sellers (in their reasonable discretion) to provide at least $50 million of financing required for the Company to complete the Purchase (the “ Required Financing ”), on terms and conditions acceptable to Meridian Sellers in their reasonable discretion, prior to May 31, 2023 (or such other date as the parties may mutually agree), unless such failure is due to such party that proposes to terminate the agreement not using commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy such condition or the breach by such party of a provision of the Meridian Purchase Agreement; (c) by the Company if the Shareholder Agreements are not entered into within 45 days after the date of the Meridian Purchase Agreement (February 25, 2023, provided that the parties have verbally agreed to extend such date), unless such failure is due to such party that proposes to terminate the agreement not using commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy such condition or the breach by such party of a provision of the Meridian Purchase Agreement; (d) by the Company or the Meridian Sellers if the Phase 1 Closing has not been completed by June 30, 2023 (unless such date is extended with the mutual consent of the parties)(the “ Required Closing Date ”) unless such failure is due to such party that proposes to terminate the agreement not using commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy such condition or the breach by such party of a provision of the Meridian Purchase Agreement; (e) by the Company or the Meridian Sellers, if a condition to closing has become incapable of fulfilment and not been waived by Purchaser; (f) by the Company or the Meridian Sellers pursuant to the Due Diligence Termination Right (defined below); (g) by either the Company or the Meridian Sellers if any updated schedule required to be disclosed pursuant to the terms of the Meridian Purchase Agreement could reasonably result in a material adverse effect on the disclosing party; (h) by either the Company or the Meridian Sellers if more than 90 days have elapsed since the date the initial required notices are provided under the HSR Act, to the extent required, and HSR Act approval has not been received as of such date, and the Company or Meridian Sellers, as applicable, has made the reasonable, good faith determination that HSR Act approval will be so costly and time consuming to such party that it does not make commercially reasonable sense for such party to continue to seek such HSR Act approval; or (i) by either the Meridian Sellers or the Company, if there has been a breach of any material representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, or undertaking made by the other party in a transaction document, which breach, if curable, is not cured within 30 calendar days after notice by the non-breaching party (provided, however, that if the cure reasonably requires more than 30 days to complete, then the breaching party shall have an additional 15 days, provided it timely commences the cure and continues diligently prosecuting the cure to completion).   The Meridian Purchase Agreement may also be terminated by the Meridian Sellers or the Company at any time prior to the Phase 1 Closing Date if: (i) there shall be any actual action or proceeding which value is more than 1% of the Purchase Price, before any court or any governmental entity which shall seek to restrain, prohibit, or invalidate the transactions contemplated by the Meridian Purchase Agreement and which, in the judgment of the Meridian Sellers or the Company, made in good faith and based upon the advice of its legal counsel, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Purchase; or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by the Meridian Purchase Agreement are disapproved by any regulatory authority whose governmental approval is required to consummate such transactions (which does not include the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)) or in the judgment of the Meridian Sellers or the Company, made in good faith and based on the advice of counsel, there is substantial likelihood that any such governmental approval will not be obtained by the Required Closing Date) or will be obtained only on a condition or conditions which would be unduly and materially burdensome, making it inadvisable to proceed with the Purchase.   In the event of termination of the Meridian Purchase Agreement, no obligation, right or liability shall arise, and each party shall bear all of the expenses incurred by it in connection with the negotiation, drafting, and execution of the Meridian Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, except in connection with the Break-Fee (discussed below).   Additionally, we have agreed to issue $3 million in restricted stock units to employees of the Meridian Companies (and their subsidiaries) within 30 days following the Phase 1 Closing in order to incentive such employees to continue to provide services to such entities following the Phase 1 Closing (the “ Post-Closing Equity Awards ”). The Post-Closing Equity Awards will be issued under a shareholder approved equity plan. Included in Post-Closing Equity Awards will be the award of Restricted Stock Units to the directors nominated for appointment to the Board of Directors by the holders of the Company’s Series C Voting Preferred Stock, as described in greater detail in the Meridian Purchase Agreement.   Pursuant to the Meridian Purchase Agreement, we agreed to file a proxy statement with the SEC (the “ Proxy Statement ”) to seek shareholder approval for the issuance of the Purchase Shares, under applicable rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market, and adoption of amended and restated Articles of Incorporation (the “ Amended and Restated Articles ”) to remove our classified board of directors and amend certain other provisions of our Articles of Incorporation (collectively, the “ Charter Amendments ”), promptly after the Meridian Sellers have delivered the financial statements required by Regulation S-X for filing in such Proxy Statement, and to hold a stockholders meeting promptly thereafter (subject to applicable law), to seek shareholder approval of the Charter Amendments and the issuance of the Purchase Shares. We are also required to hold a shareholders meeting to seek shareholder approval for the issuance of the Purchase Shares and Charter Amendments promptly after the SEC has confirmed that it has no comments on such Proxy Statement (the “ Shareholder Approval ”).     45 Table of Contents   The Meridian Purchase Agreement includes a 60 day due diligence period during which the Company has the right, at the Company’s election, in its reasonable discretion, to terminate the Meridian Purchase Agreement if the Company determines in good faith, that such due diligence has revealed information which would constitute a material adverse effect on the Meridian Companies, or results in any of the representations or warranties of the Meridian Sellers set forth in the Meridian Purchase Agreement not being materially correct and true and the Meridian Sellers have the same right (the “ Due Diligence Termination Right ”).   To the extent that any term sheet, letter of intent or other agreement or understanding relating to the Required Financing includes any break-fee, termination fee, or other expenses payable by the Company upon termination thereof, to the proposed lender, financier, investment bank or agent (each a “ Break-Fee ”), despite the parties’ best efforts to avoid such a requirement, each of the Company and Meridian Sellers shall be responsible for 50% of any such Break-Fee, including any amounts required to be escrowed in connection therewith.   Promissory Note   The $10 million Promissory Note will accrue interest at 7% per annum (18% upon the occurrence of an event of default), with monthly interest payments of accrued interest due on the first day of each calendar month until its maturity date; and have a maturity date nine months after the Phase 1 Closing. The Promissory Note will include customary events of default and require us to indemnify the holders thereof against certain claims.   Series C Voting Preferred Stock   The Series C Voting Preferred Stock is expected to have the following rights to be set forth in a designation of the Series C Voting Preferred Stock filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada prior to the Phase 1 Closing (the “ Series C Designation ”):   Voting Rights . The holders of the Series C Voting Preferred Stock, voting as a class, vote together with the holders of the Company’s common stock on all shareholder matters. At each vote, each share of Series C Voting Preferred Stock entitles the holder 7,500 votes on all matters presented to the Company’s shareholders for a vote of shareholders, whether such vote is taken in person at a meeting or via a written consent (7,500,000 votes in aggregate for all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock).   Additionally, for so long as the Company’s Board of Directors has at least five members and for so long as the Series C Preferred Stock is outstanding, the Series C Voting Preferred Stock, voting separately, will have the right to appoint two members to the Company’s Board of Directors. If the Company’s Board of Directors shall have less than five members, the Series C Voting Preferred Stock, voting separately, will have the right to appoint one member to the Board of Directors. The holders of the Series C Voting Preferred Stock will also have the sole right to remove such persons solely appointed by the Series C Voting Preferred Stock and to fill vacancies in such appointees.   The Series C Preferred Stock will also require the consent of the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock to (i) amend any provision of the designation of the Series C Preferred Stock, (ii) increase or decrease (other than by redemption or conversion) the total number of authorized shares of any preferred stock of the Company, (iii) adopt or authorize any new designation of any preferred stock, (iv) amend the Articles of Incorporation of the Company in a manner which adversely affects the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series C Preferred Stock, (v) effect an exchange, or create a right of exchange, cancel, or create a right to cancel, of all or any part of the shares of another class of shares into shares of Series C Preferred Stock, (vi) issue any additional shares of preferred stock, or (vii) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock so as to affect adversely the shares of Series C Preferred Stock.   Conversion Rights . The holders of the Series C Preferred Stock will have the right to convert each share of the Series C Preferred Stock into one share of the Company’s common stock at any time. The Series C Preferred Stock also provides for the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock into common stock of the Company, on a 1 for 1 basis, on the date that the aggregate beneficial ownership of the Company’s common stock (calculated pursuant to Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), calculated without regard to any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, of the Meridian Sellers (collectively), falls below 10% of the Company’s common stock then outstanding, without taking into account the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, or the first business day thereafter that the Company becomes aware of such.   Transfer Rights . The Series C Preferred Stock is not transferrable by the Meridian Sellers.     46 Table of Contents   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Three months ended January 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended January 31, 2022.   Revenues   The Company currently has three distinctive revenue streams.   1) the Company charges gaming operators for the use of its unique intellectual property (IP) and technology systems. Revenues derived from such charges were based on the usage of the systems by the clients. During the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company generated $189,381 of revenues from its unique IP and technology systems, including $186,643 from Articulate Pty Ltd (“ Articulate ”), a related party, which is wholly-owned by Anthony Brian Goodman, CEO and Chairman of the Company and his wife Marla Goodman. During the three months ended January 31, 2022, the Company generated $238,127 of revenues from its IP and technology systems, including $235,246 which was from Articulate.   The decrease of $48,746 in IP gaming revenues in the three-month period ended January 31, 2023, compared to the three-month period ended January 31, 2022, is due to the Company’s shift in focus to appointing resellers of the third-party gaming content, reduction in reliance on related parties, and the Company’s aim to expand the product into additional global jurisdictions. The decrease in revenue is attributed to a highly competitive environment. The Company has taken steps to mitigate the effect of the aforementioned decrease by expanding its global presence and broadening its product offerings which has already resulted in an increase in alternate revenue streams as discussed below.   2) Since June 2020, the Company has contracted with certain clients to offer third party gaming content and as such become a reseller of this gaming content. Revenues derived from the reselling of gaming content during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $4,035,076 and $3,142,703, respectively.
The increase of $892,373 in revenues in the three-month period ended January 31, 2023 relating to third party gaming content, compared to the three-month period ended January 31, 2022, is attributable to an increased number of customers and registered players with our customers.
3) The Company generates revenues from sales of prize competitions tickets directly to customers for prizes throughout the United Kingdom ranging from automobiles to jewelry as well as travel and entertainment experiences. In addition, prize winners may elect to accept the cash value of a prize instead of accepting the prize.  The cash value of the prize is less than the actual value of the prize.  If the cash value is accepted, GMG Assets purchases the prize from the prize winner and then sells the prize in the market, which has historically generated a profit on the sale.  During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, revenues from prize competitions were $6,553,222 and $5,496,275, respectively which included $1,215,516 and $0, respectively of revenues which were derived from facilitating cash alternative offers for winners of prizes within RKings’ business (the Company did not have revenues from facilitating cash alternative offers for winners of prizes during the three-month period ended January 31, 2022, as it acquired GMG Assets effective on August 1, 2022). The increase of $1,056,947 in revenues in the three-month period ended January 31, 2023 relating to sales of prize competitions tickets, compared to the three-month period ended January 31, 2022, is mainly attributable to the revenues derived from facilitating cash alternative offers.
Total revenues for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 are $10,777,679 and $8,877,105, respectively.     47 Table of Contents   Cost of goods sold   The Company currently has three distinctive sources of cost of goods sold.   1) The Company recognizes the value of stock options granted to consultants under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan as cost of goods sold. These stock options directly contributed to the revenue generated by the Company’s GM2 Asset. During the three months January 31, 2023 and 2022, cost of goods sold due to the amortization of options was $120,054 and $137,931, respectively. The decrease in the cost of goods sold was due to some stock options which were fully amortized in the prior fiscal year.
2) The cost of usage of the third-party content is recognized as a cost of goods sold. During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, cost of goods sold due to the usage of gaming content was $3,081,356 and $2,408,093, respectively. The increase of $673,263 in cost of goods sold from the resale of gaming content in the three-month period ended January 31, 2023, compared with the three months ended January 31, 2022, was attributable to the increased usage of gaming content as a result of an increased number of customers and registered players with our customers.   3) The Company incurs cost of goods sold due to the prizes purchased which are awarded to winners of RKings’ prize competitions throughout the United Kingdom, ranging from automobiles to jewelry as well as travel and entertainment experiences. During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, cost of goods sold due to prizes purchased to be awarded in the prize competitions was $5,133,235 and $4,306,978, respectively. The increase of $826,257 in cost of goods sold from the resale of gaming content in the three-month period ended January 31, 2023, compared with the three months ended January 31, 2022, was mainly attributable to the costs related to facilitating cash alternative offers, as discussed above.   Total costs of goods sold for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $8,334,645 and $6,853,002, respectively.   Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin   We had gross profit of $2,443,034 for the three months ended January 31, 2023, compared to gross profit of $2,024,103 for the three months ended January 31, 2022, an increase of $418,931 from the prior period, mainly due to the $230,690 increase in gross profit contributed from the B2C segment, due to the operations of RKings and GMG Assets. An increase of gross profit of $188,241 in the B2B segment was mainly due to the increase in revenues as discussed above.   Gross profit margin was 23% for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and the three months ended January 31, 2022. The gross profit margin on the B2B segment was approximately 24% for the three months ended January 31, 2023, compared to 23% for the three months ended January 31, 2022. The gross profit margin on the B2C segment was approximately 22% for the three months ended January 31, 2023, compared to 22% for the three months ended January 31, 2022.
Moving forward, the Company expects to consolidate several operating aspects that are redundant and plans to seek to generate increased gross profit and gross profit margin due to economies of scale. Also, the competition prizes are expected to generate larger profit margins with a focus on increasing the margins on individual prizes.   General and administrative expenses   During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, general and administrative expenses were $2,037,295 and $1,464,545, respectively. General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of stock-based compensation, advertising and promotion expenses, travel expenses, website maintenance expenses, payroll expenses, office expenses, bank charges, commission expenses, lease expenses, gaming license expenses, depreciation, amortization expense, professional fees and research and development expense.
The increase of general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the increased stock-based compensation expense of $438,834 for employees and consultants, incentive shares earned, and increased marketing costs and payroll costs in the B2B segment.     48 Table of Contents   General and administrative expenses – Related parties   General and administrative expenses from related parties consisted primarily of stock-based compensation, consulting expenses and salary expenses payable to the Company’s Management and Directors. During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, general and administrative expenses from related parties were $734,694 and $155,600, respectively. The components of general and administrative expenses from related parties are as follows:       Three months ended
January 31,       2023     2022   Stock-based compensation
$ 522,896     $ -   Consulting and salary expenses     211,798       155,600   Total   $ 734,694     $ 155,600     During the three-month period ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the stock-based compensation increased due to the amortization of the RSUs issued to the Company’s Directors in the last fiscal year; the consulting and salary expenses increased mainly due to the increased compensation to the Company’s officers.
Interest expense   During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, interest expense was $998 and $0, respectively. The interest expense was due to interest accrued on the Company’s credit card balance.
Interest income   Interest income was attributable to the interest from the bank savings. During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, interest income was $11,905 and $441, respectively. The increase in interest income was mainly due to the increase in interest rates.
Foreign exchange gain
The foreign exchange gain was due to the fluctuation of the Euro, British Pound and Mexican Peso, against the US dollar, and as a result of certain suppliers billing the Company in Euros, and settlement of other liabilities in currencies other than US dollars. During the three months ended January 31, 2023, foreign exchange gain was $20,213, compared to $84,676 for the three months ended January 31, 2022. The decrease of foreign exchange gain was mainly due to the depreciation of US dollars against other currencies, in which the Company has liabilities.
Provision for income taxes   The provision for income taxes was $145,686 for the three months ended January 31, 2023, compared to $75,404 for the three months ended January 31, 2022. The increase was attributable to the tax expenses incurred in the B2C segment in UK.   Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest   For the three months ended January 31, 2022, we recorded net income of $64,292, attributable to the noncontrolling interest, compared to no net income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest for the three months ended January 31, 2023. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the three months ended January 31, 2022 was due to the acquisition of an 80% interest in RKingsCompetition Ltd, effective on November 1, 2021. These amounts represent the share of income that is not attributable to the Company. Effective as of November 4, 2022, the Company acquired the remaining 20% interest of RKings and as such, the Company now owns 100% of RKings; therefore, noncontrolling interest for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $0.     49 Table of Contents
Net income (loss) attributable to the Company
The Company had net loss attributable to the Company of $443,521 and net income attributable to the Company of $349,379 for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in net income attributable to the Company of $792,900 was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation of $937,853; which increase in costs was offset by increase in gross profit of $418,931, each as discussed in greater detail above.     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       As of January 31,     As of October 31,       2023     2022   Cash and cash equivalents   $ 15,423,897     $ 14,949,673   Working capital   $ 17,385,256     $ 16,573,796   Shareholders’ equity of GMGI   $ 30,516,389     $ 26,797,415     The Company had $15,423,897 of cash on hand at January 31, 2023 and total assets of $34,383,085 ($21,214,219 of which were current assets) and total working capital of $17,385,256 as of January 31, 2023. Included in total assets at January 31, 2023 was $10,381,710 of goodwill associated with the Company’s interest in RKingsCompetition Ltd. and $2,200,000 in intangible assets related to trademarks and non-compete agreements.
The Company had $14,949,673 of cash on hand at October 31, 2022 and total assets of $32,571,413 ($19,288,950 of which were current assets) and total working capital of $16,573,796 as of October 31, 2022. Included in total assets of October 31, 2022 was $10,452,324 of goodwill associated with the Company’s interest in RKingsCompetition Ltd. and $2,280,000 of intangible assets related to trademarks and non-compete agreements.   The increase in cash of $474,224 between January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, was mainly due to cash generated by operating activities.       50 Table of Contents   Except as discussed above under “ Overview - Cash Requirements ” and “ Overview- Capital Resources ” in connection with the pending Meridian Purchase Agreement, there are no known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the Company’s liquidity decreasing in any material way.  We do not currently have any additional commitments or identified sources of additional capital from third parties or from our officers, directors or majority shareholders. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.   In the future, we may be required to seek additional capital, including in connection with the Meridian Purchase Agreement, as discussed above, by selling additional debt or equity securities, or otherwise be required to bring cash flows in balance when we approach a condition of cash insufficiency. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if accomplished, may result in dilution to our then shareholders. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In the event we are unable to raise additional funding and/or obtain revenues sufficient to support our expenses, we may be forced to scale down our operations, which could cause our securities to decline in value.   See “ NOTE 3 – ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE – RELATED PARTY ”, for a description of related party accounts receivable; “ NOTE 7 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS – SOFTWARE PLATFORM, WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT COSTS, TRADEMARKS AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENTS ”, for a description of the Company’s intangible assets; “ NOTE 8 – ACCOUNTS PAYABLE – RELATED PARTIES ”, for a description of related party accounts payable; and “ NOTE 11 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS ”, for a description of related party transactions, each included herein in the notes to the financial statements included under “ Item 1. Financial Statements. ”       Three Months Ended January 31,       2023     2022   Cash provided by operating activities   $ 401,653     $ 1,841,399   Cash used in investing activities     (60,923 )     (3,395,318
) Cash provided by financing activities     -       200     Cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2023, include stock-based compensation, amortization expenses on intangible assets, and unrealized foreign exchange gain on contingent liability.
The Company generated cash from operating activities of $401,653 during the three months ended January 31, 2023, due primarily to non-cash expenses relating to stock-based compensation of $1,081,784 (including RSUs and options issued for services of $818,395, and stock issued for services of $263,389), depreciation and amortization of $116,563, and $626,252 of increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, offset by $443,521 of net loss, $820,054 of increase in accounts receivable, and $378,170 of increase in inventory, prize. Cash from operating activities of $1,841,399 during the three months ended January 31, 2022, was due primarily to $413,671 of net income, non-cash expenses relating to stock-based compensation of $143,931 (including options issued for services of $137,931, and stock issued for services of $6,000), depreciation and amortization of $96,701, $773,290 of decrease in accounts receivable from related party, and $126,983 of increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.   During the three months ended January 31, 2023, cash used in investing activities was $60,923 which was primarily due to a $52,788 payment related to website development costs. During the three months ended January 31, 2022, cash used in investing activities was $3,395,318 which was primarily due to the cash consideration paid to acquire an 80% interest in RKingsCompetition Ltd of $3,341,453.   During the three months ended January 31, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was $0. During the three months ended January 31, 2022 cash provided by financing activities was $200, which was due to an advance from shareholders to open Company bank accounts.     51 Table of Contents   The Company had a net increase in cash of $474,224 for the three months ended January 31, 2023, which is mostly attributable to cash provided by operating activities of $401,653, offset by cash used in investing activities of $60,923, as discussed above.   Material Events and Uncertainties   RKings Purchase – Holdback Amount In Dispute:   The Company has an ongoing dispute with Mr. Paul Hardman (one of the sellers of RKings) with regards to the Holdback Amount of $573,000 that he has alleged is still owed to him, and which we alleged was forfeited. That amount is accrued and included in the Company’s liabilities as of January 31, 2023. The Company’s dispute and claims against Mr. Hardman stem from breaches of the terms of the Purchase Agreement by Mr. Hardman. The Company is vigorously pursuing the claim of breach of the Purchase Agreement against Mr. Hardman; however, at this point, no formal legal action has been initiated by either party to date.   Our operating results are difficult to forecast. Our prospects should be evaluated in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties commonly encountered by comparable development stage companies.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   The discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated unaudited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these unaudited financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates past judgments and estimates, including those related to bad debts, accrued liabilities, goodwill and contingencies. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The accounting policies and related risks described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022, filed with the Commission on January 30, 2023 are those that depend most heavily on these judgments and estimates. As of January 31, 2023, there had been no material changes to any of the critical accounting policies contained therein. “ NOTE 2 -- SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ” of the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022, filed with the Commission on January 30, 2023, describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting estimates include transactions, assets, liabilities and obligations that are stated in foreign local currency and their conversion to US currency. Resulting loss on currency conversions related to assets and liabilities is recognized in shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and realized foreign currency translation adjustments are recognized in other income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.   Item 3. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (§ 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a “ smaller reporting company, ” as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).   Item 4. Controls and Procedures   Disclosure controls and procedures   The Company’s Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial/accounting officer) have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of January 31, 2023. Based upon such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act, is recorded properly, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.      52 Table of Contents   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended January 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures   In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.     53 Table of Contents   PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1. Legal Proceedings   Although we may, from time to time, be involved in litigation and claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business, we are not currently a party to any material legal proceeding. In addition, we are not aware of any material legal or governmental proceedings against us or contemplated to be brought against us. The impact and outcome of litigation, if any, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We believe the ultimate resolution of any such current proceeding will not have a material adverse effect on our continued financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   Item 1A. Risk Factors   There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022, filed with the Commission on January 30, 2023 (the “ Form 10-K ”), under the heading “ Risk Factors ”, and investors should review the risks provided in the Form 10-K, prior to making an investment in the Company. The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described in the Form 10-K, under “ Risk Factors ”, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial conditions and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.   Item 2.
