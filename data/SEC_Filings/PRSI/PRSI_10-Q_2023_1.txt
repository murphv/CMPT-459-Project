NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
NOTE
1 –
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The
condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Portsmouth Square, Inc. (“Portsmouth” or
the “Company”), according to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in the condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes
the disclosures that are made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Further, the condensed consolidated financial
statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which included only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a
fair statement of the financial position, cash flows and results of operations as of and for the periods indicated. It is suggested that
these financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of Portsmouth and the notes therein included
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. The June 30, 2022 condensed consolidated balance
sheet was derived from the consolidated balance sheet as included in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022.
The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are not
necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.
Portsmouth’s
primary business was conducted through its general and limited partnership interest in Justice Investors Limited Partnership, a California
limited partnership (“Justice” or the “Partnership”). Effective July 15, 2021, Portsmouth completed the purchase
of
100 % of the limited partnership interest of Justice through the acquisition of the remaining
0.7 % non-controlling interest. Effective
December 23, 2021, the Partnership was dissolved. The financial statements of Justice were consolidated with those of the Company.
Prior
to its dissolution effective December 23, 2021, Justice owned and operated a 544-room hotel property located at 750 Kearny Street, San
Francisco California, known as the Hilton San Francisco Financial District (the “Hotel”) and related facilities including
a five-level underground parking garage through its subsidiaries Justice Operating Company, LLC (“Operating”) and Justice
Mezzanine Company, LLC (“Mezzanine”). Mezzanine was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership; Operating is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Mezzanine. Effective December 23, 2021, Portsmouth replaced Justice as the single member of Mezzanine. Mezzanine is the
borrower under certain mezzanine indebtedness of Justice, and in December 2013, the Partnership conveyed ownership of the Hotel to Operating.
The Hotel is a full-service Hilton brand hotel pursuant to a Franchise License Agreement with HLT Franchise Holding LLC (“Hilton”)
through January 31, 2030.
Operating
entered into a hotel management agreement (“HMA”) with Aimbridge Hospitality (“Aimbridge”) to manage the Hotel,
along with its five-level parking garage, with an effective date of February 3, 2017. The term of the management agreement is for an
initial period of
ten years
commencing on the February 3, 2017 date and
automatically renews for successive one (1) year periods, not
to exceed five years in the aggregate, subject to certain conditions.
Under the terms on the HMA, base management fee payable to Aimbridge
shall be one and seven-tenths percent ( 1.70 %) of total Hotel revenue.
As
of December 31, 2022, The InterGroup Corporation (“InterGroup”), a public company, owns approximately
75.6 % of the outstanding
common shares of Portsmouth and the Company’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, John V. Winfield, owns approximately
2.5 % of the outstanding common shares of the Company. Mr. Winfield also serves as the President, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer of InterGroup and owns approximately
68 % of the outstanding common shares of InterGroup as of December 31, 2022.

There
have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the six months ended December 31, 2022. Please
refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022 for a summary of the significant accounting
policies. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation on the condensed consolidated
balance sheet. Finance leases $ 183,000
as of June 30, 2022, and accounts payable - Hotel of $ 8,307,000
as of June 30, 2022, respectively,
were reclassified to Accounts Payable and Other Liabilities. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations
and financial position.
Recently
Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
As
of December 31, 2022, management does not expect a material impact from recently issued accounting pronouncements yet to be adopted,
on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
NOTE
2 -
LIQUIDITY
Historically,
our cash flows have been primarily generated from our Hotel operations. However, the responses by federal, state, and local civil authorities
to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a material detrimental impact on our liquidity. For the six months ended December 31, 2022,
our net cash provided by operating activities was $ 976,000 . We have taken several steps to preserve capital and increase liquidity at
our Hotel, including implementing strict cost management measures to eliminate non-essential expenses, renegotiating certain reoccurring
expenses, and temporarily closing certain hotel services and outlets. As the hospitality and travel environment continues to recover,
we will continue to evaluate what services we bring back. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company continued to make
capital improvements to the hotel in the amount of $ 2,682,000
and anticipates continuing its guest room upgrade program during the remaining
of fiscal year 2023.
The
Company had cash and cash equivalents of $ 1,236,000
and $ 2,662,000
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company
had restricted cash of $ 4,784,000
and $ 6,226,000
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company had marketable
securities, net of margin due to securities brokers, of $ 302,000
and $ 411,000
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
These marketable securities are short-term investments and liquid in nature.
On
December 16, 2020, Justice and InterGroup entered into a loan modification agreement which increased Justice’s borrowing from
InterGroup as needed up to $ 10,000,000
and extended the maturity date of the loan to
July
31, 2021 . As of the date of this report, the maturity date was extended to
July
31, 2023 . On September 7, 2021, the Board of InterGroup passed resolution to provide funding to Portsmouth for the working
capital of the Hotel up to $ 16,000,000
if necessary. Upon the dissolution of Justice in December 2021, Portsmouth assumed
Justice’s note payable to InterGroup in the amount of $ 11,350,000 .
On December 31, 2021, Portsmouth and InterGroup entered into a loan modification agreement which memorialized the increase to $ 16,000,000
and the substitution of Portsmouth for Justice. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, InterGroup advanced $ 7,550,000
to the Hotel, bringing the total amount due to InterGroup to $ 14,200,000
as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. Currently, the Company does not anticipate any need for additional funding from
InterGroup. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not made any pay-downs to its note payable to InterGroup. The Company could
amend its by-laws and increase the number of authorized shares to issue additional shares to raise capital in the public markets if
needed.
The
Company’s known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures,
including management and franchise fees, corporate expenses, payroll and related costs, taxes, interest and principal payments on our
outstanding indebtedness, and repairs and maintenance of the Hotel.
Our
long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities and capital improvements of
the Hotel. We will continue to finance our business activities primarily with existing cash, including from the activities described
above, and cash generated from our operations. After considering our approach to liquidity and accessing our available sources of cash,
we believe that our cash position will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures, including corporate
expenses, payroll and related benefits, taxes and compliance costs and other commitments, for at least twelve months from the date of
issuance of these financial statements, even if current levels of occupancy and revenue per occupied room (“RevPAR”, calculated
by multiplying the hotel’s average daily room rate by its occupancy percentage) were to persist. The objectives of our cash management
policy are to maintain existing leverage levels and the availability of liquidity, while minimizing operational costs. However, there
can be no guarantee that management will be successful with its plan.

Performance
obligations
We
identified the following performance obligations for which revenue is recognized as the respective performance obligations are satisfied,
which results in recognizing the amount we expect to be entitled to for providing the goods or services:
●
Cancelable room reservations or ancillary services
are typically satisfied as the good or service is transferred to the hotel
guest, which is generally when the room stay occurs.
●
Non-cancelable room reservations and banquet or conference reservations
represent a series of distinct goods or services provided
over time and satisfied as each distinct good or service is provided, which is reflected by the duration of the room reservation.
●
Other ancillary goods and services
are purchased independently of the room reservation at standalone selling prices and are considered
separate performance obligations, which are satisfied when the related good or service is provided to the hotel guest.
●
Components of package reservations
for which each component could be sold separately to other hotel guests are considered separate
performance obligations and are satisfied as set forth above.
Hotel
revenue primarily consists of hotel room rentals, revenue from accommodations sold in conjunction with other services (e.g., package
reservations), food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services (e.g., parking). Revenue is recognized when rooms are occupied
or goods and services have been delivered or rendered, respectively. Payment terms typically align with when the goods and services are
provided. For package reservations, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations within the package based on the
estimated standalone selling prices of each component.
-
10
-
We
do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an expected length of one year or less. Due to the
nature of our business, our revenue is not significantly impacted by refunds. Cash payments received in advance of guests staying at
our hotel are refunded to hotel guests if the guest cancels within the specified time before any services are rendered. Refunds related
to service are generally recognized as an adjustment to the transaction price at the time the hotel stay occurs or services are rendered.
Contract
assets and liabilities
We
do not have any material contract assets as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, other than trade and other receivables, net on our
condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our receivables are primarily the result of contracts with customers, which are reduced by an
allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects our estimate of amounts that will not be collected.
We
record contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of guests staying at our hotel, which are presented within

On December 16, 2020, Justice and
InterGroup entered into a loan modification agreement which increased Justice’s borrowing from InterGroup as needed up to
$ 10,000,000
and extended the maturity date of the loan to July 31, 2021. As of the date of this report, the maturity date was extended to July
31, 2023. On September 7, 2021, the Board of InterGroup passed resolution to provide funding to Portsmouth for the working capital
of the Hotel up to $ 16,000,000
if necessary. Upon the dissolution of Justice in December 2021, Portsmouth assumed Justice’s
note payable to InterGroup in the amount of $ 11,350,000 .
On December 31, 2021, Portsmouth and InterGroup entered into a loan modification agreement which memorialized the increase to $ 16,000,000
and the substitution of Portsmouth for Justice. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, InterGroup advanced $ 7,550,000
to the
Hotel, bringing the total amount due to InterGroup to $ 14,200,000
as of June30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. Currently, the Company does not anticipate any need for additional funding
from InterGroup. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not made any pay-downs to its note payable to InterGroup. The Company could
amend its by-laws and increase the number of authorized shares to issue additional shares to raise capital in the public markets if needed.
Note
payable to Hilton (Franchisor) is a self-exhausting, interest free development incentive note which is reduced by approximately $ 317,000
annually
through 2030
by Hilton if the Partnership is still a Franchisee with Hilton.
On
February 1, 2017, Operating entered into an HMA with Ambridge to manage the Hotel with an effective takeover date of February 3, 2017.
The term of the management agreement is for an initial period of
10
years commencing on the takeover date and automatically renews for
an additional year not to exceed five years in aggregate subject to certain conditions. The HMA also provides for Ambridge to advance
a key money incentive fee to the Hotel for capital improvements in the amount of $ 2,000,000
under certain terms and conditions described
in a separate key money agreement. The key money contribution shall be amortized in equal monthly amounts over an eight ( 8 ) year period
commencing on the second anniversary of the takeover date. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Hotel obtained approval
from Ambridge to use the key money for hotel operations and the funds were exhausted by December 31, 2020. The unamortized portion of
$ 1,021,000

To
fund the redemption of limited partnership interests and to repay the prior mortgage of $ 42,940,000 , Justice obtained a $ 97,000,000
mortgage
loan and a $ 20,000,000
mezzanine loan in December 2013. The
10 -year mortgage loan is secured by the Company’s principal asset,
the Hotel. The mortgage loan bears an interest rate of
5.275 % per annum with interest only payments due through January 2017.
Beginning
in February 2017, the loan began to amortize over a thirty-year period through its maturity date of January 2024 . Outstanding principal
balance on the loan was $ 88,135,000
and $ 89,114,000
as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. As additional security for
the mortgage loan, there is a limited guaranty executed by Portsmouth in favor of the mortgage lender.
The mezzanine loan is secured
by the Operating membership interest held by Mezzanine and is subordinated to the Mortgage Loan. The mezzanine interest only loan had
an interest rate of
9.75 % per annum and a maturity date of January 1, 2024 . As additional security for the mezzanine loan, there is a
limited guaranty executed by Portsmouth in favor of the mezzanine lender. On July 31, 2019, Mezzanine refinanced the mezzanine loan by
entering into a new mezzanine loan agreement (“New Mezzanine Loan Agreement”) with Cred Reit Holdco LLC in the amount of
$ 20,000,000 . The prior Mezzanine Loan which had a
9.75 % per annum interest rate was paid off. Interest rate on the new mezzanine loan
is
7.25 % and the loan matures on
January 1, 2024 . Interest only payments are due monthly.
Effective
May 11, 2017, InterGroup agreed to become an additional guarantor under the limited guaranty and an additional indemnitor under the environmental
indemnity for Justice Investors limited partnership’s $ 97,000,000
mortgage loan and the $ 20,000,000
mezzanine loan. Pursuant to
the agreement, InterGroup is required to maintain certain net worth and liquidity. As of December 31, 2022, InterGroup is in compliance
with both requirements. However, due to the Hotel’s ongoing recovery from the negative impact of Covid19 in the Hotel’s cash
flow, Operating has not been meeting certain of its loan covenants such as the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (“DSCR”) which
would trigger the creation of a lockbox by the Lender for all cash collected by the Hotel. However, such lockbox has been created and
utilized from the loan inception and will be in place up to loan maturity regardless of the DSCR.
The
Company’s Board of Directors is currently comprised of directors John V. Winfield, William J. Nance, John C. Love, and Steve Grunwald.
Director Jerold R. Babin, 90, passed away in October 2022 and was replaced by Yvonne Murphy. All the Company’s directors also serve
as directors of InterGroup. The Company’s director and Chairman of the Audit Committee, William J. Nance, serves as Comstock’s
director and Chairman of the Audit and Finance, Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees of Comstock.
John
V. Winfield serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company and InterGroup. Effective June 2016, Mr. Winfield became the
Managing Director of Justice until its dissolution in December 2021. Depending on certain market conditions and various risk factors,
the Chief Executive Officer and InterGroup may, at times, invest in the same companies in which the Company invests. The Company encourages
such investments because it places personal resources of the Chief Executive Officer and the resources of InterGroup, at risk in connection
with investment decisions made on behalf of the Company.
On
May 24, 2021, John V. Winfield resigned effective immediately as the Company’s President and the Company’s Board of Directors
elected David C. Gonzalez as the Company’s new President, effective as of May 24, 2021. Mr. Gonzalez serves as Vice President Real
Estate of InterGroup and is an advisor of the Executive Strategic Real Estate and Securities Investment Committee of InterGroup and Portsmouth.

You should not rely on forward-looking statements since they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are,

or future achievements or events.
Such

COVID19
UPDATE
The
novel strain of coronavirus and the disease it causes (“COVID-19”) have continued to affect the hospitality industry and
our business. Beginning in March 2020, travel restrictions and mandated closings of non-essential businesses were imposed, which resulted
in temporary suspensions of operations in many hotels in San Francisco, however, the Company did not suspend operations and did not close
the hotel. As vaccination rates across the country increased and COVID-19 related restrictions were eased or removed, we saw an increase
in travel and hospitality spending beginning in the second calendar quarter of 2021. During calendar year 2022, we continued to witness
robust leisure demand and an acceleration in group and business transient demand. However, the potential for an economic slowdown or
a recession during calendar year 2023 may disrupt the positive momentum at the Company’s hotel and our industry.
We
believe the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine during 2021 drove the improvement in traveler sentiment we experienced and resulted
in an improvement in occupancy, Average Daily Rate (“ADR”) and Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”) during 2021
and 2022. If additional virus variants emerge causing re-imposed widespread travel restrictions, the hospitality industry will be negatively
affected. While there can be no assurances that the Company will not experience further fluctuations in hotel revenues or earnings due
to the uncertainty of COVID-19 and other macroeconomic factors, such as inflation, increases in interest rates, potential economic slowdown
or a recession and geopolitical conflicts, we expect to continue to recover through the remainder of fiscal year 2023 based on current
demand trends.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
The
Company’s principal source of revenue continues to be derived from its ownership in Justice Operating Company, LLC (“Operating”)
inclusive of hotel room revenue, food and beverage revenue, garage revenue, and revenue from other operating departments. Operating owns
the Hotel and related facilities, including a five-level underground parking garage. The financial statements of Operating have been
consolidated with those of the Company.
Three
Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2021
The
Company had net loss of $1,320,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to net loss of $960,000 for the three months
ended December 31, 2021.
Hotel
Operations
The
Company had net loss from Hotel operations of $1,553,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to net loss of $602,000
for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increased loss is primarily attributable to the $2,000,000 gain on extinguishment of
debt recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2021 related to the full forgiveness of the PPP loan, offset by improved hotel
operations during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as the hospitality market continues its recovery.

For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, room revenues increased by $3,032,000, food and beverage revenue increased by $329,000 and
garage decreased by $51,000 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The year over year increase in all the revenue sources,
except for garage revenues which remained stable, are as a result of the recovery from the business interruption attributable to a variety
of responses by federal, state, and local civil authority to the COVID-19 outbreak since March 2020. Total operating expenses increased
by $2,247,000 due to increase in salaries and wages, commission, credit card fees, management fees, and franchise fees.

The
Company had a net gain on marketable securities of $107,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to a net loss on marketable
securities of $412,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a
net realized loss of $37,000 and a net unrealized gain of $144,000. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company had a net
realized loss of $2,095,000 and a net unrealized gain of $1,683,000. Gains and losses on marketable securities may fluctuate significantly
from period to period in the future and could have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations. However, the amount
of gain or loss on marketable securities for any given period may have no predictive value and variations in amount from period to period
may have no analytical value. For a more detailed description of the composition of the Company’s marketable securities see the
Marketable Securities section below.
The
Company consolidated Justice (“Hotel”) for financial reporting purposes and was not taxed on its non-controlling interest
in the Hotel. However, effective July 15, 2021, the Company become the owner of 100% of Justice and will include all the Hotel’s
income and expense accounts into its income taxes calculations going forward. The income tax benefit during the three months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021 represent the income tax effect on the Company’s pretax loss which includes the operations of the Hotel.

The
Company had net loss of $1,329,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to net loss of $2,935,000 for the six months ended
December 31, 2021. The change is primarily attributable to the increase in Hotel revenue.
Hotel
Operations
The
Company had net loss from Hotel operations of $1,238,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to net loss of $2,557,000
for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in loss is primarily attributed to the increased revenues as the hospitality
market continues to recover, offset by the gain on extinguishment of debt regarding the full forgiveness of the PPP loan recorded during
the period ended December 31, 2021.

FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
The
Company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $6,020,000 and $8,888,000 as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
The Company had marketable securities, net of margin due to securities brokers, of $302,000 and $411,000 as of December 31, 2022 and
June 30, 2022, respectively. These marketable securities are short-term investments and liquid in nature.
On
December 16, 2020, Justice and InterGroup entered into a loan modification agreement which increased Justice’s borrowing from InterGroup
as needed up to $10,000,000 and extended the maturity date of the loan to July 31, 2021. As of the date of this report, the maturity
date was extended to July 31, 2023. On September 7, 2021, the Board of InterGroup passed resolution to provide funding to Portsmouth
for the working capital of the Hotel up to $16,000,000 if necessary. Upon the dissolution of Justice in December 2021, Portsmouth assumed
Justice’s note payable to InterGroup in the amount of $11,350,000. On December 31, 2021, Portsmouth and InterGroup entered into
a loan modification agreement which memorialized the increase to $16,000,000 and the substitution of Portsmouth for Justice. During the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, InterGroup advanced $7,550,000 to the Hotel, bringing the total amount due to InterGroup to $14,200,000
as of June30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. Currently, the Company does not anticipate any need for additional funding from InterGroup.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not made any pay-downs to its note payable to InterGroup. The Company could amend its by-laws
and increase the number of authorized shares to issue additional shares to raise capital in the public markets if needed.
Our
known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures, including management
and franchise fees, corporate expenses, payroll and related costs, taxes, interest and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness,
and repairs and maintenance of the Hotel. Our long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled
debt maturities and capital improvements of the Hotel. We will continue to finance our business activities primarily with existing cash,
including from the activities described above, and cash generated from our operations. After considering our approach to liquidity and
accessing our available sources of cash, we believe that our cash position will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for operating
and other expenditures, including corporate expenses, payroll and related benefits, taxes and compliance costs and other commitments,
for at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, even if current levels of occupancy and revenue per
occupied room (“RevPAR”, calculated by multiplying the hotel’s average daily room rate by its occupancy percentage)
were to persist. The objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain existing leverage levels and the availability of liquidity,
while minimizing operational costs. However, there can be no guarantee that management will be successful with its plan.

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
The
Company has no material off balance sheet arrangements.
IMPACT
OF INFLATION
Hotel
room rates are typically impacted by supply and demand factors, not inflation, since rental of a hotel room is usually for a limited
number of nights. Room rates can be, and usually are, adjusted to account for inflationary cost increases. Since Aimbridge has the power
and ability under the terms of its management agreement to adjust Hotel room rates on an ongoing basis, there should be minimal impact
on partnership revenues due to inflation. For the two most recent fiscal years, the impact of inflation on the Company’s income
is not viewed by management as material.
CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Critical
accounting estimates are those that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require
judgments by management in order to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements.
We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to the consolidation of our subsidiaries, to our revenues, allowances
for bad debts, accruals, asset impairments, other investments, income taxes and commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The actual results may differ from these estimates
or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical
accounting policies or methods or assumptions during the six months ended December 31, 2022.
INCOME
TAXES
Judgment
is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or
tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws, or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject
to examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters
could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return
to determine whether they are more likely than not of being sustained, assuming that the tax reporting positions will be examined by
taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information, prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial
statements. If a position does not meet the more likely than not standard, the benefit cannot be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and
the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision
for income taxes. A change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard with respect to a position could materially
impact our consolidated financial statements. See Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 13
to our Consolidated Financial Statements” on Form 10K for the year ended June 30, 2022.
DEFERRED
INCOME TAXES – VALUATION ALLOWANCE
We
assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that
some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable. This assessment is completed by tax jurisdiction and relies on the weight
of both positive and negative evidence available, with significant weight placed on recent financial results. Cumulative pre-tax losses
for the three-year period are considered significant objective negative evidence that some or all of our deferred tax assets may not
be realizable. Cumulative reported pre-tax income is considered objectively verifiable positive evidence of our ability to generate positive
pre-tax income in the future. In accordance with GAAP, when there is a recent history of pre-tax losses, there is little or no weight
placed on forecasts for purposes of assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. When necessary, we use systematic and logical
methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse
and generate tax deductions. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required when scheduling the reversal of deferred tax
assets and liabilities, and the exercise is inherently complex and subjective. However, significant judgment will be required to determine
the timing and amount of any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods. See Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data — Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements” on Form 10K for the year ended June 30, 2022.
PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
We
evaluate property and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly, and when events or circumstances indicate
the carrying value may not be recoverable, we evaluate the net book value of the assets by comparing to the projected undiscounted cash
flows of the assets. We use judgment to determine whether indications of impairment exist and consider our knowledge of the hospitality
industry, historical experience, location of the property, market conditions, and property-specific information available at the time
of the assessment. The results of our analysis could vary from period to period depending on how our judgment is applied and the facts
and circumstances available at the time of the analysis. When an indicator of impairment exists, judgment is also required in determining
the assumptions and estimates to use within the recoverability analysis and when calculating the fair value of the asset or asset group,
if applicable. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting the judgments used could result in impairments to our long-lived
assets in future periods. Historically, changes in estimates used in the property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets
impairment assessment process have not resulted in material impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of changes made to those
estimates. There were no impairment losses recorded during the six months ended December 31, 2022.

4. Controls and Procedures
EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The
Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has
evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon such evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in this filing is accumulated and communicated
to management and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and forms.
CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There
have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the last quarterly period covered by this

INFORMATION
Item
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Portsmouth
Square, Inc., through its operating company Justice Investors Operating Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Company”),
is the owner of the real property located at 750 Kearny Street in San Francisco, currently improved with a 27 – story building
which houses a Hilton Hotel (the “Property”). The Property was improved pursuant to approvals granted by the City and County
of San Francisco (the “City”) in 1970. Those approvals included a Major Encroachment Permit (“Permit”) by which
the Company was required by the City to construct an ornamental overhead pedestrian bridge across Kearny Street, connecting the Property
to the City park and underground parking garage known as Portsmouth Square (the “Bridge”). The construction of the Bridge
was a condition of the City’s approval of the construction of the hotel structure on the Property. Effective on May 24, 2022, the
City has revoked the Permit and directed the Company to remove the Bridge at the Company’s expense, including construction management
costs and traffic control. Pursuant to a letter dated June 13, 2022, the City’s Department of Public works specifically directed
the “removal of the unpermitted pedestrian bridge and all related physical encroachments in the public right-of-way and on City
property” and the submission of a general bridge removal and restoration plan (the “Plan”). The Company disputes the
legality of the purported revocation of the Permit. The Company further disputes any obligation to remove the Bridge at its expense.
In particular, representatives of the Company participated in meetings with the City since August 1, 2019, discussing a collaborative
process for the possible removal of the Bridge. Until the recent revocation of the Permit in 2022, the City representatives repeatedly
and consistently promised and agreed that the City will pay for the associated costs of any Bridge removal. Nevertheless, without waiving
any rights, in an effort to understand all of the available options, and to provide a response to the City’s directives, the Company
has engaged a Project Manager, a structural engineering firm, an architect to advise on the process and for the development of a Plan
for the Bridge removal, as well as the reconstruction of the front of the Hilton Hotel and a legal team. The Plan is currently not expected
to be completed until early in 2023. At this time, early estimates of the cost of the Plan exceed $2 million. The Company is currently
in discussions with the City regarding both the process and financial responsibility for the implementation of the Plan for the Bridge
removal. Those discussions are expected to continue well into 2023.
The
Company may be subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company will defend
itself vigorously against any such claims. Management does not believe that the impact of such matters will have a material effect on
the financial conditions or result of operations when resolved.
