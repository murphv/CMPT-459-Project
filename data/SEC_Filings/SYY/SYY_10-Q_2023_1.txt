The financial statements include consolidated balance sheets, consolidated results of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in consolidated shareholders’ equity and consolidated cash flows. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments, except as otherwise disclosed, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in shareholders’ equity for all periods presented have been made. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2022. Certain footnote disclosures included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to applicable rules and regulations for interim financial statements. Supplemental Cash Flow Information The following table sets forth the company’s reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the amounts shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows: Dec. 31, 2022 Jan. 1, 2022 (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 500,340   $ 1,374,276   Restricted cash
(1) 85,306   60,614   Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows $ 585,646   $ 1,434,890   (1) Restricted cash primarily represents cash and cash equivalents of Sysco’s wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary, restricted for use to secure the insurer’s obligations for workers’ compensation, general liability and auto liability programs. Restricted cash is located within other assets in each consolidated balance sheet. 2.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Liabilities – Supplier Financing Programs In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-04, Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs, Subtopic 405-50, that requires entities to disclose in the annual financial statements the key terms of supplier finance programs they use in connection with the purchase of goods and services, along with information about their obligations under these programs, including a rollforward of those obligations. Additionally, the guidance requires disclosure of the outstanding amount of the obligations as of the end of each interim period. The guidance does not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of supplier finance program obligations. The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, which is the first quarter of fiscal 2024 for Sysco, except for the rollforward requirement, which is effective annually for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, which is fiscal year 2025 for Sysco. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance requires retrospective application to all periods in which a balance sheet is presented, except for the rollforward requirement, which will be applied prospectively. The company is currently reviewing the provisions of the new standard. 7 3.
REVENUE The company recognizes revenues when its performance obligations are satisfied in an amount that reflects the consideration Sysco expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods and services. Customer receivables, which are included in accounts receivable, less allowances in the consolidated balance sheet, was $ 4.6
billion as of both December 31, 2022 and July 2, 2022. Sysco has certain customer contracts in which upfront monies are paid to its customers. These payments have become industry practice and are not related to financing of the customer’s business. They are not associated with any distinct good or service to be received from the customer and, therefore, are treated as a reduction of transaction prices.

ACQUISITIONS During the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, the company paid cash of $ 37.7
million for several acquisitions. Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration that may include earnout agreements that are typically payable over periods of up to
three years
in the event that certain operating results are achieved. As of December 31, 2022, aggregate contingent consideration outstanding was $ 62.7
million, of which $ 59.2
million was recorded as earnout liabilities. Earnout liabilities are all measured using unobservable inputs that are considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. Greco and Sons On August 12, 2021, Sysco consummated its acquisition of Greco and Sons (Greco), a leading independent Italian specialty distributor in the United States, operating out of
10
distribution centers. Greco imports and distributes a full line of food and non-food products and manufactures specialty meat products. The acquisition also includes Bellissimo Foods Company, which distributes a broad selection of Italian and Mediterranean ingredients, including a proprietary branded line of products that are sold exclusively through the Bellissimo Foods Company distribution network, serving independent pizza and Italian restaurants. The purpose of the acquisition was to strengthen Sysco’s business within the Italian foodservice sector. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the company completed the determination of fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Greco acquisition.
The company recorded certain measurement period adjustments during each quarter of fiscal 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023, none of which were individually or in aggregate material to the company’s financial statements.
10 5.   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Sysco’s policy is to invest in only high-quality investments. The fair value of the company’s cash deposits and money market funds included in cash equivalents are valued using inputs that are considered a Level 1 measurement. Other cash equivalents, such as time deposits and highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less, are valued using inputs that are considered a Level 2 measurement.
The fair value of the company’s marketable securities are all measured using inputs that are considered a Level 2 measurement, as they rely on quoted prices in markets that are not actively traded or observable inputs over the full term of the asset. The location and the fair value of the company’s marketable securities in the consolidated balance sheet are disclosed in Note 6, “Marketable Securities.” The fair value of the company’s derivative instruments are all measured using inputs that are considered a Level 2 measurement, as they are not actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market quotations. The location and the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities designated as hedges in the consolidated balance sheet are disclosed in Note 7, “Derivative Financial Instruments.” The following tables present the company’s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and July 2, 2022:   Assets Measured at Fair Value as of Dec. 31, 2022   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total   (In thousands) Assets: Cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents $ 204,815   $ 5,011   $ —   $ 209,826   Other assets

The carrying values of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term maturities. The fair value of Sysco’s total debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the company for new debt with the same maturities as existing debt, and is considered a Level 2 measurement. The fair value of total debt was approximately $ 10.4
billion as of December 31, 2022 and $ 10.5
billion as of July 2, 2022, while the carrying value was $ 11.1
billion as of December 31, 2022 and $ 10.6
billion as of July 2, 2022.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES Sysco invests a portion of the assets held by its wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary in a restricted investment portfolio of marketable fixed income securities, which have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The company includes fixed income securities maturing in less than 12 months within prepaid expenses and other current assets and includes fixed income securities maturing in more than 12 months within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The company records the amounts at fair market value, which is determined using quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period.
Unrealized gains and any portion of a security’s unrealized loss attributable to non-credit losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. There were no significant credit losses recognized in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Sysco uses derivative financial instruments to enact hedging strategies for risk mitigation purposes; however, the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Hedging strategies are used to manage interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and fuel price risk. 12 Hedging of interest rate risk Sysco manages its debt portfolio with interest rate swaps from time to time to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates.
Hedging of foreign currency risk The company uses euro-bond denominated debt to hedge the foreign currency exposure of our net investment in certain foreign operations. Additionally, Sysco’s operations in Europe have inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than their functional currency, such as the euro, U.S. dollar, British pound sterling, Polish zloty and Danish krone. These inventory purchases give rise to foreign currency exposure between the functional currency of each entity and these currencies. The company enters into foreign currency forward swap contracts to sell the applicable entity’s functional currency and buy currencies matching the inventory purchase, which operate as cash flow hedges of the company’s foreign currency-denominated inventory purchases. Hedging of fuel price risk Sysco uses fuel commodity swap contracts to hedge against the risk of the change in the price of diesel on anticipated future purchases. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges. None of the company’s hedging instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features.
Details of outstanding hedging instruments as of December 31, 2022 are presented below: Maturity Date of the Hedging Instrument Currency / Unit of Measure Notional Value (In millions) Hedging of interest rate risk June 2023 Euro 500 Hedging of foreign currency risk Various (January 2023 to April 2023) Swedish Krona 266 Various (January 2023 to March 2023) British Pound Sterling 9 June 2023 Euro 500 Hedging of fuel risk Various (January 2023 to March 2025) Gallons 74 The location and the fair value of derivative instruments designated as hedges in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and July 2, 2022 are as follows:   Derivative Fair Value   Balance Sheet location Dec. 31, 2022 Jul. 2, 2022 (In thousands) Fair Value Hedges: Interest rate swaps Other current liabilities $ 6,391   $ 2,820   Cash Flow Hedges: Fuel swaps Other current assets $ 13,490   $ 47,170   Foreign currency forwards Other current assets 1,014   633   Fuel swaps Other assets 1,331   —   Fuel swaps Other current liabilities 1,303   —   Foreign currency forwards Other current liabilities 1   —   Fuel swaps Other long-term liabilities 1,638   209   13 Gains or losses recognized in the consolidated results of operations for cash flow hedging relationships are not significant for each of the periods presented.

COMPANY-SPONSORED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Sysco has company-sponsored defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans for its employees. Also, the company provides certain health care benefits to eligible retirees and their dependents. On October 25, 2022, the Sysco Corporation Retirement Plan (the Plan) executed an agreement with Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (the Insurer). Under this agreement, the Plan purchased a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract using Plan assets that transferred to the Insurer $ 695.0  million of the Plan’s defined benefit pension obligations related to certain pension benefits. The contract covers approximately
10,000
Sysco participants and beneficiaries (the Transferred Participants) in the U.S. pension plan (the U.S. Retirement Plan). Under the group annuity contract, the Insurer has made an unconditional and irrevocable commitment to pay the pension benefits of each Transferred Participant that are due on or after January 1, 2023. The transaction resulted in no changes to the amount of benefits payable to the Transferred Participants. As a result of the transaction, the company recognized a one-time, non-cash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $ 315.4  million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 primarily related to the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses included within accumulated other comprehensive loss in the statement of changes in consolidated shareholders’ equity. The transaction also required the company to remeasure the benefit obligations and plan assets of the U.S. Retirement Plan. The remeasurement
17 reflects the use of an updated discount rate and an expected rate of return on plan assets as of October 31, 2022, applying the practical expedient to remeasure plan assets and obligations as of the nearest calendar month-end date. Funded Status The following table presents the changes in benefit obligations and plan assets of the U.S. Retirement Plan affected by the interim remeasurements described above for the 26-week period ended December 31, 2022: U.S. Retirement Plan (In thousands) Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at July 2, 2022 $ 3,538,232   Service cost 4,357   Interest cost 80,604   Actuarial gain, net ( 440,311 ) Benefit payments ( 71,839 ) Settlements ( 694,998 ) Benefit obligation at December 31, 2022 2,416,045   Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at July 2, 2022 3,633,167   Actual return on plan assets ( 456,202 ) Benefit payments ( 71,839 ) Settlements ( 694,998 ) Fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2022 2,410,128   Funded status at December 31, 2022 $ ( 5,917 ) Components of Net Benefit Costs The components of net company-sponsored benefit cost for the U.S. Retirement Plan for the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 are as follows:   13-Week Period Ended 26-Week Period Ended   Dec. 31, 2022 Jan. 1, 2022 Dec. 31, 2022 Jan. 1, 2022 (In thousands) (In thousands) Service cost $ 2,034   $ 3,382   $ 4,357   $ 6,764   Interest cost 38,103   34,792   80,604   69,584   Expected return on plan assets ( 36,957 ) ( 51,580 ) ( 76,977 ) ( 103,160 ) Amortization of prior service cost 98   99   197   198   Amortization of actuarial loss 7,661   7,304   16,609   14,608   Settlement loss recognized 315,354   —   315,354   —   Net pension (benefits) costs $ 326,293   $ ( 6,003 ) $ 340,144   $ ( 12,006 ) The components of net company-sponsored benefit costs other than the service cost component are reported in Other expense (income), net within the consolidated results of operations. Assumptions The remeasurement of the benefit obligations and plan assets of the U.S. Retirement Plan that took place on October 31, 2022 reflects an updated discount rate and an updated expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations as of the remeasurement date was
6.07 %, as compared to the discount rate of
4.91 % that was used to determine benefit obligations as of July 2, 2022. The expected rate of return used to determine net company-sponsored benefit costs for the remainder of fiscal 2023 was updated to
6.00 % as of the remeasurement date, as compared to the expected rate of return of
4.50 % that was calculated as of July 2, 2022 to determine net company-sponsored benefit costs for fiscal 2023. 18 10.   EARNINGS PER SHARE The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:   13-Week Period Ended 26-Week Period Ended   Dec. 31, 2022 Jan. 1, 2022 Dec. 31, 2022 Jan. 1, 2022   (In thousands, except for share and per share data) (In thousands, except for share and per share data) Numerator:     Net earnings $ 141,216   $ 167,441   $ 606,784   $ 545,454   Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 507,609,696   511,044,400   507,594,137   511,780,234   Dilutive effect of share-based awards 2,536,098   3,530,489   2,670,336   3,398,676   Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 510,145,794   514,574,889   510,264,473   515,178,910   Basic earnings per share $ 0.28   $ 0.33   $ 1.20   $ 1.07   Diluted earnings per share $ 0.28   $ 0.33   $ 1.19   $ 1.06   The number of securities that were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because the effect would have been anti-dilutive was approximatel y

Comprehensive income was $ 527.8
million and $ 149.1
million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Comprehensive income was $ 764.1

12.   SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Sysco provides compensation benefits to employees under several share-based payment arrangements, including various long-term employee stock incentive plans and the 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). Stock Incentive Plans In the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, options to purchase
916,673
shares were granted to employees. The fair value of each option award is estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted average grant-date fair value per option granted during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 was $ 24.58 . 24 In the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, employees were granted
438,644
performance share units (PSUs). Based on the jurisdiction in which the employee resides, some of these PSUs were granted with forfeitable dividend equivalents. The fair value of each PSU award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant. For PSUs granted without dividend equivalents, the fair value was reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period. The weighted average grant-date fair value per PSU granted during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 was $ 85.31 . The PSUs will convert into shares of Sysco common stock at the end of the
three-year
performance period based on actual performance targets achieved, as well as the market-based return of Sysco’s common stock relative to that of each company within the S&P 500 index. In the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, employees were granted
244,068
restricted stock units. The weighted average grant-date fair value per restricted stock unit granted during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 was $ 84.12 . Employee Stock Purchase Plan Plan participants purchased
538,505
shares of common stock under the ESPP during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023. The weighted average fair value per employee stock purchase right issued pursuant to the ESPP was $ 10.95
during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023. The fair value of each stock purchase right is estimated as the difference between the stock price at the date of issuance and the employee purchase price. All Share-Based Payment Arrangements The total share-based compensation cost that has been recognized in results of operations was $ 52.7
million and $ 60.3
million for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, there was $ 136.3
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation arrangements. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
2.01
years. 13.   INCOME TAXES Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rates for the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 were
20.88 % and
21.54 %, respectively.
The second quarter was favorably impacted by the benefit of the pension buyout of $ 4.9  million and excess benefits of equity-based compensation, which totaled $ 1.4  million. The first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 were favorably impacted by excess tax benefits of equity-based compensation, which totaled $ 10.3  million.
The effective tax rates for the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022 were
21.27 % and
24.18 %, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022 was impacted by the increase in our reserve for uncertain tax positions of $ 12.0  million in the first quarter, partially offset by (1) the favorable impact of excess tax benefits of equity-based compensation that totaled $ 1.4  million and $ 2.9  million, respectively, and (2) the impact of corporate-owned life insurance policies that totaled an unfavorable $ 1.0  million in the second quarter and a favorable $ 1.0  million in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022. Uncertain Tax Positions As of December 31, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefit and related accrued interest was $ 32.4
million and $ 7.0
million, respectively. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit with respect to certain of the company’s unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease in the next 12 months. At this time, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change cannot be made. Other The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Inflation Reduction Act) was enacted on August 16, 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act imposes a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on “applicable corporations” for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The CAMT is imposed to the extent the alternative minimum tax exceeds a corporation’s regular tax liability. A corporation that pays alternative minimum tax is eligible for a credit against income tax in future years. Subject to future regulatory guidance, the company does not currently believe the CAMT will have a material impact on its 2023 tax liability. 25 The determination of the company’s provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. The company’s provision for income taxes reflects income earned and taxed in the various United States (U.S.) federal and state, as well as foreign jurisdictions. Tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent book versus tax basis differences, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances, and the company’s change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate. 14.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Legal Proceedings Sysco is engaged in various legal proceedings that have arisen but have not been fully adjudicated. The likelihood of loss for these legal proceedings, based on definitions within contingency accounting literature, ranges from remote to reasonably possible to probable. When probable and reasonably estimable, the losses have been accrued. Although the final results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, based on estimates of the range of potential losses associated with these matters, management does not believe the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company. 15.   BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION Sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. Our primary operations are located in North America and Europe. Under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise, we have aggregated certain operating segments into
three
reportable segments. “Other” financial information is attributable to our other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds. • U.S. Foodservice Operations
– primarily includes (a) our U.S. Broadline operations, which distribute a full line of food products, including custom-cut meat, seafood, produce, specialty Italian, specialty imports and a wide variety of non-food products and (b) our U.S. Specialty operations, which include our FreshPoint fresh produce distribution business, our Specialty Meats and Seafood Group specialty protein operations, our growing Italian Specialty platform anchored by Greco & Sons, our Asian specialty distribution company and a number of other small specialty businesses that are not material to our operations;
• International Foodservice Operations
– includes operations outside of the U.S., which distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products. The Americas primarily consists of operations in Canada, Bahamas, Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama, as well as our export operations that distribute to international customers. Our European operations primarily consist of operations in the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, Ireland and Sweden; • SYGMA
– our U.S. customized distribution operations serving quick-service chain restaurant customer locations; and • Other
– primarily our hotel supply operations, Guest Worldwide. The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by Sysco for its consolidated financial statements. Our Global Support Center generally includes all expenses of the corporate office and Sysco’s shared service operations. These also include all U.S. share-based compensation costs.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as of July 2, 2022, and for the fiscal year then ended, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, both contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2022 (our fiscal 2022 Form 10-K), as well as the consolidated financial statements (unaudited) and notes to the consolidated financial statements (unaudited) contained in this report.
Highlights Our second quarter of fiscal 2023 results were primarily attributable to sales growth that surpassed second quarter of fiscal 2022 levels by 13.9%. This double-digit sales growth resulted in operating income growth compared to the same period last year, driven by higher volumes, effective management of inflation and market share gains. Our gross profit growth this quarter outpaced operating expense, as we continued to make progress in improving our supply chain productivity. We continued to advance our Recipe For Growth strategy, with advancement in our digital tools, supply chain investments, and sales and merchandising initiatives, both domestically and internationally. Our second quarter net earnings also includes a pension liability transfer, which resulted in a non-cash charge of $315.4 million recorded within Other expense (income), net. See below for a comparison of our fiscal 2023 results to our fiscal 2022 results, both including and excluding Certain Items (as defined below).
Comparisons of results from the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to the second quarter of fiscal 2022 are presented below: • Sales: ◦ increased 13.9%, or $2.3 billion, to $18.6 billion; • Operating income: ◦ increased 44.0%, or $195.7 million, to $640.6 million; ◦ adjusted operating income increased 37.6%, or $186.4 million, to $682.1 million; • Net earnings: 27 ◦ decreased 15.7%, or $26.2 million, to $141.2 million; ◦ adjusted net earnings increased 39.7%, or $116.0 million, to $407.9 million; • Basic earnings per share: ◦ decreased 15.2%, or $0.05, to $0.28 per share; • Diluted earnings per share: ◦ decreased 15.2%, or $0.05, to $0.28 per share; ◦ adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 40.4%, or $0.23, to $0.80 in fiscal 2023; • EBITDA: ◦ decreased 22.6%, or $146.3 million, to $500.5 million; and ◦ adjusted EBITDA increased 23.9%, or $160.6 million, to $831.3 million. Comparisons of results from the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 to the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022 are presented below: • Sales: ◦ increased 15.1%, or $4.9 billion, to $37.7 billion; • Operating income: ◦ increased 27.7%, or $298.4 million, to $1.4 billion; ◦ adjusted operating income increased 23.0%, or $271.6 million, to $1.5 billion; • Net earnings: ◦ increased 11.2%, or $61.3 million, to $606.8 million; ◦ adjusted net earnings increased 24.8%, or $178.7 million, to $900.5 million; • Basic earnings per share: ◦ increased 12.1%, or $0.13, to $1.20 per share; • Diluted earnings per share: ◦ increased 12.3%, or $0.13, to $1.19 per share; and ◦ adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 25.7%, or $0.36, to $1.76 in fiscal 2023; • EBITDA: ◦ decreased 4.1%, or $59.8 million, to $1.4 billion; and ◦ adjusted EBITDA increased 14.7%, or $224.7 million, to $1.7 billion. The discussion of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, as we believe these metrics provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Other than free cash flow, any non-GAAP financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures to remove the impact of restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of: (1) restructuring charges, (2) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives and (3) facility closure and severance charges; acquisition-related costs consisting of: (a) intangible amortization expense and (b) acquisition costs and due diligence costs related to our acquisitions; and the reduction of bad debt expense previously recognized in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the collectability of our pre-pandemic trade receivable balances. Our results for fiscal 2023 were also impacted by adjustments to a product return allowance pertaining to COVID-related personal protection equipment inventory and a pension settlement charge that resulted from the purchase of a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract that transferred defined benefit plan obligations to an insurer. Our results for fiscal 2022 were also impacted by debt extinguishment costs and an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions. The fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 items discussed above are collectively referred to as “Certain Items.” The results of our foreign operations can be impacted by changes in exchange rates applicable to converting from local currencies to U.S. dollars. We measure our total Sysco and our International Foodservice Operations results on a constant currency basis.
Trends Economic and Industry Trends
The food-away-from-home sector experienced growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Restaurants continued to be resilient; however, industry sources had projected higher industry growth and such growth has been lower than projected. Even with slower growth, the food-away-from-home sector is positioned well to manage through a softer macro-economic environment and to experience future growth. We experienced a strong start to the year in national sales, which has driven market share gains overall, as we grew 1.35 times the market during the first half of the year.
28 Sales and Gross Profit Trends Our sales and gross profit performance are influenced by multiple factors, including price, volume, inflation, customer mix and product mix. The most significant factor affecting performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was volume growth, as we experienced a 5.2% improvement in total case volume and a 3.2% improvement in local case volume within our U.S. Foodservice segment, in each instance as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. This volume reflects our broadline and specialty businesses except for our specialty meats business which measures its volume in pounds. This growth enabled us to gain market share during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and we expect to continue seeing momentum on our rate of sales growth for the full year. Product cost inflation has also been a driver of our sales and gross profit performance. We experienced inflation at a rate of 8.3% and 9.0% in the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, respectively, at the total enterprise level, primarily driven by inflation in the dairy, fresh produce and frozen food categories. We continue to be successful in managing our inflation, resulting in an increase in gross profit dollars. Gross margin increased 29 and 24 basis points in the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, respectively, as compared to the same prior year periods, primarily driven by higher volumes, the effective management of inflation and progress with our partnership growth management initiatives. Operating Expense Trends Total operating expenses increased 10.7% and 14.1% during the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, respectively, as compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, driven by increased volumes, cost inflation, continued operational cost pressures from the operating environment and our planned investments to drive our transformation initiatives under our Recipe For Growth strategy. This quarter included: transformation investments of $55 million; new-colleague related productivity costs of $22 million; and expenditures related to the labor dispute we resolved in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. We continued to invest in associate retention and best-in-class training, primarily for transportation and warehouse colleagues. Our Sysco Driver Academy is contributing to improved retention and productivity, and we expect to see this trend improve as the percentage of drivers trained from within Sysco continues to grow. We believe the advancements we are making in our physical capabilities, and the investments we are making in improved training, will provide improved service levels to our customers and strengthen Sysco’s ability to profitably win market share. Pension Settlement Charge The Sysco Corporation Retirement Plan (the Plan) executed a commitment agreement to purchase a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract that transferred $695.0 million of the Plan’s defined benefit pension obligations related to certain pension benefits. As a result of the transaction, we recognized a one-time, non-cash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $315.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. This charge has been treated as a Certain Item. The amount of on-going expense for the Plan has been remeasured for the remainder of the fiscal year. Pension expense is elevated over fiscal 2022 due to increased interest rates and lower asset returns; the majority of the increase is included within Other expense, income net in the consolidated results of operations. We expect pension expense within this line item to increase by approximately $35 million for the last 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, as compared to the same time period in fiscal 2022. Mergers and Acquisitions We continue to focus on mergers and acquisitions as a part of our growth strategy, where we plan to reinforce our existing businesses while cultivating new channels, new segments and new capabilities. In the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, we acquired a total of three small U.S.-based independent Italian food distributors as part of our plan to meaningfully scale our growing Italian platform. The results of these acquisitions were not material to the consolidated results of the company for the
second quarter of fiscal 2023. Strategy Our purpose is “Connecting the World to Share Food and Care for One Another.” Purpose driven companies are believed to perform better, and we believe our purpose will assist us to grow substantially faster than the foodservice distribution industry and deliver profitable growth through our “Recipe for Growth” transformation. This growth transformation is supported by strategic pillars that we believe will allow us to better serve our customers, including our digital, products and solutions, supply chain, customer teams, and future horizons strategies. Our various business transformation initiatives remain on track, including promoting our specialty programs for produce, protein and Italian products and our customer growth initiatives. Our strategic initiative to enable omni-channel
29 inventory fulfillment is operating in our first test region, and we have made progress in expanding to deliveries six days a week. From these actions as a part of our Recipe for Growth, the benefits of our developing capabilities are apparent in the new customers we are winning and in the progress we are making towards increasing market share. We expect that, as our Recipe for Growth matures, the impact on our top-line growth will continue to accelerate. We are committed to profitably growing 1.5 times the market by the end of fiscal 2024, the third year of our three-year strategic plan. Results

This volume increase resulted in a 4.4% and 5.1% increase in the dollar value of sales compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, respectively. (2) Case volume reflects our broadline and specialty businesses, with the exception of our specialty meats business, which measures its volume in pounds. Any impact in volumes from these specialty meats operations is included within “Other.” The primary drivers of the sales increase in the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 were inflation, along with an improvement in case volume in our U.S. Foodservice Operations, which was largely the result of the impact of our Recipe for Growth initiatives. Case volumes from our U.S. Foodservice Operations increased 5.2% and 6.3% in the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, respectively, as compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022. This included a 3.2% increase in local customer case volume in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. 33 Operating Income The increase in operating income for the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, as compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, was driven by gross profit dollar growth and partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Gross profit dollar growth in the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, as compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, was driven primarily by the improvement in local cases stemming from: (1) the impact of our Recipe for Growth initiatives, (2) management of higher inflation and (3) partnership growth management initiatives. The estimated change in product costs, an internal measure of inflation or deflation, increased in both the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023. For the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, this change in product costs was primarily driven by inflation in the dairy, fresh produce and frozen foods categories. Gross margin, which is gross profit as a percentage of sales, was 19.1% in each of the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 for our U.S. Foodservice Operations, which was an increase of 45 basis points compared to gross margin of 18.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, and an increase of 42 basis points compared to gross margin of 18.7% in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022. The increase in operating expenses for the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, as compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, was primarily driven by increased volumes, cost inflation, operational pressures from the operating environment and our planned investments to drive our transformation initiatives.

Sales for the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 were higher, as compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, primarily due to inflation along with an improvement in volume, some of which was attributable to our Recipe for Growth initiatives. Partially offsetting these increases was the negative impact of foreign currency translation.
Operating Income The increase in operating income for the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, as compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, was due to the continuing increase in sales volumes, along with specific efforts to optimize our gross profit while addressing our increased operating expenses. The increase in gross profit dollars in the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, as compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, was attributable to the increase in sales volume and the management of inflation, along with specific efforts to optimize our gross profit dollars. The increase in operating expenses for the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, as compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, was primarily due to increased volume. Results of SYGMA and Other Segment For SYGMA, sales were 9.2% and 11.3% higher in the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, respectively, as compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, primarily from an increase in case volumes driven by the success of national and regional quick service restaurants and inflation. Operating income increased by $13.5 million and $21.5 million in the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, respectively, as compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, primarily due to the increase in case volumes and fee increases to customers. For the operations that are grouped within Other, operating income increased $9.7 million and $14.8 million in the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, respectively, as compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, primarily due to the recovery of our hospitality business, Guest Worldwide. Volume for this business has improved as hospitality occupancy rates have grown from prior year levels. Global Support Center Expenses Our Global Support Center generally includes all expenses of the corporate office and Sysco’s shared service operations. These expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased $11.6 million, or 5.0%, as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to lower employee-related costs.
These expenses in the first
26
weeks of fiscal
2023
increased $47.9 million, or 10.9%, as compared to the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, primarily due to increases in self-insurance reserves, fuel hedging program expenses and expenses associated with business technology transformation initiatives.
Included in Global Support Center expenses are Certain Items that totaled $10.2 million and $16.3 million in the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, as compared to $14.0 million and $41.7 million in the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, respectively. Certain Items impacting the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 were
36 primarily expenses associated with our business technology transformation initiatives. Certain Items impacting the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022 were primarily expenses associated with our business technology transformation initiatives and expenses associated with acquisitions.
Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $110.9 million and $114.9 million for the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, respectively, as compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, primarily from a $115.6 million charge taken for debt extinguished in fiscal 2022.
Other income and expense
Other expense increased $340.8 million and $359.3 million for the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, respectively, as compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022. The expense in the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 was primarily attributable to a pension settlement charge that resulted from the purchase of a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract that transferred defined benefit plan obligations to an insurer, as well as higher on-going pension expense.
Net Earnings Net earnings decreased 15.7% and increased 11.2% in the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, respectively, as compared to the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, due primarily to the items noted above for other expense, as well as items impacting our income taxes that are discussed in Note 13, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q. Adjusted net earnings, excluding Certain Items, increased 39.7% and 24.8% in the second quarter and first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, primarily due to an increase in sales volume.
Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 were $0.28, a 15.2% decrease from the comparable prior year amount of $0.33 per share. Diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 were $0.28, a 15.2% decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of $0.33 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding Certain Items, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 were $0.80, a 40.4% increase from the comparable prior year amount of $0.57 per share. Basic earnings per share in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 were $1.20, a 12.1% increase from the comparable prior year amount of $1.07 per share. Diluted earnings per share in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 were $1.19, a 12.3% increase from the comparable prior year period amount of $1.06 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding Certain Items, in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 were $1.76, a 25.7% increase from the comparable prior year amount of $1.40 per share. 37 Non-GAAP Reconciliations Our discussion of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Other than free cash flow and EBITDA, any non-GAAP financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures to remove the impact of: (1) restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of: (a) restructuring charges, (b) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives and (c) facility closure and severance charges; (2) acquisition-related costs consisting of: (a) intangible amortization expense and (b) acquisition costs and due diligence costs related to our acquisitions; and (3) the reduction of bad debt expense previously recognized in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the collectability of our pre-pandemic trade receivable balances. Our results for fiscal 2023 were also impacted by adjustments to a product return allowance related to COVID-related personal protection equipment inventory and a pension settlement charge that resulted from the purchase of a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract that transferred defined benefit plan obligations to an insurer. Our results for fiscal 2022 were also impacted by debt extinguishment costs and an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions. The results of our foreign operations can be impacted due to changes in exchange rates applicable in converting local currencies to U.S. dollars. We measure our total Sysco and our International Foodservice Operations results on a constant currency basis. Constant currency operating results are calculated by translating current-period local currency operating results with the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. Management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these Certain Items and presenting its International Foodservice Operations results on a constant currency basis, provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations and (2) facilitates comparisons on a year-over-year basis. Sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions and excludes from its non-GAAP financial measures the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, acquisition costs and due-diligence costs for those acquisitions. We believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of Sysco’s results for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Set forth below is a reconciliation of sales, operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to adjusted results for these measures for the periods presented. Individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add up to the total presented due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding. 38 13-Week Period Ended Dec. 31, 2022 13-Week Period Ended Jan. 1, 2022 Change in Dollars % Change Sales (GAAP) $ 18,593,953  $ 16,320,203  $ 2,273,750  13.9  % Impact of currency fluctuations

As of December 31, 2022, we had $500.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. We produced positive free cash flow in a period of higher working capital investments, capital expenditures and investments towards our Recipe for Growth strategy. In the table that follows, free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities and comparisons of the significant cash flows from the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 to the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022 are provided. On September 2, 2022, we upsized our commercial paper program to $3.0 billion. The commercial paper program allows the company to issue short-term, senior unsecured notes.
The notes are
pari passu
with the company’s other senior unsecured debt, including its senior notes and revolving credit facility. We intend to use any proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes. 50   26-Week Period Ended Dec. 31, 2022 26-Week Period Ended Jan. 1, 2022 Source of cash (use of cash) (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 503,466  $ 377,047  Additions to plant and equipment (309,664) (181,374) Proceeds from sales of plant and equipment 25,493  5,450  Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP)

See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Key Performance Indicators” contained in our fiscal 2022 Form 10-K for discussions regarding this non-GAAP performance metric. Sources and Uses of Cash Sysco generates cash in the U.S and internationally. As of December 31, 2022, we had $500.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately 98% of which was held by our international subsidiaries. Sysco’s strategic objectives are funded primarily by cash from operations and external borrowings. Traditionally, our operations have produced significant cash flow and, due to our strong financial position, we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access capital markets, as needed. Cash is generally allocated to working capital requirements, investments compatible with our overall growth strategy (organic and inorganic), debt management, and shareholder return. Remaining cash balances are invested in high-quality, short-term instruments.
We believe our cash flow from operations, the availability of liquidity under our commercial paper program and our revolving credit facility, and our ability to access capital from financial markets will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for more than the next 12 months, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes.
Cash Flows Operating Activities We generated $503.5 million in cash flows from operations in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, compared to cash flows from operations of $377.0 million in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022. In the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, these amounts included year-over-year unfavorable comparisons on working capital of $40.1 million due to a decrease in accounts payable, offset by a favorable comparison on accounts receivables and inventory. Accrued expenses also had negative comparisons, primarily from accrued incentives and accrued payroll in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 in comparison to the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022. Income taxes positively impacted cash flows from operations, as estimated payments made in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 were lower than in fiscal 2022 due to overpayments in the prior year. Investing Activities Our capital expenditures in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 consisted primarily of investments in buildings and building improvements, technology equipment, warehouse equipment, and fleet. Our capital expenditures in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 were $128.3 million higher than in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022, as we made investments to advance our Recipe for Growth strategy.
During the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, we paid $37.7 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions compared to $769.7 million in acquisitions made in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022. 51 Financing Activities Equity Transactions Proceeds from exercises of share-based compensation awards were $47.3 million in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023, as compared to $36.1 million in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022. The level of option exercises, and thus proceeds, will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price and the time remaining before option grants expire. In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of the company’s common stock, which will remain available until fully utilized. We commenced our share repurchase program during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We repurchased 3.1 million shares for $267.7 million during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we had a remaining authorization of approximately $4.2 billion.
Dividends paid in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2023 were $498.3 million, or $0.98 per share, as compared to $481.4 million, or $0.94 per share, in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2022. In November 2022, we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 of $0.49 per share, which was paid in January 2023.
Debt Activity and Borrowing Availability Our debt activity, including issuances and repayments, if any, and our borrowing availability are described in Note 8, “Debt,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q. Our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2022 are disclosed within that note. Guarantor Summarized Financial Information On January 19, 2011, the wholly owned U.S. Broadline subsidiaries of Sysco Corporation, which distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products, at that time entered into full and unconditional guarantees of all outstanding senior notes and debentures of Sysco Corporation. All subsequent issuances of senior notes and debentures in the U.S. and borrowings under the company’s now $3.0 billion long-term revolving credit facility have also been guaranteed by these subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, Sysco had a total of $10.0 billion in senior notes, debentures and borrowings under the long-term revolving credit facility that were guaranteed by these subsidiary guarantors. Our remaining consolidated subsidiaries (non-guarantor subsidiaries) are not obligated under the senior notes indenture, debentures indenture or our long-term revolving credit facility. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” contained in our fiscal 2022 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the terms of the guarantees. Basis of Preparation of the Summarized Financial Information
The summarized financial information of Sysco Corporation (issuer), and certain wholly owned U.S. Broadline subsidiaries (guarantors) (together, the obligor group) is presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances and transactions between entities in the obligor group eliminated. Investments in and equity in the earnings of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, which are not members of the obligor group, have been excluded from the summarized financial information. The obligor group’s amounts due to, amounts due from and transactions with non-guarantor subsidiaries have been presented in separate line items, if they are material to the obligor financials.
The following tables include summarized financial information of the obligor group for the periods presented. 52 Combined Parent and Guarantor Subsidiaries Summarized Balance Sheet Dec. 31, 2022 Jul. 2, 2022 (In thousands) ASSETS Receivables due from non-obligor subsidiaries $ 161,094  $ 264,378  Current assets 5,263,848  5,658,972  Total current assets $ 5,424,942  $ 5,923,350  Notes receivable from non-obligor subsidiaries

These policies require our most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, company-sponsored pension plans, allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory valuation, which are described in Item 7 of our fiscal 2022 Form 10-K and updated below. Company-Sponsored Pension Plans Amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. Two of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Our U.S. Retirement Plan is largely frozen and is only open to a small number of employees. Our SERP is frozen and is not open to any employees. None of these plans have a significant sensitivity to changes in discount rates s pecific to our results of operations, but such changes could impact our balance sheet due to a change in our funded status. Due to the low level of active employees in our retirement plans, our assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation is n ot a critical assumption. 53 In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, The Sysco Corporation Retirement Plan (the Plan), executed a commitment agreement to purchase a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract that transferred $695.0 million of the Plan’s defined benefit pension obligations related to certain pension benefits. As a result of the transaction, we recognized a one-time, non-cash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $315.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As a result of this transaction occurring, the expected long-term rate of return used in the calculation of on-going company-sponsored benefit costs for the U.S. Retirement Plan for the remainder of fiscal 2023 was reassessed and updated to 6.00% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, as compared to the expected long-term rate of return of 4.50% that was determined for fiscal 2023 in our fiscal 2022 Form 10-K. This update is primarily due to increases in interest rates, given that 70% of the Plan’s assets are invested in fixed income. The expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds, historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. Pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of December 31, 2022 was a charge, net of tax, of $829.5 million, as compared to a charge, net of tax, of $1.0 billion as of July 2, 2022. The decrease in the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss is due to a portion of it being recognized in earnings as a result of the settlement that took place in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our market risks consist of interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, fuel price risk and investment risk. For a discussion on our exposure to market risk, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks” in our fiscal 2022 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes to our market risks since July 2, 2022. Item 4.
Controls and Procedures Sysco’s management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Sysco’s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, Sysco’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 58 PART II – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
Legal Proceedings Environmental Matters
Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters in which a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and when such proceedings involve the potential for monetary sanctions that Sysco’s management reasonably believes will exceed a specified threshold. Pursuant to recent SEC amendments to this item, Sysco has chosen a reporting threshold for such proceedings of $1 million. Applying this threshold, there are no material environmental matters to disclose for this period. From time to time, we may be party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe there are any pending legal proceedings that, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Item 1A.
Risk Factors Except as provided below, there were no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of our fiscal 2022 Form 10-K. Unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, as well as unfavorable conditions in particular local markets, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations are susceptible to regional, national and international economic trends and uncertainties. Economic conditions can affect us in the following ways: • Unfavorable conditions can depress sales and/or gross margins in a given market. • Food cost and fuel cost inflation can lead to reductions in the frequency of dining out and the amount spent by consumers for food-away-from-home purchases, reducing demand for our products. • Heightened uncertainty in the financial markets negatively affects consumer confidence and discretionary spending. • The inability to consistently access credit markets could impair our ability to market and distribute food products, support our operations and meet our customers’ needs. • Liquidity and the inability of our customers and suppliers to consistently access credit markets to obtain cash to support their operations can cause temporary interruptions in our ability to collect funds from our customers and obtain the products and supplies that we need in the quantities and at the prices that we request. • Foreign exchange rate fluctuations can adversely impact our competitiveness and/or financial results. The countries in which we operate, have experienced, and are experiencing, from time to time, deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in financial markets, which have adversely impacted business and consumer confidence and spending and depressed capital investment and economic activity in the affected regions. Such conditions and high levels of uncertainty make it difficult to predict when, or if, a recession may occur. In fact, some commentators have suggested that the U.S. is already in a recession.
A prolonged economic downturn or recession in the U.S. or global economies, and the impact on gross domestic product growth, corporate earnings, consumer confidence, employment rates, income levels and/or personal wealth, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
