PURE
Bioscience, Inc.
Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
For
the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022
1.
Basis of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of PURE Bioscience, Inc. and its
wholly owned subsidiary, ETI H2O Inc., a Nevada corporation. ETI H2O, Inc. currently has no business operations and no material assets
or liabilities and there have been no significant transactions related to ETI H2O, Inc. during the periods presented in the condensed
consolidated financial statements. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. All references to “PURE,”
“we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company” refer to PURE Bioscience, Inc. and our wholly owned
subsidiary.
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, for interim financial information pursuant to the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article
10/Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete
financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary
for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the quarter ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of
the results that may be expected for other quarters or the year ending July 31, 2023. The July 31, 2022 balance sheet was derived from
audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP and included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. For
more complete information, these unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2022 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K covering such period filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on October 28, 2022.
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
2.
Liquidity and Going Concern
We
have a history of recurring losses, and as of January 31, 2023 we have incurred a cumulative net loss of $ 131,300,000 . During the six
months ended January 31, 2023, we recorded a net loss of $ 2,053,000
on recorded net revenue of $ 868,000 . In addition, during the six
months ended January 31, 2023 we used $ 1,906,000
in operating and investing activities resulting in a cash balance of $ 1,485,000
as of
January 31, 2023. Our history of recurring operating losses, and negative cash flows from operating activities give rise to substantial
doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its
report on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2022, has also expressed substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that
may result from our possible inability to continue as a going concern.
Our
future capital requirements depend on numerous forward-looking factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:
the acceptance of, and demand for, our products; our success and the success of our partners in selling our products; our success and
the success of our partners in obtaining regulatory approvals to sell our products; the costs of further developing our existing products
and technologies; the extent to which we invest in new product and technology development; and the costs associated with the continued
operation, and any future growth, of our business. The outcome of these and other forward-looking factors will substantially affect our
liquidity and capital resources.
Until
we can continually generate positive cash flow from operations, we will need to continue to fund our operations with the proceeds of
offerings of our equity and debt securities. However, we cannot ensure that additional financing will be available when needed or that,
if available, financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds from the issuance
of equity securities, substantial dilution to our existing stockholders would likely result. If we raise additional funds by incurring
debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios
that may restrict our ability to operate our business.

Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue
Recognition
We
account for revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”),
Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”). Under Topic 606, revenue is recognized at an amount that
reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. This principle
is applied using the following 5-step process:
1.
Identify the contract with the customer
2.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3.
Determine the transaction price
4.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract
5.
Recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation
is satisfied
Under
Topic 606, we recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods or services to
our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
Our
technology platform is based on patented stabilized ionic silver, and our initial products contain silver dihydrogen citrate, or SDC.
SDC is a broad-spectrum, non-toxic antimicrobial agent, which offers 24-hour residual protection and formulates well with other compounds.
We sell various configurations and dilutions of SDC direct to customers and through distributors. We currently offer PURE ®
Hard Surface as a food contact surface sanitizer and disinfectant to restaurant chains, food processors and food transportation companies.
We also offer PURE Control ®
as a direct food contact processing aid.
Contract
terms for unit price, quantity, shipping and payment are governed by sales agreements and purchase orders which we consider to be a customer’s
contract in all cases. The unit price is considered the observable stand-alone selling price for the arrangements. Any promotional or
sales discounts are applied evenly to the units sold for purposes of calculating standalone selling price.
Product
sales generally consist of a single performance obligation that we satisfy at a point in time. We recognize product revenue when the
following events have occurred: (a) we have transferred physical possession of the products, (b) we have a present right to payment,
(c) the customer has legal title to the products, and (d) the customer bears significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products.
Our
direct customer and distributor sales are invoiced based on received purchase orders. Our payment terms on invoiced direct customer and
distributor sales range between 30 and 90 days after we satisfy our performance obligation. The majority of our customers are on 30 day
payment terms. We currently offer no right of return on invoiced sales and maintain no allowance for sales returns.
Shipping
and handling are treated as activities to fulfill promises to customers and any amounts billed to a customer, if applicable, represent
revenues earned for the goods provided. Costs related to such shipping and handling billings are classified as cost of sales.
We
do not have significant categories of revenue that may impact how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
are affected by economic factors.
A
summary of our revenue by product type for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:

Variable
Consideration
We
record revenue from customers in an amount that reflects the transaction price we expect to be entitled to after transferring control
of those goods or services. From time to time, we offer sales promotions on our products such as discounts. Variable consideration is
estimated at contract inception only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.
8
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements, and the disclosures made in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates. Those estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible accounts, inventory
obsolescence, depreciable lives of property and equipment, analysis of impairments of recorded long-term tangible and intangible assets,
realization of deferred tax assets, accruals for potential liabilities and assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services.
Net
Loss Per Share
Basic
net loss per common share is computed as net loss divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
Our diluted net loss per common share is the same as our basic net loss per common share because we incurred a net loss during each period
presented, and the potentially dilutive securities from the assumed exercise of all outstanding stock options, restricted stock units,
and warrants would have an anti-dilutive effect. As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, stock options and shares issuable under restricted
stock unit awards of
9,098,125
and
8,676,625 , respectively, have been excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding.

Cost is determined using the average cost method. Depreciation related to manufacturing is systematically allocated to inventory produced,
and expensed through cost of goods sold at the time inventory is sold.

Share-Based
Compensation
We
periodically issue stock options and restricted stock awards to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services
and for financing costs. We account for such grants issued and vesting to employees based on ASC 718, whereby the value of the award
is measured on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period.
We
estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes
option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including price volatility of the underlying stock, risk-free interest
rate, dividend yield, and expected life of the option. Share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest,
and therefore is reduced by expected forfeitures.
Concentrations
Gross
product sales . For the three months ended January 31, 2023, two individual customers accounted for
16 % and
15 % of our net product
sales. For the six months ended January 31, 2023, one customer accounted for
10 % of our net product sales, respectively. For the three
months ended January 31, 2022, two customers accounted for
14 % of net product sales, while two additional customers accounted for
13 %
and
10 % of net product sales, respectively. For the six months ended January 31, 2022, three customers accounted for
18 %,
13 % and
12 %
of our net product sales, respectively.
Accounts
receivable.
As of January 31, 2023, we had accounts receivable from two customers that comprised
31 % and
19 % of total accounts receivable.
As of January 31, 2022, we had accounts receivable from three customers that comprised of
26 %,
11 % and
10 % of total accounts receivable,
respectively.
Purchases.
For the three months ended January 31, 2023, one vendor accounted for
19 % of our purchases. For the six months ended January 31,
2023, one vendor accounted for
14 % of our purchases. For the three months ended January 31, 2022, one vendor accounted for
19 % of our
purchases. For the six months ended January 31, 2022, one vendor accounted for
18 % of our purchases.
Accounts
payable.
As of January 31, 2023, our largest three vendors accounted for
22 %,
10 % and
10 % of the total trade accounts payable, respectively.
As of January 31, 2022, our largest vendor accounted for
29 % of the total accounts payable.
Segments
We
operate in
one
segment for the manufacture and distribution of our products. In accordance with the “Segment Reporting” Topic
of the ASC, our chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews operating
results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which is based
on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report
annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers, and the countries in which the entity holds material assets
and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under “Segment Reporting” due to their similar
customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution
processes. Since the Company operates in one segment, all financial information required by “Segment Reporting” can be found
in the accompanying financial statements

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments or ASC 326. The standard
significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets, including accounts and notes receivable. The
standard will replace today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model, under which companies
will recognize allowances based on expected rather than incurred losses. Entities will apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect
adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. As small business
filer, the standard will be effective for us for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company
is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.
In
May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt — Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50),
Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic
815-40): Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options or ASU
2021-04. ASU 2021-04 provides guidance as to how an issuer should account for a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange
of a freestanding equity-classified written call option (i.e., a warrant) that remains classified after modification or exchange as an
exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument. An issuer should measure the effect of a modification or exchange as the difference
between the fair value of the modified or exchanged warrant and the fair value of that warrant immediately before modification or exchange
and then apply a recognition model that comprises four categories of transactions and the corresponding accounting treatment for each
category (equity issuance, debt origination, debt modification, and modifications unrelated to equity issuance and debt origination or
modification). ASU 2021-04 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods
within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2021-04 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement
presentation or disclosures.
Recent
accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s
present or future consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.
5.
Debt
Receipt
of CARES funding
In
April 2021, we were funded $ 239,000
under the Payroll Protection Program (“PPP”) through California Bank and Trust. The PPP
was established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and is administered by
the U.S. Small Business Administration.
The CARES Act was established in order to enable small businesses to pay employees during the
economic slowdown caused by COVID-19 by providing forgivable loans to qualifying businesses for up to 2.5 times their average monthly
payroll costs. The amount borrowed under the CARES Act is eligible to be forgiven provided that (a) the Company uses the PPP Funds during
the eight week period after receipt thereof, and (b) the PPP Funds are only used to cover payroll costs (including benefits), rent, mortgage
interest, and utility costs.
The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if, among other reasons, the Company does not maintain staffing
or payroll levels. Principal and interest payments on any unforgiven portion of the PPP Funds (the “PPP Loan”) will be deferred
for six months and will accrue interest at a fixed annual rate of
1.0 % and carry a
two year
maturity date. There is no prepayment penalty
on the CARES Act Loan.
During
the six months ended January 31, 2022, we applied and received loan forgiveness under the provisions of the CARES Act for the entire
$ 239,000
loan. This amount was recorded as a gain on extinguishment of indebtedness on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations
during the six months ended January 31, 2022.

6.
Stockholders’ Equity
Restricted
Stock Units
We
issue restricted stock unit awards or RSUs, to key management and as compensation for services to consultants and others. The RSUs typically
vest over a one to three-year period and carry a ten-year term. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of common stock, issuable
at the time the RSU subsequently settles, as set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. We determine that fair value of those
awards at the date of grant, and amortize those awards as an expense over the vesting period of the award. The shares earned under the
grant are usually issued when the award settles at the end of the term. As of July 31, 2022, there were
1,212,500
RSU’s outstanding
of which
1,045,833
were issuable.
During
the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $ 42,000
of compensation cost relating to the vesting of RSU’s, respectively.
As of January 31, 2023, there was $ 20,000
of unrecognized non-cash compensation cost related to the remaining
166,667
RSUs we expect
to vest, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of
0.24
years.
During
the six months ended January 31, 2023,
no
RSUs were granted, issued, or forfeited. Of the
1,212,500
RSUs outstanding as of January 31,
2023,
1,045,833
RSUs are vested and issuable.
These RSUs are issued upon settlement date which is defined as “for each Vested Unit,
the earliest of (i) the ten-year anniversary of the Grant Date; (ii) sixty days after the date the Grantee’s Service ceases for
any reason and such cessation constitutes a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code; (iii)
the date of Grantee’s death or (iv) the date of a Change in Control that constitutes a “change in control event” within
the meaning of Section 409A of the Code”.

Option Plans
2007
Equity Incentive Plan
In
February 2016, we amended and restated our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, the (“2007 Plan”), to, among other changes, increase
the number of shares of common stock issuable under the 2007 Plan by
4,000,000
shares and extend the term of the 2007 Plan until
February
4, 2026 . The 2007 Plan provides for the grant of incentive and non-qualified stock options, as well as other share-based payment awards,
to our employees, directors, consultants and advisors. These awards have up to a
10 -year contractual life and are subject to various
vesting periods, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. As of January 31, 2023, there were approximately
681,000
shares available for issuance under the 2007 Plan.
2017
Equity Incentive Plan
In
January 2021, we amended and restated our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, the (“2017 Plan”), to, among other changes, increase
the number of shares of common stock issuable under the 2017 Plan by
5,000,000
shares and extend the term of the 2007 Plan until January
2031. The 2017 Plan provides for the grant of incentive and non-qualified stock options, as well as other share-based payment awards,
to our employees, directors, consultants and advisors. These awards have up to a
10 -year contractual life and are subject to various
vesting periods, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. As of January 31, 2023, there were approximately
3,856,000
shares available for issuance under the 2017 Plan.
During
the six months ended January 31, 2023, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors granted
1,935,000
stock options to our employees,
officers, directors and consultants with a fair value of $ 241,000
as determined by the Black Scholes option pricing model.
The vesting
terms of the options vary between one and two years and carry a ten year term . There were no stock options granted during the three months
ended January 31, 2023.

6.9
years.
At
January 31, 2023, options to purchase
6,550,208
shares of common stock were exercisable. These options had a weighted-average exercise
price of $ 0.56
and a weighted average remaining contractual term of
6.33
years. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested
stock option grants as of January 31, 2023 was approximately $ 153,000
and the weighted average period over which these grants are expected
to vest is
0.78
years.
For
the six months ended January 31, 2023, share-based compensation expense for stock options that vested during the period was $ 169,000 .
For the six months ended January 31, 2022, share-based compensation expense for stock options that vested during the period was $ 328,000 .
We
use the Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock options. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over
the vesting period using the straight-line method. The fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using the following

Volatility
is the measure by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of an option. Volatility is derived from the
historical daily change in the market price of our common stock, as we believe that historical volatility is the best indicator of future
volatility.
The
risk-free interest rates used in the Black-Scholes calculations are based on the prevailing U.S. Treasury yield as determined by the
U.S. Federal Reserve.
We
have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Accordingly,
we have assumed no dividend yield for purposes of estimating the fair value of our share-based compensation.
The
expected life of options was estimated using the average between the contractual term and the vesting term of the options.

Commitments and Contingencies
COVID-19
The
COVID-19 pandemic led to severe disruptions in general economic activities, as businesses and federal, state, and local governments took
broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis. While we have experienced some delays related to final third-party validation of
certain of our products and product rollouts by customers using PURE Control, we did not experience a material disruption to our business.
In addition, we previously benefited from increased demand from our customers for our PURE Hard Surface product due to a focus on surface
disinfecting in response to attempting to prevent COVID-19 transmission. We subsequently experienced an abatement in such demand. Such
abatement has not stabilized and we cannot assure you that demand will stabilize in the future. Additionally, we experienced supply chain
issues with our various plastic packaging configurations and citric acid. Further, on a go-forward basis, we cannot guarantee the overall
economic conditions will not affect our business, as these conditions may significantly negatively impact all aspects of our business.
Our business is dependent on the continued health and productivity of our employees, including our sales staff and corporate management
team.
The
extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or other health-related pandemics impacts our business, sales, results of operations and financial
condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic or
other health-related pandemics has subsided, we may experience significant impacts to our business as a result of its global economic
impact, including any economic downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.

We have attempted to identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “can,”
“continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,”
“potential,” “predict,” “should,” “would” or “will” or the negative of these
terms or other comparable terminology, but their absence does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These statements are
only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause our actual results to differ
from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make. Several risks and uncertainties we face are discussed in more detail
under “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report or in the discussion and analysis below. You should, however,

identified by us to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties that could materially affect us. You should not place undue
reliance on the forward-looking statements we make herein because some or all of them may turn out to be wrong. We undertake no obligation
to update any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events and developments, except as required by law.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial
statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Overview
We
are focused on developing and commercializing proprietary antimicrobial products that provide safe and cost-effective solutions to the
health and environmental challenges of pathogen and hygienic control. Our technology platform is based on patented stabilized ionic silver,
and our initial products contain silver dihydrogen citrate, or SDC. SDC is a broad-spectrum, non-toxic antimicrobial agent, which offers
24-hour residual protection and formulates well with other compounds. As a platform technology, we believe SDC is distinguished from
existing products in the marketplace because of its superior efficacy, reduced toxicity, non-causticity and the inability of bacteria
to form a resistance to it.
We
believe there is a significant market opportunity for our safe, non-toxic, non-caustic and effective SDC-based solutions. We currently
offer PURE ®
Hard Surface as a food contact surface sanitizer and disinfectant to restaurant chains, food processors and
food transportation companies. We also offer PURE Control ®
as a direct food contact processing aid. In addition to our
direct sales efforts with PURE Hard Surface and PURE Control, we market and sell our SDC-based products indirectly through third-party
distributors supporting various industries.
15
Business
Strategy
Our
goal is to become a sustainable company by commercializing the SDC-based products we have developed with our proprietary technology platform.
We are focused on delivering leading antimicrobial products that address food safety risks across the food industry supply chain. Key
aspects of our business strategy include:
●
Expanding sales and distribution
for our products into the food industry with a focus on a dual track of food safety market opportunities:
●
Hard Surface Disinfectant
- commercializing our current EPA registered PURE Hard Surface disinfectant and sanitizer for use in foodservice operations,
food manufacturing and food transportation.
●
Direct Food Contact
- commercializing FDA approved PURE Control as a direct food contact processing aid for fresh produce; commercializing FDA
approved PURE Control as a food processing and intervention aid for food processors treating raw poultry in pre and post on-line
reprocessing.
●
Continuing to grow and
establish new strategic alliances to maximize the commercial potential of our technology platform;
●
Continuing to partner with
third parties who are seeking, or intend to seek, approvals to market SDC-based products in markets outside the U.S.
●
Developing additional proprietary
products and applications; and
●
Protecting and enhancing
our intellectual property.
In
addition to our current products addressing food safety, we intend to leverage our technology platform through licensing and distribution
collaborations in order to develop new products and enter into new markets that could potentially generate multiple sources of revenue.
Financial
Overview
This
financial overview provides a general description of our revenue and expenses.
Net
Product Sales
We
contract manufacture and sell SDC-based products for end use, and as a raw material for manufacturing use. We recognize revenue when
we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods or services to our customers, in an amount that reflects
the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Any amounts received prior to satisfying revenue
recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates –
Revenue Recognition ”.
Cost
of Goods Sold
Cost
of goods sold for product sales includes direct and indirect costs to manufacture products, including materials consumed, manufacturing
overhead, shipping costs, salaries, benefits, reserved inventory, and related expenses of operations. Depreciation related to manufacturing
is systematically allocated to inventory produced, and expensed through cost of goods sold at the time inventory is sold.
16
Selling,
General and Administrative
Selling,
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in business development, sales,
finance, accounting, information technology, and executive functions. Other selling, general and administrative costs include product
marketing, advertising, and trade show costs, as well as public relations and investor relations, facility costs, and legal, accounting
and other professional fees.
Research
and Development
Our
research and development activities are focused on leveraging our technology platform to develop additional proprietary products and
applications. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs, product registration expenses, and
third-party testing. We expense research and development costs as incurred.
Other
Income (Expense)
We
record interest income, interest expense, the change in derivative liabilities, as well as other non-operating transactions, as other
income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations.
COVID-19
The
COVID-19 pandemic led to severe disruptions in general economic activities, as businesses and federal, state, and local governments took
broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis. While we have experienced some delays related to final third-party validation of
certain of our products and product rollouts by customers using PURE Control, we did not experience a material disruption to our business.
In addition, we previously benefited from increased demand from our customers for our PURE Hard Surface product due to a focus on surface
disinfecting in response to attempting to prevent COVID-19 transmission. We subsequently experienced an abatement in such demand. Such
abatement has not stabilized and we cannot assure you that demand will stabilize in the future. Additionally, we experienced supply chain
issues with our various plastic packaging configurations and citric acid. Further, on a go-forward basis, we cannot guarantee the overall
economic conditions will not affect our business, as these conditions may significantly negatively impact all aspects of our business.
Our business is dependent on the continued health and productivity of our employees, including our sales staff and corporate management
team.
The
extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or other health-related pandemics impacts our business, sales, results of operations and financial
condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic or
other health-related pandemics has subsided, we may experience significant impacts to our business as a result of its global economic
impact, including any economic downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.
17
Results
of Operations
Fluctuations
in Operating Results
Our
results of operations have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future.
We anticipate that our results of operations will be affected for the foreseeable future by several factors that may contribute to these
periodic fluctuations, including fluctuations in the buying patterns of our current or potential customers for which we have no visibility,
the mix of product sales including a change in the percentage of higher or lower margin formulations and packaging configurations of
our products, the cost of product sales including component costs, our inability for any reason to be able to meet demand, the achievement
and timing of research and development and regulatory milestones, unforeseen changes in expenses, including non-cash expenses such as
the fair value of equity awards granted and the fair value change of derivative liabilities, the calculation of which includes several
variable assumptions, and unforeseen manufacturing or supply issues, among other issues. Due to these fluctuations, we believe that the
period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not a reliable indication of our future performance. As of the date of this
filing, we are not aware of any trends in these factors or events or conditions that we believe are reasonably likely to impact our results
of operations in the future.
Comparison
of the Three Months Ended January 31, 2023 and 2022
Net
Product Sales
Net
product sales were $396,000 and $415,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease of $19,000
was attributable to decreased sales across our distribution network. Our top two customers accounted for $122,000 of net product sales
for the three months ended January 31, 2023.
For
the three months ended January 31, 2023, two customers accounted for 16% and 15% of net product sales, respectively. No other individual
customer accounted for 10% or more of our net product sales. All of our net product sales were U.S. based sales.
For
the three months ended January 31, 2022, two customers accounted for 14% of net product sales, while two additional customers accounted
for 13% and 10% of net product sales, respectively. No other individual customer accounted for 10% or more of our net product sales.
All of our net product sales were U.S. based sales.
During
the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $1,000 in royalties from a nonexclusive third-party distributor, respectively.
Cost
of Goods Sold
Cost
of goods sold was $200,000 and $182,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The
increase of $18,000 was primarily attributable to increased contract manufacturing costs.
Gross
margin as a percentage of net product sales, or gross margin percentage, was 49% and 56% for the three months ended January 31, 2023
and 2022, respectively. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to increased contract manufacturing costs,
as well as, the sale of higher margin formulations and packaging configurations of our products during the quarter ended January 31,
2022, as compared with the current period.
Selling,
General and Administrative Expense
Selling,
general and administrative expense was $1,180,000 and $1,093,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The increase of $87,000 was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs. The increases were partially offset by decreased professional
service costs.
Share-based
compensation expense, included in selling, general and administrative expense, was $127,000 and $180,000 for the three months ended January
31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease of $53,000 is primarily due to the prior year vesting of stock options and restricted stock
units granted to employees, directors and consultants supporting our selling, general and administrative functions.
Research
and Development Expense
Research
and development expense, primarily consisting of third-party fees and personnel costs, was $75,000 and $81,000 for the three months ended
January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Other
Income (Expense)
In
April 2021, we were funded $239,000 under the Payroll Protection Program (“PPP”) through California Bank and Trust. The PPP
was established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and is administered by
the U.S. Small Business Administration. During the three months ended January 31, 2022, we received loan forgiveness under the provisions
of the CARES Act for the entire $239,000 loan. This amount was recorded as a gain on extinguishment of indebtedness on the Condensed
Consolidated Statement of Operations during the three months ended January 31, 2022.

Comparison
of the Six Months Ended January 31, 2023 and 2022
Net
Product Sales
Net
product sales were $863,000 and $912,000 for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease of $49,000 was
attributable to decreased sales across our distribution network. Our top two customers accounted for $170,000 of net product sales for
the six months ended January 31, 2023.
For
the six months ended January 31, 2023, one individual customer accounted for 10% of our net product sales. No other individual customer
accounted for 10% or more of our net product sales. All of our net product sales were U.S. based sales.
For
the six months ended January 31, 2022, three individual customers accounted for 18%, 13% and 11% of our net product sales, respectively.
No other individual customer accounted for 10% or more of our net product sales. All of our net product sales were U.S. based sales.
During
the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $5,000 in royalties from a nonexclusive third-party distributor, respectively.
Cost
of Goods Sold
Cost
of goods sold was $414,000 and $354,000 for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase of $60,000 was
primarily attributable to increased contract manufacturing costs.
Gross
margin as a percentage of net product sales, or gross margin percentage, was 52% and 61% for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and
2022, respectively. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to increased contract manufacturing costs, as
well as, the sale of higher margin formulations and packaging configurations of our products during the six months ended January 31,
2022, as compared with the current period.
Selling,
General and Administrative Expense
Selling,
general and administrative expense was $2,345,000 and $2,150,000 for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The
increase of $195,000 was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs and travel expense.
Share-based
compensation expense, included in selling, general and administrative expense, was $211,000 and $370,000 for the six months ended January
31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease of $159,000 is primarily due to the prior year vesting of stock options and restricted
stock units granted to employees, directors and consultants supporting our selling, general and administrative functions.
Research
and Development Expense
Research
and development expense, primarily consisting of third-party fees and personnel costs, was $153,000 and $148,000 for the six months ended
January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Other
Income (Expense)
In
April 2021, we were funded $239,000 under the Payroll Protection Program (“PPP”) through California Bank and Trust. The PPP
was established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and is administered by
the U.S. Small Business Administration. During the six months ended January 31, 2022, we received loan forgiveness under the provisions
of the CARES Act for the entire $239,000 loan. This amount was recorded as a gain on extinguishment of indebtedness on the Condensed
Consolidated Statement of Operations during the six months ended January 31, 2022.
19
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
As
of January 31, 2023, we had $1,560,000 in cash and cash equivalents compared with $3,466,000 in cash and cash equivalents as of July
31, 2022. The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to the use of cash to fund our operations and investments
in property, plant and equipment. Additionally, as of January 31, 2023, we had $463,000 of current liabilities, including $347,000 in
accounts payable, compared with $575,000 of current liabilities, including $488,000 in accounts payable as of July 31, 2022. The net
decrease in current liabilities was primarily due to trade payables due to our contract manufactures.
We
have a history of recurring losses, and as of January 31, 2023 we have incurred a cumulative net loss of $131,300,000. During the six
months ended January 31, 2023, we recorded a net loss of $2,053,000 on recorded net revenue of $868,000. In addition, during the six
months ended January 31, 2023 we used $1,906,000 in operating and investing activities resulting in a cash balance of $1,485,000 as of
January 31, 2023. Our history of recurring operating losses, and negative cash flows from operating activities give rise to substantial
doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible
future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from
our possible inability to continue as a going concern.
Our
future capital requirements depend on numerous forward-looking factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:
the acceptance of, and demand for, our products; our success and the success of our partners in selling our products; our success and
the success of our partners in obtaining regulatory approvals to sell our products; the costs of further developing our existing products
and technologies; the extent to which we invest in new product and technology development; and the costs associated with the continued
operation, and any future growth, of our business. The outcome of these and other forward-looking factors will substantially affect our
liquidity and capital resources.
Until
we can continually generate positive cash flow from operations, we will need to continue to fund our operations with the proceeds of
offerings of our equity and debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when needed or
that, if available, financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds from the
issuance of equity securities, substantial dilution to our existing stockholders would likely result. If we raise additional funds by
incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial
ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
In
addition, the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report have been prepared and presented on a basis
assuming we will continue as a going concern. Until we can generate significant cash from operations, we expect to continue to fund our
operations with the proceeds of offerings of our equity and debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that additional financing
will be available when needed or that, if available, financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders. If we
raise additional funds from the issuance of equity securities, substantial dilution to our existing stockholders would likely result.
If we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well
as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business. Further, any contracts or license arrangements
we enter into to raise funds may require us to relinquish our rights to our products or technology, and we cannot assure you that we
will be able to enter into any such contracts or license arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all. Having insufficient funds may require
us to delay or scale back our marketing, distribution and other commercialization activities or cease our operations altogether. Our
financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to recoverability or classification of recorded assets and classification
of recorded liabilities.
We
believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to aid you in understanding and evaluating our reported financial
results.
20
Revenue
Recognition
We
recognize revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”),
Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”). Under Topic 606, revenue is recognized at an amount that
reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. This principle
is applied using the following 5-step process:
1.
Identify the contract with the customer
2.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3.
Determine the transaction price
4.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract
5.
Recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation
is satisfied
Under
Topic 606, we recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods or services to
our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
Our
technology platform is based on patented stabilized ionic silver, and our initial products contain silver dihydrogen citrate, or SDC.
SDC is a broad-spectrum, non-toxic antimicrobial agent, which offers 24-hour residual protection and formulates well with other compounds.
We sell various configurations and dilutions of SDC direct to customers and through distributors. We currently offer PURE ®
Hard Surface as a food contact surface sanitizer and disinfectant to restaurant chains, food processors and food transportation companies.
We also offer PURE Control ®
as a direct food contact processing aid.
Contract
terms for unit price, quantity, shipping and payment are governed by sales agreements and purchase orders which we consider to be a customer’s
contract in all cases. The unit price is considered the observable stand-alone selling price for the arrangements. Any promotional or
sales discounts are applied evenly to the units sold for purposes of calculating standalone selling price.
Product
sales generally consist of a single performance obligation that we satisfy at a point in time. We recognize product revenue when the
following events have occurred: (a) we have transferred physical possession of the products, (b) we have a present right to payment,
(c) the customer has legal title to the products, and (d) the customer bears significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products.
Our
direct customer and distributor sales are invoiced based on received purchase orders. Our payment terms on invoiced direct customer and
distributor sales range between 30 and 90 days after we satisfy our performance obligation. The majority of our customers are on 30 day
payment terms. We currently offer no right of return on invoiced sales and maintain no allowance for sales returns.
Shipping
and handling are treated as activities to fulfill promises to customers and any amounts billed to a customer, if applicable, represent
revenues earned for the goods provided. Costs related to such shipping and handling billings are classified as cost of sales.
We
do not have significant categories of revenue that may impact how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
are affected by economic factors.
We
do not allow for returns, except for damaged products when the damage occurred pre-fulfillment. Damaged product returns have historically
been insignificant. Because of this, the stand-alone nature of our products, and our assessment of performance obligations and transaction
pricing for our sales contracts, we do not currently maintain a contract asset or liability balance for obligations. We assess our contracts
and the reasonableness of our conclusions on a quarterly basis.
The
Company’s licensing contracts typically provide for royalties based on the licensee’s sales of various configurations of
PURE Hard Surface. The Company records its royalty revenue in the month in which the licensee sold our products to end users. Payments
are generally received in the subsequent month.
Variable
Consideration
We
record revenue from customers in an amount that reflects the transaction price we expect to be entitled to after transferring control
of those goods or services. From time to time, we offer sales promotions on our products such as discounts. Variable consideration is
estimated at contract inception only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.
21
Share-Based
Compensation
We
grant equity-based awards under share-based compensation plans or stand-alone contracts. We estimate the fair value of share-based payment
awards using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This fair value is then amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including price volatility of the underlying stock,
risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, and expected life of the option. Share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately
expected to vest, and therefore is reduced by expected forfeitures. Changes in assumptions used under the Black-Scholes option valuation
model could materially affect our net loss and net loss per share.
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
In
accordance with GAAP, if indicators of impairment exist, we assess the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets by determining
whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows. If impairment is indicated,
we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the fair value of the asset and we record the
impairment as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results. Estimating the undiscounted future
cash flows associated with long-lived assets requires judgment, and assumptions could differ materially from actual results. During the
three and six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, no impairment of long-lived assets was indicated or recorded.

of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, or SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective.
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
In
connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d), our management, under the supervision and with the participation
of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, concluded that there were no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting during the six months ended January 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART
II – Other Information
Item
1. Legal Proceedings
From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. The
impact and outcome of litigation, if any, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and any adverse result in these or other matters may
arise from time to time that could harm our business. We are not currently aware of any such legal proceedings or claims to which we
or our wholly owned subsidiary is a party or of which any of our property is subject that we believe will have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Item
1A. Risk Factors
In
evaluating us and our common stock, we urge you to carefully consider the risks and other information in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q, including the risk factor included below, as well as the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. to Part I of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, which we filed with the SEC on October 28, 2022 (the “Form
10-K”), and Item 1.A. to our Current Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2022, which we filed with the SEC
on December 14, 2022. Other than the risk factor included below, the risks and uncertainties described in “Item 1A —
Risk Factors” of our Form 10-K have not materially changed and “Item 1.A.—Risk Factors” of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2022. Any of the risks discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
including the risk factor included below, or any of the risks disclosed in “Item 1A — Risk Factors” of our Form
10-K, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially
and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or prospects.
Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry
As
a result of our historical lack of financial liquidity, we do not currently have sufficient working capital to fund our planned operations
and may not be able to continue as a going concern.
We
have a history of recurring losses, and as of January 31, 2023 we have incurred a cumulative net loss of $131,300,000. During the six
months ended January 31, 2023, we recorded a net loss of $2,053,000 on recorded net revenue of $868,000. In addition, during the six
months ended January 31, 2023 we used $1,906,000 in operating and investing activities resulting in a cash balance of $1,485,000 as of
January 31, 2023. As a result, our existing cash resources are not sufficient to meet our anticipated needs over the next twelve months
from the date hereof, and we will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations and to implement our business plan, which
capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
Our
capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others:
●
the market acceptance of,
and demand for, our products;
●
the timing and costs of
executing our sales and marketing strategies;
●
our ability to successfully
complete the in-plant validation trials requested by potential customers and our ability to convert these trials into customer orders
for our products;
●
the costs and time required
to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our products, including the required USDA approvals:
●
the extent to which we
invest in new testing and product development, including in-plant optimization trials;
●
the extent to which our
customers continue to place product orders as expected and expand their existing use of our products;
●
the cost and time to satisfy
unique customer requirements regarding validation trials or to support the value proposition and benefits of our products;
●
the timing of vendor payments
and the collection of receivables, among other factors affecting our working capital;
●
our ability to control
the timing and amount of our operating expenses, including the costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required to
implement our business plan; and
●
the costs to file, prosecute
and defend our intellectual property rights.
24
The
above factors, along with our history and near term forecast of incurring net losses and negative operating cash flows, raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we do not obtain additional capital from external sources, we will not have
sufficient working capital to fund our planned operations or be able to continue as a going concern. We cannot assure you that additional
financing will be available when needed or that, if available, we can obtain financing on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders.
If we raise additional funds from the issuance of equity securities, substantial dilution to our existing stockholders would likely result.
If we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well
as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business. Further, any contracts or license arrangements
we enter into to raise funds may require us to relinquish our rights to our products or technology, and we cannot assure you that we
will be able to enter into any such contracts or license arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all. Having insufficient funds may require
us to delay or scale back our marketing, distribution and other commercialization activities or cease our operations altogether.
