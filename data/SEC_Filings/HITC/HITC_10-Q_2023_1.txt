CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Report”) contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements discuss matters that are not historical facts. Because
they discuss future events or conditions, forward-looking statements may include words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
“estimate,” “intend,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “may,” “seek,”
“plan,” “might,” “will,” “expect,” “predict,” “project,” “forecast,”
“potential,” “continue,” negatives thereof or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are found
at various places throughout this Report and include information concerning: possible or assumed future results of our operations; business
strategies; future cash flows; financing plans; plans and objectives of management; any other statements regarding future operations,
future cash needs, business plans and future financial results; and any other statements that are not historical facts.
From
time to time, forward-looking statements also are included in our other periodic reports on Form 8-K, in our press releases, in our presentations,
on our website and in other materials released to the public. Any or all the forward-looking statements included in this Report and in
any other reports or public statements made by us are not guarantees of future performance and may turn out to be inaccurate. These forward-looking
statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions, and beliefs about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties,
and other factors. Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results
expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. Considering these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described
in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than we have described.
You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Report. All
subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning other matters addressed in this Report and attributable to us or any
person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this Report.
Except
to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from
new information, future events, a change in events, conditions, circumstances, or assumptions underlying such statements, or otherwise.
For
discussion of factors that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results see “ITEM
1A – RISK FACTORS” included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022 as filed with
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on September 23, 2022.

NOTES
TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE
1 –
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Healthcare
Integrated Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”)
is a healthcare technology company based in Knoxville, Tennessee. We are creating a diversified spectrum of healthcare technology solutions
to integrate and automate the continuing care, home care and professional healthcare spaces.
Our
initial product, SafeSpace™ with AI Vision™, is an ambient fall detection solution designed for continuing care communities
and at home use. SafeSpace includes hardware devices utilizing RGB, radar and other sensor technology coupled with our internally developed
software to effectively monitor a person remotely. In continuing care communities, SafeSpace detects resident falls and generates alerts
to a centralized, intelligent dashboard without the use of wearable devices or any action by the resident. In the home, SafeSpace detects
falls and sends alerts directly to designated individuals.
In
addition to SafeSpace, we are creating a home concierge healthcare service application to provide a virtual assisted living experience
for seniors, recently released postoperative patients, and others. The concierge application will enable the consumer to obtain home
healthcare services and health and safety monitoring equipment to improve quality of life. We are also working to develop a fully integrated
solution for the professional healthcare community that integrates electronic health records, remote patient monitoring, telehealth,
and other items where integration is beneficial.
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying interim consolidated financial statements include those of Healthcare Integrated Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries,
after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Accordingly, they do not contain
all information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the Company’s management,
the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements contain all of the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring
accruals) to fairly present the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2023 and the results of operations and cash flows
for the periods presented. The results of operations for the six months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the
operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
July 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on September 23, 2022.
Reclassifications
Certain
prior period amounts may be reclassified to conform to current period presentation with no changes to previously reported net loss or
stockholders’ deficit.
Risk
and Uncertainties
Factors
that could affect our future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from management’s expectation include,
but are not limited to: our ability to maintain and secure adequate capital to fund our operations and fully develop our product(s);
our ability to source strong opportunities with sufficient risk adjusted returns; acceptance of the terms and conditions of our licenses
and/or the acceptance of our royalties and fees; the nature and extent of competition from other companies that may reduce market share
and create pressure on pricing and investment return expectations; changes in the projects in which we plan to invest which result from
factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, a change in circumstances, capacity and economic impacts; changes in laws,
regulations, accounting, taxation, and other requirements affecting our operations and business. Negative developments in these or other
risk factors could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
F- 6
On
January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus
originating in Wuhan, China (the “COVID-19 outbreak”) and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally
beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure
globally. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report. As such, it is uncertain as to
the full magnitude that the pandemic will have on the Company’s future financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.
Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global situation on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry,
and workforce. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak and the global responses to curb its spread, the Company is not able
to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for fiscal year 2023.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those
estimates. We base our estimates on experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis and actual results may differ from those estimates.
Concentration
of Credit Risk
Financial
instruments that potentially expose the Company to credit risk consist of demand deposits with a financial institution. The Company is
exposed to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents in the event of default by the financial institution to the extent account balances
exceed the amount insured by the FDIC, which is $ 250,000 .
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
We
consider all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
The Company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution.
The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits. No loss has been experienced and management does not believe we are exposed
to any significant credit risk.
Accounts
Receivable
Accounts
receivable are stated at their historical carrying amount net of write-offs and allowance for uncollectible accounts. We routinely assess
the recoverability of all customer and other receivables to determine their collectability and record a reserve when, based on the judgement
of management, it is probably that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of the reserve may be reasonably estimated. When
collection is no longer pursued, we charge uncollectable accounts receivable against the reserve.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized
while minor replacements and maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the life of such assets, are charged to operations
as incurred. Disposals are removed at cost less accumulated depreciation, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the interim
consolidated statements of operations. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method which depreciates the assets over the
estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets ranging from five to seven years.
F- 7
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived
assets such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or whenever facts and
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When required, impairment losses on assets to be held and used
are recognized based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value
of similar assets, if available, or independent appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable,
an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. The Company did not recognize
any impairment losses for any periods presented.
Intangible
Assets
Intangible
assets consist of patents, our website and the costs of software developed for internal use. Certain payroll and stock-based compensation
costs incurred are allocated to the intangible assets. We determine the amount of costs to be capitalized based on the time spent by
employees or outside contractors on the projects. Intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful life on a straight-line
basis. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. If the estimate of an intangible asset’s remaining life is changed,
the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. We did not recognize
any impairment losses during any of the periods presented.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between
market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as
follows:
Level
1 Inputs – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the
measurement date.
Level
2 Inputs – Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets
or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as
interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market
data by correlation or other means.
Level
3 Inputs – Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity’s own assumptions
about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.
Financial
instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and borrowings. The fair value of current financial
assets and current financial liabilities approximates their carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
Derivative
Liability
Options,
warrants, convertible notes, or other contracts, if any, are evaluated to determine if those contracts, or embedded components of those
contracts, qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 815,
“Derivatives and Hedging,”
(paragraph 815-10-05-4
and Section 815-40-25). The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is marked-to-market
each balance sheet date and recorded as either an asset or a liability. The change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements
of operations as other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or cancellation of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked
to fair value at the date of conversion, exercise, or cancellation and then the related fair value is reclassified to equity.
F- 8
In
circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated, and there are also other
embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments
are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument.
The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed
at the end of each reporting period. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification
are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. Derivative instrument liabilities will
be classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is expected
within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
The
Company adopted Section 815-40-15 of the FASB ASC
(“Section 815-40-15”)
to determine whether an instrument (or an
embedded feature) is indexed to the Company’s own stock. Section 815-40-15 provides that an entity should use a two- step approach
to evaluate whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock, including evaluating the
instrument’s contingent exercise and settlement provisions.
We
utilize a binomial option pricing model to compute the fair value of the derivative liability and to mark to market the fair value of
the derivative liability at each balance sheet date. We record the change in the fair value of the derivative liability as other income
or expense in the interim consolidated statements of operations.
The
Company had derivative liabilities of $ 216,082
and $ 76,451
as January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company’s revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, “ Revenue from Contracts with
Customers. ” The Company follows the five-step model provided by ASC Topic 606 in order to recognize revenue in the following
manner: 1) Identify the contract; 2) Identify the performance obligations of the contract; 3) Determine the transaction price of the
contract; 4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) Recognize revenue. An entity recognizes revenue for
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s revenue recognition policies remained unchanged as a result
of the adoption of ASC 606, and there were no significant changes in business processes or systems.
Advertising
and Marketing
Advertising
and marketing costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 720-35, “ Advertising Costs .” We incurred advertising
and marketing costs of $ 3,793
and $ 14,826
for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are included in selling,
general and administrative expenses on the interim consolidated financial statements.
Net
Loss Per Common Share
We
determine basic loss per share and diluted income (loss) per share in accordance with the provisions of ASC 260, “ Earnings Per
Share .” Basic loss per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The calculation of diluted loss per share is similar to that of
basic earnings per share, except the denominator is increased, if the earnings are positive, to include the number of additional common
shares that would have been outstanding if all potentially dilutive common shares had been exercised.
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, “ Compensation – Stock Compensation”
(“ASC 718”) which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation. It
defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. The Company accounts for compensation
cost for stock option plans, if any, in accordance with ASC 718.
F- 9
Stock-based
payments, excluding restricted stock, are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Grants of stock-based payment awards issued
to non-employees for services rendered have been recorded at the fair value of the stock-based payment, which is the more readily determinable
value. The grants are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally the vesting period. If
an award is granted, but vesting does not occur, any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed in the period related to the
termination of service. Stock-based compensation expense is included in cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses,
depending on the nature of the services provided, in the interim consolidated statements of operations. Stock-based payments issued to
placement agents are classified as a direct cost of a stock offering and are recorded as a reduction in additional paid in capital.
The
Company recognizes all forms of stock-based payments, including stock option grants, warrants and restricted stock grants, at their fair
value on the grant date, which are based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. See Note 12.
Business
Combinations
We
account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets
and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and that changes thereafter be
reflected in income (loss). The estimation of fair values of the assets and liabilities assumed involves several estimates and assumptions
that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded. The results of the acquired businesses are included in our results from
operations beginning from the day of acquisition.
Income
Taxes
We
use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with Topic 740,
“Income Taxes”.
Under
this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (1) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (2) deferred
tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements
or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance
is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is
more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
ASC
Topic 740-10-30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740-10-40 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. We have no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting
periods presented.
In
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“ CARES Act ”) was signed
into law in March 2020. The CARES Act lifts certain deduction limitations originally imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“ 2017
Tax Act ”). Corporate taxpayers may carryback net operating losses (NOLs) originating between 2018 and 2020 for up to five years,
which was not previously allowed under the 2017 Tax Act. The CARES Act also eliminates the 80% of taxable income limitations by allowing
corporate entities to fully utilize NOL carryforwards to offset taxable income in 2018, 2019 or 2020. Taxpayers may generally deduct
interest up to the sum of 50% of adjusted taxable income plus business interest income (30% limit under the 2017 Tax Act) for 2019 and
2020. The CARES Act allows taxpayers with alternative minimum tax credits to claim a refund in 2020 for the entire amount of the credits
instead of recovering the credits through refunds over a period of years, as originally enacted by the 2017 Tax Act.
In
addition, the CARES Act raises the corporate charitable deduction limit to 25% of taxable income and makes qualified improvement property
generally eligible for 15-year cost-recovery and 100% bonus depreciation. The enactment of the CARES Act did not result in any material
adjustments to our income tax provision for the reporting periods presented.

has evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements as issued by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”)
through the date these interim consolidated financial statements were available to be issued and found no recent accounting pronouncements
issued, but not yet effective, that when adopted, will have a material impact on the interim consolidated financial statements of the
Company.
NOTE

GOING CONCERN
The
accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation
of the Company as a going concern. The Company had net losses of $ 860,991
for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and $ 1,361,021
for
its most recent fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. As of January 31, 2023, the Company has minimal cash and a significant working capital
deficit. We have a history of losses, an accumulated deficit, have negative working capital and have not generated cash from our operations
to support a meaningful and ongoing business plan. It is management’s opinion that these conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
In
view of these matters, our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the development, marketing and sales of a viable
product to achieve a level of profitability. We intend to finance our future development activities and our working capital needs from
the sale of private and public equity securities with additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes,
until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. Although the Company believes
in the viability of management’s strategy to generate sufficient revenue, control costs and the ability to raise additional capital,
there can be no assurances to that effect. Therefore, the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. The interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary
should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

5%
Convertible Promissory Notes
On
various dates during the month of March 2018, we issued a series of 5% Convertible Promissory Notes (collectively, the “5% Notes”)
totaling $ 750,000
in net proceeds. We incurred no costs related to the issuance of the 5% Notes. The 5% Notes bear interest at the rate
of five percent ( 5 %) per annum, compounded annually and
matured one-year from the date of issuance.
At January 31, 2023 and July 31,
2022, accrued but unpaid interest on the 5% Notes was $ 81,208
and $ 83,248 , respectively, which is included in “accounts payable
and accrued expenses” on our interim consolidated balance sheets.
The
5% Notes are convertible Into common shares of the Company at a fixed ratio of two shares of common stock per dollar amount of the face
value of the note.
The principal terms under which the 5% Notes may be converted into common stock of the Company are as follows:
●
At the option of the holder,
the outstanding principal amount of the note, and any accrued but unpaid interest due, may be converted into the Company’s
common stock at any time prior to the maturity date of the note.
●
The outstanding principal
amount of the note, and any accrued but unpaid interest due, will automatically be converted into the Company’s common stock
if at any time prior to the maturity date of the note, the Company concludes a sale of equity securities in a private offering resulting
in gross proceeds to the Company of at least $1,000,000.
5 %
Notes with a face amount of $ 50,000
and related accrued interest of $ 10,363
were converted into shares of our common stock during the
six months ended January 31, 2023 or. There were no 5% Notes converted into shares of our common stock during our latest fiscal year
ending July 31, 2022. At January 31, 2023,
5 % Notes with a face amount of $ 275,000
and related accrued interest expense of $ 73,789
are
currently in default and are not convertible under the conversion terms. Management is currently negotiating amendments to the notes
in default to extend the maturity dates of such notes and to encourage note conversions.
Note
Payable to Acorn Management Partners, LLC
On
August 11, 2020 we agreed to repurchase
1,000,000
shares of our common stock from Acorn Management Partners, LLC (“AMP”).
As consideration for the share repurchase, we issued a $ 50,000
promissory note bearing interest a
6.0 % per annum and due
one-year
from
the date of issuance (the “AMP Note”). The AMP Note was subsequently amended to extend the maturity date to March 31, 2023.
In the event we default under the terms of the AMP Note, we are required to deliver
1,000,000
shares of our common stock back to AMP
in full satisfaction of the obligation. The purchased shares were delivered by AMP directly to the transfer agent on September 8, 2020
and immediately cancelled. Accrued but unpaid interest on the AMP Note at January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 was $ 7,419
and $ 5,919 , respectively,
which is included in “accounts payable and accrued expenses” on our interim consolidated balance sheets.
Note
Payable to AJB Capital Investments, LLC
On
February 2, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with AJB Capital Investments, LLC (“AJB Capital”), pursuant
to which AJB Capital purchased a Promissory Note (the “AJB Note 1”) in the principal amount of $ 360,000
for an aggregate
purchase price of $ 320,400 . The AJB Note 1 accrued interest at the rate of ten percent ( 10 %) per annum and matured on
August 2, 2021 .
At our option, the maturity date of the note was extended for six (6) months. Upon extension of the maturity date, the AJB Note 1 interest
rate increased to twelve percent ( 12 %) per annum during the extension period. We recorded a debt discount of $ 59,300
related to original
issue discount and issuance cost of the note. The principal balance of the AJB Note 1 was paid in full on February 9, 2022 with a portion
of the net proceeds from the issuance of a new note to AJB Capital on such date.
On
February 9, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with AJB Capital, pursuant to which AJB Capital purchased a Promissory
Note (the “AJB Note 2”) in the principal amount of $ 600,000
for an aggregate purchase price of $ 534,000 . The AJB Note 2 accrues
interest at the rate of ten percent ( 10 %) per annum and matures on
February 9, 2023 . We recorded a debt discount of $ 96,000
related to
original issue discount and issuance cost of the note.
F- 13
In
the event of default, the AJB Note 2 may be converted into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to
the lesser of the lowest trading price (i) during the previous twenty (20) trading day period ending on the issuance date of the note,
or (ii) during the previous twenty (20) trading day period ending on the date of conversion of the note. We recorded a debt discount
of $ 192,886
related to the conversion feature of the AJB Note 2.
As
additional consideration for the purchase of the AJB Note 2, we issued AJB Capital
1,500,000
common stock purchase warrants (the “Warrants”)
giving AJB Capital the option to purchase up to
1,500,000
shares of our common stock at a price of $ 0.10
per share. At the option of
AJB Capital,
1,000,000
of the Warrants may be exercised on a “cashless” basis pursuant to a formula included in the Warrant.
The $ 99,905
grant date fair value of the Warrants was recorded as a debt discount.
Total
unamortized debt discount related to the AJB Capital notes at January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 was $- 0 - and $ 194,395 , respectively.
During the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, amortization of the debt discount was $ 194,395
and $ 90,000 , respectively. Debt
discount is included as a component of interest expense in the interim consolidated statements of operations.

DERIVATIVE LIABILITY
On
February 2, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with AJB Capital Investments, LLC (“AJB Capital”), pursuant
to which AJB Capital purchased a Promissory Note (the “AJB Note 1”) in the principal amount of $ 360,000
for an aggregate
purchase price of $ 320,400 . The note was fully repaid on February 9, 2022.
On
February 9, 2022, we entered into a new Securities Purchase Agreement with AJB Capital, pursuant to which AJB Capital purchased a Promissory
Note (the “AJB Note 2”) in the principal amount of $ 600,000
for an aggregate purchase price of $ 534,000
(See Note 7).
In
the event of default, the AJB Capital notes may be converted into shares of the Company’s common stock. We identified certain conversion
features embedded in the AJB Capital notes that represent derivative liabilities.
The
following table summarizes the changes in fair value, including transfers in and/or out, of all financial assets and liabilities measured

In
assessing the realizable value of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become tax deductible. Based on management’s assessment
of objective and subjective evidence, we have concluded at this time it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax asset will
not be realized and we have provided a valuation allowance for the entire amount of the deferred tax asset. At July 31, 2022, our most
recently completed fiscal year, we have approximately $ 3.59
million in federal and state net operating loss carryovers that begin
expiring
in fiscal 2037 .
We
conduct business solely in the United States and file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction as well as in the
states of Tennessee and Colorado. The taxable years ended July 31, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 remain open to examination by the
taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
The
Company evaluated the provisions of ASC 740 related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s
financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, present, and disclose uncertain positions
that the Company has taken or expects to take in its tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not
to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return
and the net benefit recognized and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as “unrecognized benefits.” A
liability is recognized (or amount of net operating loss carry forward or amount of tax refundable is reduced) for unrecognized tax benefit
because it represents an enterprise’s potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized
as a result of applying the provisions of ASC 740.
If
applicable, interest costs related to the unrecognized tax benefits are required to be calculated and would be classified as “Other
expenses – Interest expense” in the consolidated statements of operations. Penalties would be recognized as a component of
“General and administrative.”
No
material interest or penalties on unpaid tax were recorded during the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. As of January 31, 2023
and July 31, 2022,
no
liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported. The Company does not expect any significant
changes in its unrecognized tax benefits in the next fiscal year.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
To
continue operations and meet operating cash requirements, we have periodically relied on short term loans from related parties, primarily
shareholders, until such time as our cash flow from operations meets our cash requirements, or we are able to obtain adequate financing
through sales of our equity securities and/or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support
by shareholders or others. Amounts loaned primarily relate to amounts paid to vendors. The loans are considered temporary in nature and
have not been formalized by any written agreement. As of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, related parties were owed $ 333,231
and $ 267,765 ,
respectively, which are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses, related party on the interim consolidated balance sheets –
see Note 5. The amounts owed are payable on demand and carry no interest. The amounts and terms of the related party loans may not necessarily
be indicative of the amounts and terms that would have been incurred had comparable transactions been entered into with independent third
parties.
Effective
May 1, 2021, we entered into a Non-Employee Chief Executive Officer Engagement Agreement (the “Contract CEO Agreement”) with
Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC (“Platinum Equity”), a related party, to provide the services of our CEO and Chairman of the
Board of Directors. At January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, we owed Platinum Equity $ 535,250

Executive
Overview
Healthcare
Integrated Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries is a healthcare technology company based in Knoxville, Tennessee. We are creating
a diversified spectrum of healthcare technology solutions to integrate and automate the continuing care, home care and professional healthcare
spaces.
Our
initial product, SafeSpace™ with AI Vision™, is an ambient fall detection solution designed for continuing care communities
and at home use. SafeSpace includes hardware devices utilizing RGB, radar and other sensor technology coupled with our internally developed
software to effectively monitor a person remotely. In continuing care communities, SafeSpace detects resident falls and generates alerts
to a centralized, intelligent dashboard without the use of wearable devices or any action by the resident. In the home, SafeSpace detects
falls and sends alerts directly to designated individuals.
In
addition to SafeSpace, we are creating a home concierge healthcare service application to provide a virtual assisted living experience
for seniors, recently released postoperative patients, and others. The concierge application will enable the consumer to obtain home
healthcare services and health and safety monitoring equipment to improve quality of life. We are also working to develop a fully integrated
solution for the professional healthcare community that integrates electronic health records, remote patient monitoring, telehealth,
and other items where integration is beneficial.
Strategy
Our
mission is to grow a profitable healthcare technology company by focusing on our core product, continuing the development of our proprietary
software, and developing new uses and product lines for our technology. Our management team is focused on maintaining the financial flexibility
and assembling the right complement of personnel and outside consultants required to successfully execute our mission.

Stock-based Compensation–-
Stock-based
compensation expense decreased $55,892, or 38%, from the same period in the prior year. The decrease results from a 2023 reduction in
the amortization of the grant date fair value of employee stock options granted to our CEO and a restricted stock grant to our CFO, which
was partially offset by the expense related to the issuance of new shares and restricted stock grants to outside consultants.
Professional Fees -
Professional fees decreased
$5,927, or 18%, over the 2022 amount. In 2023, fees paid to outside consultants decreased by $6,870, which was partially offset by a small
net increase in other professional fees such as accounting, legal, transfer agent and Edgar processing fees.
Advertising
and Marketing -
Advertising and marketing expense decreased $4,122 over 2022. The decrease is primarily due to the elimination of
a contract sales and marketing representative in 2023.
Depreciation
and Amortization
- Depreciation and amortization expense increased $6,916 over the same period in the prior year. The increase
primarily results from the abandonment of a patent in 2023 which was partially offset by declining depreciation and amortization
expense as older assets become fully expensed and/or disposed of.

Expense
- Interest expense increased $13,579, or 13%, over the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to increased
amortization of the debt discount associated with the new AJB Note 2 and an increase in the monthly coupon interest on the larger principal
balance of the AJB Note 2.
Change
in Fair Value of Derivative Liability
- The change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities associated with our AJB Capital
notes reflect a current period gain of $156,894 as compared to a gain of $26,794 in the prior period. The current period gain resulted
from a decrease in the fair value of the derivative liability on the new AJB Capital note during the current three month period.

Officers’
Salaries -
Officers’ salaries, net of capitalized amounts, decreased $7,715 from 2022, or 3%. The decrease resulted from a
bonus being paid to our CFO in 2022.
Stock-based Compensation -
Stock-based compensation
expense decreased $133,558, or 45%, from the same period in the prior year. The decrease results from a 2023 reduction in the amortization
of the grant date fair value of employee stock options granted to our CEO and a restricted stock grant to our CFO, which was partially

Professional Fees -
Professional fees decreased
$17,903, or 23%, over the 2022 amount. In 2023, fees paid to outside consultants decreased $16,990 and accounting fees decreased $2,305
over the same period in the prior year. The decreases in consulting and accounting fees were partially offset by small increases in legal,
transfer agent and Edgar processing fees.
Advertising
and Marketing -
Advertising and marketing expense decreased $11,033, or 74%, over 2022. The decrease is primarily due to the elimination
of a contract sales and marketing representative in 2023.
Depreciation

- Depreciation and amortization expense increased $6,292 over the same period in the prior year. The increase primarily
results from the abandonment of a patent which was partially offset by declining depreciation expense as older assets become fully depreciated

Current
assets for the interim period ended January 31, 2023 decreased $2,312 as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. The decrease
is due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and the amortization of prepaid expenses.
Current
liabilities for the interim period ended January 31, 2023 increased $687,776 as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. The
increase is due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, short-term loans from related parties to meet cash flow needs,
the continuing accrual of officer’s compensation, new proceeds from the AJB Note 2 and an increase in the fair value of derivative
liabilities. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in convertible notes due to note conversions to common stock during the
period.
7
Net
Cash Used by Operating Activities
We
currently do not have a revenue source and will continue to have negative cash flow from operations for the near future. The factors
in determining operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, except for non-cash expenses such as depreciation
and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of debt discount, and changes in fair value of assets and liabilities, which
affect earnings but do not affect operating cash flow. Net cash used by operating activities was $60,891 for the six months ended January
31, 2023 as compared to $103,868 for the six months ended January 31, 2022. The $42,977 decrease in cash used by operating activities
during 2023 is primarily attributable to accrued interest expense and an overall effort by management to reduce operating costs.
Net
Cash Used by Investing Activities
Net
cash used by investing activities was $5,610 and $25,022 for the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount
is comprised of cash paid for the filing of patent applications and for the development of software for our internal use.
Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net
cash provided by financing activities was $65,466 for the six months ended January 31, 2023, which represents a $52,109 decrease over
the same period of 2022. The decrease from 2022 is primarily due to a $25,000 decline in proceeds from stock subscriptions and a net
cash decrease of $27,109 from related party loan and repayment transactions.
At
this time, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding from debt financings and/or
the sale of our equity securities to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. We are likely to continue using short-term loans
from management to meet our short-term funding needs. We have no material commitments for capital expenditures as of January 31, 2023.
Going
Concern Qualification
We
have a history of losses, an accumulated deficit, a negative working capital and have not generated cash from operations to support a
meaningful and ongoing business plan. Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm has included a “Going Concern Qualification”
in their report for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021. The foregoing raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern. We intend on financing our future activities and working capital needs from the sale of private and/or
public equity securities with additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, until such time that
funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. There is no guarantee that additional capital or debt
financing will be available when and to the extent required, or that if available, it will be on terms acceptable to us. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The “Going Concern
Qualification” might make it more difficult to raise capital.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our
interim consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP
requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on
the assets, liabilities, revenues and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in
our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates
and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to U.S. GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation
of our financial statements.
8
Our
significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of our interim consolidated financial statements.
There
have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” included in our July 31, 2022 Annual Report.
We
believe the following critical policies impact our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. We base our estimates on experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis and actual results may differ from those estimates.
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived
assets such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When required, impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on
the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets, if
available, or independent appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted
cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. When fair values
are not available, we estimate fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated
with the recovery of the assets. We did not recognize any impairment losses for any periods presented.
Intangible
Assets
Intangible
assets consist of patents, our website and the costs of software developed for internal use. Certain payroll and stock-based compensation
costs incurred are allocated to the intangible assets. We determine the amount of costs to be capitalized based on the time spent by
employees or outside contractors on the projects. Intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful life on a straight-line
basis. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. If the estimate of an intangible asset’s remaining life is changed,
the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. We did not recognize
any impairment losses during any of the periods presented.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between
market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as
follows:
Level
1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the
measurement date.
Level
2 Inputs - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets
or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as
interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market
data by correlation or other means.
9
Level
3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity’s own assumptions
about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.
Financial
instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and borrowings. The fair value of current financial
assets and current financial liabilities approximates their carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
Derivative
Liability
Options,
warrants, convertible notes, or other contracts, if any, are evaluated to determine if those contracts, or embedded components of those
contracts, qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 815,
“Derivatives and Hedging,”
(paragraph 815-10-05-4
and Section 815-40-25). The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is marked-to-market
each balance sheet date and recorded as either an asset or a liability. The change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements
of operations as other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or cancellation of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked
to fair value at the date of conversion, exercise, or cancellation and then the related fair value is reclassified to equity.
In
circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated, and there are also other
embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments
are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument.
The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed
at the end of each reporting period. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification
are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. Derivative instrument liabilities will
be classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument
is expected within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
The
Company adopted Section 815-40-15 of the FASB ASC
(“Section 815-40-15”)
to determine whether an instrument (or an
embedded feature) is indexed to the Company’s own stock. Section 815-40-15 provides that an entity should use a two- step approach
to evaluate whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock, including evaluating the
instrument’s contingent exercise and settlement provisions.
We
utilize a binomial option pricing model to compute the fair value of the derivative liability and to mark to market the fair value of
the derivative at each balance sheet date. We record the change in the fair value of the derivative as other income or expense in the
consolidated statements of operations.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company’s revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, “ Revenue from Contracts with
Customers. ” The Company follows the five-step model provided by ASC Topic 606 in order to recognize revenue in the following
manner: 1) Identify the contract; 2) Identify the performance obligations of the contract; 3) Determine the transaction price of the
contract; 4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) Recognize revenue. An entity recognizes revenue for
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s revenue recognition policies remained unchanged as a result
of the adoption of ASC 606, and there were no significant changes in business processes or systems.
Stock-based
Compensation
The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, “ Compensation – Stock Compensation”
(“ASC 718”) which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation. It
defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. The Company accounts for compensation
cost for stock option plans, if any, in accordance with ASC 718.
10
Stock-based
payments, excluding restricted stock, are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Grants of stock-based payment awards issued
to non-employees for services rendered have been recorded at the fair value of the stock-based payment, which is the more readily determinable
value. The grants are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally the vesting period. If
an award is granted, but vesting does not occur, any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed in the period related to the
termination of service. Stock-based compensation expenses are included in cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses,
depending on the nature of the services provided, in the consolidated statements of operations. Stock-based payments issued to placement
agents are classified as a direct cost of a stock offering and are recorded as a reduction in additional paid in capital.
The
Company recognizes all forms of stock-based payments, including stock option grants, warrants and restricted stock grants, at their fair
value on the grant date, which are based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest.
Business
Combinations
We
account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets
and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and that changes thereafter be
reflected in income (loss). The estimation of fair values of the assets and liabilities assumed involves estimates and assumptions that
could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded. The results of the acquired businesses are included in our results from operations
beginning from the day of acquisition.
Capital
Resources
We
had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of January 31, 2023.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements as of January 31, 2023.
Item
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
We
do not hold any market risk sensitive instruments. We consider our interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest
rates on 100% of our debt. At January 31, 2023, there was no floating rate debt that would expose us to market fluctuations in interest
rates.
Item
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Disclosure
Controls and Procedures
Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at the end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation
Date”). In conducting its evaluation, management considered the material weaknesses described below in Management’s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Based
on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the Evaluation Date we did not
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that were effective in providing reasonable assurances that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange act of 1934 was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
prescribed by SEC rules and regulations, and that such information was accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.
11
Our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act,
during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
