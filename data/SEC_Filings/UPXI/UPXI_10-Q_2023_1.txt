These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry’s actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.   We operate in a rapidly changing environment and new risks emerge from time to time. As a result, it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, such as the COVID-19 outbreak and associated business disruptions including delayed clinical trials and laboratory resources, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Considering these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this report may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The forward-looking statements included in this report speak only as of the date hereof, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.   Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report.   In this quarterly report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to “common shares” refer to shares of our common stock.   As used in this quarterly report, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “our company” mean Upexi, Inc., unless otherwise indicated.     3 Table of Contents   PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION   Item 1.

VitaMedica is a leading online seller of supplements for surgery, recovery, skin, beauty, health, and wellness.   On October 1, 2021, the Company completed an equity interest purchase agreement with Gyprock Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, MFA Holdings Corp., a Florida corporation and Sherwood Ventures, LLC, a Texas limited liability company to acquire all of the outstanding membership interest of Interactive Offers, LLC, a Delaware limited liability corporation.   On  April 1, 2022, the Company completed a securities purchase agreement with a single investor to acquire 55% of the equity interest in Cygnet Online, LLC, a Delaware limited liability corporation. The agreement also enables the Company to purchase the remaining 45% over the following two years.     On August 12, 2022, the Company completed an asset purchase agreement with GA Solutions, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“LuckyTail”), pursuant to which the Company acquired substantially all assets of LuckyTail. LuckyTail sells pet nail grinders and other pet products through various sales channels including some international sales channels.    On October 31, 2022, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary Upexi Enterprise, LLC, completed a securities purchase agreement to purchase the outstanding stock of E-Core Technology, Inc. d/b/a New England Technology, Inc. (“E-Core”), a Florida corporation.  E-Core distributes non-owned branded products to national retail distributors and has branded products in the toy industry that E-Core sells direct to consumers through online sales channels and to national retail distributors.    Business Divested   On October 26, 2022, the Company executed a membership interest purchase agreement to sell  100 % of the membership interests of Infusionz LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“Infusionz”), included in the sale was all rights to Infusionz brands and the manufacturing of certain private label business.   Infusionz was originally purchased by the Company in July of 2020.  The divestiture of Infusionz and related private label manufacturing represents a strategic shift in our operations and will allow us to become a predominantly product distribution focused company for both our Company owned brands and non-owned brands. Accordingly, the results of the business were classified as discontinued operations in our condensed statements of operations and excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.   Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation   The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling financial interest as of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022.   10 Table of Contents   In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results.   Discontinued Operations   A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or that is classified as held for sale, which represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of options and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate line of business or geographical area of operations.  In accordance with the rules regarding the presentation of discontinued operations, the assets, liabilities, and activity of Infusionz and certain manufacturing business have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.    Fair Value of Financial Instruments   ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurement  (“ASC 820”), establishes a fair value hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguished between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumption about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.   ASC 820 identified fair value as the exchange price, or exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between the following:   Level 1—Quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted market prices, interest rates and yield curves.   Level 3—Unobservable inputs developed using estimates or assumptions developed by the Company, which reflect those that a market participant would use.   To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized as Level 3. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.   The carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values, due to their short-term nature.  For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, management believed it necessary to record a reserve against the debt and equity instruments obtained in the sale of Infusionz of $8,500,000.   Reclassification   Certain reclassifications have been made to the condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022, and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 to conform to the presentation as of and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022.   11 Table of Contents   Note 2.

4.06 %  Expected term     5   Expected volatility   70 - 77 %  Grant date stock price   $ 3.87  - $ 5.30     The basis for the above assumptions are as follows: the dividend rate is based upon the Company’s history of dividends; the risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant; the expected term was calculated based on the Company’s historical pattern of options granted and the period of time they are expected to be outstanding; and expected volatility was calculated based upon historical trends in the Company’s stock prices.   Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Based on historical experience of forfeitures, the Company estimated forfeitures at 0% for each of the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021.   Note 13. Income Taxes   The Company computed the year-to-date income tax provision by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to the year-to-date pre-tax income and adjusted for discrete tax items in the period. The Company’s income tax expense was $ 755,253
and $ 47,052  for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively and $ 26,162
and $ 235,033
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.   The income tax expense for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, was primarily attributable to federal and state income taxes and nondeductible expenses for an effective tax rate of approximately  29 %. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the difference between the U.S. statutory rate and the Company’s effective tax rate is due to the full valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax assets.   Future realization of the tax benefits of existing temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. The Company periodically evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence, both positive and negative. The Company also considered whether there was any currently available information about future years. The Company determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will have future taxable income to fully realize the Company’s deferred tax asset.   As of December 31, 2022, there was approximately $ 1,400,000
of losses available to reduce federal taxable income in future years and can be carried forward indefinitely.   Note 14. Risks and Uncertainties   There is substantial uncertainty and different interpretations among federal, state and local regulatory agencies, legislators, academics and businesses as to the scope of operation of Farm Bill-compliant hemp programs relative to the emerging regulation of cannabinoids. These different opinions include, but are not limited to, the regulation of cannabinoids by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and/or the FDA and the extent to which manufacturers of products containing Farm Bill-compliant cultivators and processors may engage in interstate commerce. The uncertainties cannot be resolved without further federal, and perhaps even state-level, legislation, regulation or a definitive judicial interpretation of existing legislation and rules. If these uncertainties continue, they may have an adverse effect upon the introduction of our products in different markets.   24 Table of Contents   In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) surfaced. The spread of COVID-19 around the world has caused significant volatility in U.S. and international markets.

The revenue growth was primarily the result of the three acquisitions and was offset from the sale of Infusionz.  The quarter did not include a complete three months of operations of E-Core as the acquisition was effective October 21, 2022.  Management believes that there is significant opportunity in the next 12 months for organic growth within the newly acquired business and will focus the acquisition targets on businesses that will enhance our current products or allow the business to accelerate growth.      Cost of revenue increased by $16,062,247 or 2,258% to $16,773,493 compared with cost of revenue of $711,246 in the same period last year.  The cost of revenue growth was primarily related to the acquisition of four companies and offset with the sale of Infusionz.  Gross profit increased by over $6,000,000 compared to the prior year.  Management will seek to improve the gross profit and the overall gross margin in the next 12 months as we are able to leverage the significant increase in our purchasing requirements and continue to consolidate our operations.
Sales and marketing expenses increased by $1,972,731 or 103% compared with the same period last year.  The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily related to the acquisitions, however management also increased the sales and marketing budget for the quarter in our direct to consumer sales channels as the Company capitalize on an opportunity to take advantage of lower costs to estimated life time value of the customer, while other companies were taking a more defensive wait and see approach.  Management believes that this strategy will yield significant returns in the next 12 months.  We anticipate our advertising expenses will be reduced in the following quarters, which will increase our overall profitability.      Distribution costs increased $2,753,915 or 335% compared with the same period last year.  The increase in distribution costs was primarily related to the three acquisitions, offset by the sale of Infusionz and the classification of these expenses as part of discontinued operations.  In addition, there were slight increases in transportation costs and third-party provider rates, which are expected to be short term and management has a strategy that will start to decrease the overall percentage of distribution costs to sales.   General and administrative expenses decreased by $93,264 or 3% compared with the same period last year.   As the Company has changed with the acquisitions and the sale of Infusionz, management has managed the general and administrative costs and will continue to implement strategies to decrease the percentage of general and administrative costs when compared to total sales.      Other operating expenses increased by $1,009,946 or 81% compared with the same period last year.  These expenses are primarily non-cash and increase based on the intangible assets created with acquisitions and the continued amortization of stock compensation.      During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had other income of $5,770,679 compared to an expense of $48,541 in the prior year.  The income was related to the gain recognized from the sale of Infusionz and select manufacturing business and offset with interest expenses incurred from the refinancing and early termination of debt obtained in June of 2022.

The spread of COVID-19 around the world has caused significant volatility in U.S. and international markets. There is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the U.S. and international economies and, as such, the Company has transitioned to a combination of work from home and social distancing operations. There has been minimal impact to our internal operations from the transition. The Company is unable to determine if there will be a material future impact to its customers’ operations and ultimately an impact to the Company’s overall revenues.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Not applicable.
31 Table of Contents   Item 4. Controls and Procedures   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of December 31, 2022 (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. This conclusion is based on findings that constituted material weaknesses. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.   In performing the above-referenced assessment, our management identified the following material weaknesses:     (i) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives.         (ii) lack of multiple levels of supervision and review.   We believe the weaknesses and their related risks are not uncommon in a company of our size because of the limitations in the size and number of staff. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties has not always been possible and may not be economically feasible.  However, we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes by the end of our 2023 fiscal year as resources allow:   (i) Appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and implement modifications to our financial controls to address such inadequacies; and         (ii) We will attempt to implement the remediation efforts set out herein by the end of the 2023 fiscal year.   Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Management believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.    Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 12a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within any company have been detected.     32 Table of Contents   PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1.
