Table of Contents AMREP CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Three and Nine Months Ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 (1)            SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by AMREP Corporation (the “Company”) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for interim financial information, and do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. The Company, through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in two business segments: land development and homebuilding. The Company has no foreign sales or activities outside the United States. Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to the Company in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q include the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary to reflect a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of what may occur in future periods. Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to 2023 and 2022 are to the fiscal years ending April 30, 2023 and 2022. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements herein should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on July 21, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”). To better align with industry practice, the Company reclassified public improvement district reimbursements, private infrastructure covenant reimbursements and a portion of miscellaneous other revenues representing payment for impact fee credits within building sales and other revenues in the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2022 as a reduction to land sale cost of revenues in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements to conform to the current period presentation with no effect on net income or shareholders’ equity. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The significant accounting policies used in preparing these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with the accounting policies described in the 2022 Form 10-K, except as follows: ● Land sale cost of revenues, net includes all direct acquisition costs and other costs specifically identified with the property, including pre-acquisition costs and capitalized real estate taxes and interest, and an allocation of certain common development costs associated with the entire project. Common development costs include the installation of utilities and roads, and may be based upon estimates of cost to complete. The allocation of costs is based on the estimated relative sales value of the individual parcels of land being sold to the total expected sales value for the unsold parcels of land in the applicable portion of the subdivision. Estimates and cost allocations are reviewed on a regular basis until a project is substantially completed, and are revised and reallocated as necessary on the basis of current estimates. Amounts received from public improvement districts, private infrastructure covenants and payments for impact fee credits reduce the amount of land sale cost of revenues. ● The Company offers homeowners a comprehensive third-party warranty on each home. Homes are generally covered by a ten-year warranty for qualified and defined structural defects, one year for defects and products used, and two years for electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning parts and labor. Estimates of the Company’s exposure to warranty claims are included within accrued expenses at the time home sale revenues are recognized. New Accounting Pronouncements There are no new accounting standards or updates to be adopted that the Company currently believes might have a significant impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ 7

The Company recognizes the known changes in the funded status of the pension plan in the period in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income, net of the related income tax effect. The Company recorded, net of tax, other comprehensive income of $ 65,000
and $ 67,000
during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 and $ 208,000
and $ 200,000
during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 to account for the net effect of changes to the pension liability. The Company funds the pension plan in compliance with IRS funding requirements. The Company did not make any contributions to the pension plan during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 or January 31, 2022. The Company recognized a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement expense of $ 2,336,000
during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 due to the Company’s defined benefit pension plan paying an aggregate of $ 4,653,000
in lump sum payouts of pension benefits to 96 former employees. Equity compensation plan Refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2022 Form 10-K for detail regarding the AMREP Corporation 2016 Equity Compensation Plan (the “Equity Plan”), including restricted common stock and an option to purchase shares of common stock granted thereunder. The summary of the restricted share award activity during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 presented below represents the maximum number of shares that could become vested after these dates: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​      ​ ​ ​ Number of Restricted share awards ​ Shares Non-vested as of April 30, 2022
21,500 Granted during the nine months ended January 31, 2023
14,600 Vested during the nine months ended January 31, 2023
( 9,833 ) Forfeited during the nine months ended January 31, 2023
— Non-vested as of January 31, 2023
26,267 ​ The Company recognized non-cash compensation expense related to the vesting of restricted shares of common stock net of forfeitures of $ 39,000
and $ 25,000
during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 and $ 101,000
and $ 72,000
during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022. As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, there was $ 143,000
and $ 111,000
of unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted shares of common stock previously issued under the Equity Plan that had not vested as of those dates, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting term not to exceed
three years . ​ In November 2021, the Company granted Christopher V. Vitale, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, an option to purchase
50,000
shares of common stock of the Company under the Equity Plan with an exercise price of $ 14.24
per share. As of January 31, 2023, the option had not been exercised, cancelled or forfeited. The Company recognized non-cash compensation expense related to the option of $ 13,000
and $ 38,000
during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and $ 16,000
during each of the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022. As of January 31, 2023, the option was out-of-the-money and therefore was not included in “weighted average number of common shares outstanding – diluted” when calculating diluted earnings per share. The option could be dilutive to earnings per share in the future. Director compensation non-cash expense, which is recognized for the expected annual grant of deferred common share units to non-employee members of the Company’s Board of Directors ratably over the director’s service in office during the calendar year, was $ 23,000
during each of the three months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 and $ 68,000
during each of the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022. As of January 31, 2023, there was $ 8,000
of accrued compensation expense related to the deferred stock units expected to be issued in December 2023. As of January 31, 2022, there was $ 8,000
of accrued compensation expense related to the deferred stock units issued in December 2022. ​ (11)           OTHER INCOME Other income during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 consists of $ 1,803,000
in connection with the sale of all of the Company’s minerals and mineral rights in and under approximately
147
surface acres of land in Brighton, Colorado. There was

12
Table of Contents income for the three months ended January 31, 2022. Other income during the nine months ended January 31, 2022 consists of $ 185,000
received in connection with a bankruptcy of a warranty provider, $ 45,000
of debt forgiveness with respect to a note payable and $ 30,000
received for a life insurance policy for a retired executive of the Company. ​ (12)          INCOME TAXES ​ Palm Coast Data Holdco, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, had previously been the owner of the Company’s fulfillment services business. During the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company converted Palm Coast Data Holdco, Inc. to a limited liability company and made an election to treat the limited liability company as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This resulted in a worthless stock deduction for tax purposes. As a result of the worthless stock deduction, the Company incurred an operating tax loss of $ 62,180,000 , yielding an income tax benefit of $ 13,058,000
for U.S. federal corporate income taxes and an income tax benefit of $ 3,013,000
for New Mexico state corporate income taxes. The Company expects its operations to generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the tax benefit of this tax loss. The full tax benefit expected from the Company’s worthless stock deduction was accrued during the three months ended January 31, 2023 and reflected as a reduction to the Company’s (benefit) provision for income taxes and an increase in deferred income taxes, net without any valuation allowance. ​ The Company did not provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, net with respect to the worthless stock deduction due to the Company’s belief that it is more likely than not based upon the available evidence that such deferred tax assets will be realized. In making this determination, the Company projected its future earnings (including currently unrealized gains on real estate inventory) for the future recoverability of such deferred tax assets. While the Company believes that it has utilized a reasonable method to make this valuation allowance determination, should factors and conditions differ materially from those used by the Company in making such determination (including if the Company does not generate sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize the tax benefit of the tax loss included in deferred income taxes, net), the actual realization of deferred tax assets could differ materially from the reported amounts. ​ This tax loss may be subject to audit and possible adjustment by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), which could result in a reversal of none, part or all of the income tax benefit or could result in a benefit higher than the amount recorded. If the IRS rejects or reduces the amount of the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction, the Company may have to pay additional cash income taxes, which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The Company cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of the tax benefit the Company will receive, if any. Under federal income tax law, net operating losses have an unlimited carryforward period and the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited to 80% of taxable income in any year during the carryforward period. ​ In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Company’s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if the Company experiences an “ownership change.” A Section 382 “ownership change” generally occurs if one or more shareholders or groups of shareholders who own at least 5% of the Company’s stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws in the United States. It is possible that any future ownership changes could have a material effect on the use of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes. ​ ​ (13)          RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company has experienced supply chain constraints, increases in the prices of building materials, shortages of skilled labor and delays in municipal approvals and inspections in both the land development business segment and homebuilding business segment, which have caused delays in construction and the realization of revenues and increases in cost of revenues. In addition, in response to inflation, the Federal Reserve increased benchmark interest rates during 2023 and has signaled it expects additional future interest rate increases, which has resulted in a significant increase in mortgage interest rates during 2023, impacting home affordability and consumer sentiment and tempering demand for new homes and finished residential lots. The rising cost of housing due to increases in average sales prices in recent years and the recent increases in mortgage interest rates, coupled with general inflation in the U.S. economy and other macroeconomic factors, have placed additional pressure on overall housing affordability and have caused many potential home buyers to pause and reconsider their housing choices. Given the affordability challenges described above and the resulting impact on demand, the Company has increased sales incentives on certain homes classified as homebuilding model inventory or homebuilding construction in process, opportunistically leased completed homes and slowed the pace of housing starts and land development projects. 13

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations AMREP Corporation (the “Company”), through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in two business segments: land development and homebuilding. The Company has no foreign sales or activities outside the United States. Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to the Company in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q include the Company and its subsidiaries. The following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The information contained in this Item 2 should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this report on Form 10-Q and with the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 21, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”). Many of the amounts and percentages presented in this Item 2 have been rounded for convenience of presentation. Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to 2023 and 2022 are to the fiscal years ending April 30, 2023 and 2022. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the accounting policies used and disclosed in the 2022 consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and included as part of the 2022 Form 10-K and in Note 1 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report on Form 10-Q. The preparation of those unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements required management to make estimates and assumptions that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts or results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 14
Table of Contents The Company’s critical accounting policies, assumptions and estimates are described in Item 7 of Part II of the 2022 Form 10-K. There have been no changes in these critical accounting policies. Information concerning the Company’s implementation and the impact of recent accounting standards or updates issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2022 Form 10-K. The Company did not adopt any accounting policy in the nine months ended January 31, 2023 that had a material effect on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company had net income of $16,574,000, or $3.12 per diluted share, compared to net income of $910,000, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the three months ended January 31, 2022. For the nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company had net income of $22,107,000, or $4.17 per diluted share, compared to net income of $5,873,000, or $0.80 per diluted share, for the nine months ended January 31, 2022. As discussed in more detail below, during the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company recognized a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement expense of $2,336,000 as a result of its defined benefit pension plan paying certain lump sum payouts of pension benefits to former employees and a non-cash income tax benefit of $16,071,000 as a result of a worthless stock deduction related to its former fulfillment services business. During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company has experienced supply chain constraints, increases in the prices of building materials, shortages of skilled labor and delays in municipal approvals and inspections in both the land development business segment and homebuilding business segment, which have caused delays in construction and the realization of revenues and increases in cost of revenues. In addition, in response to inflation, the Federal Reserve increased benchmark interest rates during 2023 and has signaled it expects additional future interest rate increases, which has resulted in a significant increase in mortgage interest rates during 2023, impacting home affordability and consumer sentiment and tempering demand for new homes and finished residential lots.

Given the affordability challenges described above and the resulting impact on demand, the Company has increased sales incentives on certain homes classified as homebuilding model inventory or homebuilding construction in process, opportunistically leased completed homes and slowed the pace of housing starts and land development projects. The Company believes these conditions will continue to impact the land development and homebuilding industries for at least the remainder of calendar year 2023. Revenues .

The Company did not record any non-cash impairment charges on real estate inventory or investment assets for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 or January 31, 2022. Due to volatility in market conditions and development costs, the Company may experience future impairment charges. ● The change in homebuilding general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior periods was primarily due to hiring additional employees. ● The change in corporate general and administrative expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior period was primarily due to increases in pension benefit expenses. The change in corporate general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the prior period was primarily due to decreases in office rent and expenses and depreciation.
● The pension settlement expense was a result of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan paying an aggregate of $4,653,000 in lump sum payouts of pension benefits to 96 former employees. No such pension settlement expense was incurred in the same periods of 2022. Interest income, net . Interest income, net for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 was higher than the prior period by $6,000 primarily due to interest earned in connection with a refund of federal income taxes. 18
Table of Contents Other income . Refer to Note 11 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report on Form 10-Q for detail regarding other income. Provision for income taxes . The Company had a benefit for income taxes of $15,246,000 and $13,734,000 for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to a provision for income taxes of $248,000 and $1,701,000 for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022. The benefit for income taxes for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 was primarily due to the income tax benefit related to the Company’s worthless stock deduction offset in part by income taxes for the amount of income before income taxes during each period. The provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022 correlated to the amount of income before income taxes during each period. Refer to Note 12 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report on Form 10-Q for detail regarding the Company’s worthless stock deduction. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $12,403,000 and $15,721,000 as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022. AMREP Corporation is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries. As a holding company, AMREP Corporation is dependent on its available cash and on cash from subsidiaries to pay expenses and fund operations. The Company’s liquidity is affected by many factors, including some that are based on normal operations and some that are related to the real estate industry and the economy generally.
The Company’s primary sources of funding for working capital requirements are cash flow from operations, bank financing for specific real estate projects, a revolving line of credit and existing cash balances. Land and homebuilding properties generally cannot be sold quickly, and the ability of the Company to sell properties has been and will continue to be affected by market conditions. The ability of the Company to generate cash flow from operations is primarily dependent upon its ability to sell the properties it has selected for disposition at the prices and within the timeframes the Company has established for each property. The development of additional lots for sale, construction of homes or pursuing other real estate projects may require financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms (or at all). If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, the Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected. Except as described below, there have been no material changes to the Company’s liquidity and capital resources as reflected in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2022 Form 10-K.

The net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended January 31, 2022 was primarily due to cash generated from business operations offset in part by an increase in real estate inventory and investment assets and other assets and a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses and taxes payable. Investing Activities . The net cash used in investing activities for each of the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures of property and equipment. Financing Activities . The net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 was primarily due to principal debt repayments. The net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended January 31, 2022 was primarily due to proceeds from debt financing offset in part by principal debt repayments.

Table of Contents ● From April 30, 2022 to January 31, 2023: ● The change in other assets was primarily due to an increase in prepaid expenses related to a land development cash collateralized performance guaranty and stock compensation. ● The change in deferred income taxes, net was primarily due to the income tax effect of the Company’s worthless stock deduction offset in part by the income tax effect of the pension settlement expense related to lump sum payouts of pension benefits. Refer to Note 12 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report on Form 10-Q for detail regarding the Company’s worthless stock deduction and refer to Note 10 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report on Form 10-Q for detail regarding the pension settlement expense. ● The change in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to the payment of invoices offset in part by an increase in customer deposits. ● The change in taxes payable, net was primarily due to the payment of taxes offset by the elimination of the current year tax provision. ● The change in prepaid pension costs was primarily due to the funding levels of the Company’s frozen defined benefit pension plan. The Company recorded, net of tax, other comprehensive income of $65,000 and $208,000 for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and $67,000 and $200,000 for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2022 reflecting the change in accrued pension costs during each period net of the related deferred tax and unrecognized prepaid pension amounts.

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Finance and Accounting, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. As a result of such evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Finance and Accounting have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Finance and Accounting, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Company believes that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No change in the Company’s system of internal control over “financial reporting” (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. ​ PART II.
