FIRST REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST OF NEW JERSEY, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note 1 - Basis of presentation:
First Real Estate Investment Trust of New Jersey
was organized on November 1, 1961 as a New Jersey Business Trust. On July 1, 2021, First Real Estate Investment Trust of New Jersey completed
the change of its form of organization from a New Jersey real estate investment trust to a Maryland corporation (the “Reincorporation”)
which was approved by its stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders held on May 6, 2021. The Reincorporation changed the law
applicable to First Real Estate Investment Trust of New Jersey’s affairs from New Jersey law to Maryland law and was accomplished
by the merger of First Real Estate Investment Trust of New Jersey with and into its wholly owned subsidiary, First Real Estate Investment
Trust of New Jersey, Inc. (“FREIT”, “Trust”, “us”, “we”, “our” or the “Company”),
a Maryland corporation. As a result of the Reincorporation, the separate existence of First Real Estate Investment Trust of New Jersey
has ceased and FREIT has succeeded to all the business, properties, assets and liabilities of First Real Estate Investment Trust of New
Jersey. Holders of shares of beneficial interest in First Real Estate Investment Trust of New Jersey have received one newly issued share
of common stock of FREIT for each share of First Real Estate Investment Trust of New Jersey that they own, without any action of stockholders
required and all treasury stock held by First Real Estate Investment Trust of New Jersey was retired.
FREIT is organized and will continue to operate
in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and its stock is traded on
the over-the-counter market under the trading symbol FREVS.
The accompanying interim condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)
for interim financial statements and pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly,
certain information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements have been omitted. It is the opinion of management
that all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included, and that all such adjustments are of a normal recurring
nature.
The consolidated results of operations for the
three-month period ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other
period. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
and related notes included in FREIT’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022.
Note 2 - Recently issued accounting standard:
In March 2020 and January 2021, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-04 “ Reference
Rate Reform (ASC 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting ”, and ASU 2021-01 “ Reference
Rate Reform (ASC 848): Scope ” which provides temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference
rate reform in contracts and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to
be discontinued because of reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 are effective for all entities
as of March 12, 2020 through the recently deferred date of December 31, 2024. We currently do not anticipate the need to modify our existing
debt agreements as a result of reference rate reform in the current year, however if any modification is executed as a result of reference
rate reform, the Company will elect the optional expedient available under ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01, which allows entities to account
for the modification as if the modification was not substantial. We will disclose the nature of and reason for electing the optional expedient
in each interim and annual financial statement period if and when applicable through December 31, 2024.
Note 3 – Dividends and earnings per share:
The FREIT Board of Directors (“Board”)
declared a dividend of approximately $ 372,000
($ 0.05
per share) in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, which was paid on March 15, 2023
to stockholders of record on March 1, 2023.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing
net income attributable to common equity (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares and vested share units (See Note 14) outstanding
during each period (denominator). The calculation of diluted earnings per share is similar to that of basic earnings per share, except
that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if all potentially dilutive
shares, such as those issuable upon the exercise of stock options, were issued during the period using the Treasury Stock method. Under
the Treasury Stock method, the assumption is that the proceeds received upon exercise of the options, including the unrecognized stock
option compensation expense attributable to future services, are used to repurchase FREIT’s stock at the average market price during
the period, thereby increasing the number of shares to be added in computing diluted earnings per share. For the three months ended January
31, 2023, the outstanding stock options increased the average dilutive shares outstanding by approximately
9,000
shares with no impact
on earnings per share. For the three months ended January 31, 2022, the outstanding stock options increased the average dilutive shares
outstanding by approximately
63,000
shares with an impact of approximately $ 0.06
on earnings per share. There were no anti-dilutive shares
for
Index   Page
10
the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. Anti-dilutive shares consist of out-of-the money stock options under the Equity
Incentive Plan (See Note 13).
Note 4 - Interest rate cap and swap contracts:
In accordance with
“Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC 815")” , FREIT has been accounting for the Damascus Centre, LLC
(“Damascus Centre”), FREIT Regency, LLC (“Regency”), Wayne PSC, LLC (“Wayne PSC”) and Station Place
on Monmouth (“Station Place”) interest rate swaps and the Grande Rotunda, LLC (“Grande Rotunda”) interest rate
cap as cash flow hedges marking these contracts to market, taking into account present interest rates compared to the contracted fixed
rate over the life of the contract and recording the unrealized gain or loss on the swaps and cap in comprehensive income (loss).
On December
30, 2021, the property owned by Grande Rotunda was sold, a portion of the proceeds from the sale was used to pay off the $116.5 million
then outstanding balance of the underlying loan and the corresponding interest rate cap on this loan matured with no settlement due at
maturity. On January 10, 2022, the property owned by Damascus Centre was sold and a portion of the proceeds from the sale was used to
pay off the $18.2 million then outstanding balance of the underlying loan and the corresponding swap breakage fees of approximately $213,000
related to the early termination of the interest rate swap contracts on this loan which was included as interest expense on the accompanying
condensed consolidated statement of income for the three months ended January 31, 2022. (See Note 7 for further details on the sales of
these properties.) On June 17, 2022, Wayne PSC terminated its interest rate swap contract on its underlying loan held with People’s
United Bank, which had a maturity date of October 2026, for a settlement amount of approximately $1.4 million.
People’s United Bank
held the proceeds from this settlement in escrow until the underlying loan was paid off in July 2022. (See Note 9 for further details.)
For the three months ended January 31, 2023
and 2022, FREIT recorded an unrealized loss of approximately $ 450,000
and unrealized gain of $ 1,262,000 , respectively, in the condensed
consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income representing the change in the fair value of these cash flow hedges during such
periods. As of January 31, 2023, there was an asset of approximately $ 482,000
for the Regency swap and $ 477,000
for the Station Place
swap. As of October 31, 2022, there was an asset of approximately $ 611,000
for the Regency swap and $ 798,000
for the Station Place swap.
The fair values are based on observable inputs
(level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as provided by authoritative guidance).
Note 5 – Investment in tenancy-in-common:
On February 28, 2020, FREIT reorganized its
subsidiary S and A Commercial Associates Limited Partnership (“S&A”) from a partnership into a tenancy-in-common form
of ownership (“TIC”). Prior to this reorganization, FREIT owned a
65 % partnership interest in S&A, which owned
100 % of
the Pierre Towers property located in Hackensack, New Jersey through its
100 % interest in Pierre Towers, LLC. Pursuant to the TIC agreement,
FREIT ultimately acquired a
65 % undivided interest in the Pierre Towers property, which was formerly owned by S&A. Based on the guidance
of Accounting Standards Codification 810, “ Consolidation ”, FREIT’s investment in the TIC is accounted for under
the equity method of accounting. While FREIT’s effective ownership percentage interest in the Pierre Towers property remained unchanged
after the reorganization to a TIC, FREIT no longer had a controlling interest as the TIC is now under joint control.
FREIT’s investment in the TIC was approximately
$ 18.8
million at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022. For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, FREIT recognized a loss
on investment in TIC of approximately $ 67,000
and $ 124,000 , respectively, in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income.
Hekemian & Co., Inc. (“Hekemian &
Co.”) manages the Pierre Towers property pursuant to a management agreement between the owners of the TIC and Hekemian & Co.
dated as of February 28, 2020, which was for an initial term of one (1) year and which renews for successive one (1) year terms unless
either party gives written notice of termination to the other party at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current term.
The management agreement renewed for a successive one (1) year term on February 28, 2023 and will expire on February 28, 2024.
The management agreement requires the payment
of management fees equal to
5 % of rents collected. Management fees, charged to operations, were approximately $ 103,000
and $ 98,000
for
the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Pierre Towers property also uses the resources of the Hekemian &
Co. insurance department to secure various insurance coverages for its property. Hekemian & Co. is paid a commission for these services.
There were no such commissions, charged to operations, for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022.

Note 6 – Termination of Purchase and
Sale Agreement:
On February 4, 2022, the Superior Court of New
Jersey, Monmouth County (“Court”) entered an Order with respect to summary judgment motions filed by the parties in connection
with litigation between certain affiliates of FREIT (the “Sellers” or “Defendant”) and Sinatra Properties, LLC
(“Sinatra” or “Plaintiff”). The litigation relates to a Purchase and Sale Agreement entered into on January 14,
2020 (“PSA”) between the Sellers and Sinatra involving the sale by the Sellers of
100 % of their ownership interests in six
(6) real properties held by the Sellers.
The Court Order entered on February 4, 2022
(the “February 4 Order”) with respect to the Summary Judgment Motions provides as follows:
(1) The Court finds that the Plaintiff’s have breached the subject contract and the Court dismisses
all claims for relief filed by the Plaintiffs in this suit. The Court dismissed the Complaint and dismisses the Lis Pendens.
(2) The Court finds that the liquidated damage provision of the contract is not enforceable and the Court
Orders that the $ 15
million held in escrow be returned to the Plaintiff.
(3) The Court dismisses the Counterclaims and Third Party Complaint. All pleadings are dismissed.
Index   Page
12
On May 31, 2022, Sinatra filed a Motion for
Reconsideration with the Court, requesting that the Court reconsider its February 4, 2022 Order and, among other things, (a) grant Sinatra’s
motion for summary judgment, and (b) reverse the Court’s findings that (1) Sinatra breached the Purchase and Sale Agreement, (2)
the Sellers did not breach the Purchase and Sale Agreement and (3) the Court’s dismissal of the Complaint and Lis Pendens. On July
8, 2022, the Court denied Sinatra’s Motion for Reconsideration.
Following the February 4 Order, the Sellers
and the Purchaser each filed a motion for an award of attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Purchase
and Sale Agreement. On December 8, 2022 the Court entered an Order awarding Sellers $ 3,420,422.88
in attorneys’ fees and denying
the Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees (the “December 8 Order”). Upon entering the December 8 Order, the
Court had adjudicated all unresolved issues in the action.
On December 8, 2022, the Sellers filed a
Notice of Appeal, appealing from that portion of the February 4 Order which declined to enforce the liquidated damages provision in
the Purchase and Sale Agreement. As a result of such appeal by the Sellers, the liquidated damage amount of $ 15
million remains in
escrow and has not been returned to Sinatra.
On December 22, 2022, the Purchaser filed a
Notice of Cross Appeal appealing from all determinations by the Court adverse to the Purchaser, including (i) that portion of the February
4 Order holding that the Purchaser breached the contract; (ii) the denial of the Purchaser’s motion for reconsideration of the February
4 Order; and (iii) the December 8 Order awarding the Sellers $ 3,420,422.88
in attorneys’ fees and denying the Purchaser’s
request for attorneys’ fees.
The Sellers continue to believe that the allegations
set forth in the Complaint filed by Sinatra and in the Answer to Counterclaims and Third-Party Complaint and Affirmative Defenses filed
by Sinatra and Kushner Realty Acquisition LLC, are without merit.
Through the quarter ended January 31, 2023, the $ 15
million deposit and the $ 3,420,422.88
award of attorney’s fees have not been included in income in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income. Legal costs attributed to the legal proceeding between FREIT and certain of its affiliates and Sinatra Properties, LLC have been incurred in the amount of approximately $ 196,000
and $ 613,000
for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included in operating expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of income.
Note 7 – Maryland property dispositions:
On November 22, 2021, certain affiliates (the
“Maryland Sellers”) of FREIT entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Maryland Purchase and Sale Agreement”)
with MCB Acquisition Company, LLC (the “Maryland Purchaser”), a third party, pursuant to which the Maryland Sellers agreed
to sell three properties to the Maryland Purchaser. The properties consisted of retail and office space and a residential apartment community
owned by Grande Rotunda, LLC (the “Rotunda Property”), a shopping center owned by Damascus Centre, LLC (the “Damascus
Property”), and a shopping center owned by WestFREIT Corp. (the “Westridge Square Property”). FREIT owns
100 % of its
subsidiary, WestFREIT Corp. (“WestFREIT”), a
60 % interest in Grande Rotunda, LLC (“Grande Rotunda”), the joint
venture that owned the Rotunda Property, and a
70 % interest in Damascus Centre, LLC (“Damascus Centre”), the joint venture
that owned the Damascus Property.
The sale of the Maryland Properties having a
total net book value of $ 172.3
million (as adjusted) was consummated by the Maryland Sellers and the Maryland Purchaser for a purchase
price of $ 248,750,269 , after giving effect to the $ 15,526,731
escrow deposit (the “Maryland Purchaser Escrow Payment”).
This
sale resulted in net proceeds of approximately $53.9 million (inclusive of approximately $0.1 million in funds released during the first
quarter of Fiscal 2023 and $1.9 million in funds released from the Maryland Purchaser Escrow Payment during Fiscal 2022), after payment
of related mortgage debt in the amount of $155.8 million and the corresponding swap breakage fees of approximately $213,000 related to
the early termination of the interest rate swap contracts on the Damascus Property loan, payment of loans (including interest) to each
of the equity owners in Grande Rotunda in the amount of approximately $31 million and certain transactional expenses and transfer taxes
including brokerage fees due to Hekemian & Co. of approximately $6.2 million. As of January 31, 2023, approximately $2,070,000 of
the Maryland Purchaser Escrow Payment has been released from escrow to the Maryland Sellers. The escrow and related gain on sale were
reduced by approximately $0.4 million in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 and $1.2 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2022 due to
a change in estimate related to a change in the timing of anticipated rent commencement dates for certain tenants, which will reduce the
escrowed funds available to be released to Grande Rotunda. Approximately $6 million and $6.3 million of remaining funds are held in a
post-closing escrow for rents anticipated to be fully released in Fiscal 2023 and are included in “Funds held in post-closing escrow”
on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively. The sale of the Maryland
Properties resulted in a net gain of approximately $68.5 million (as adjusted by $0.3 million in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023) (with
a consolidated impact to FREIT of approximately $45.6 million) which includes approximately $8 million of proceeds released and anticipated
to be released from funds held in escrow, a write-off of the straight-line rent receivable of approximately $2.9 million and a write-off
of unamortized lease commissions of approximately $1.7 million.
On August 4, 2022, FREIT’s Board declared
a special, extraordinary, non-recurring cash distribution of approximately $ 51.5
million, or $ 7.50
per share, which was paid on August
30, 2022, to stockholders of record on August 16, 2022 (with an ex-dividend date of August 31, 2022). This distribution represented most
of the net proceeds of FREIT’s sale of its portfolio of Maryland Properties.
As the disposal of the Maryland Properties did
not represent a strategic shift that would have a major impact on FREIT’s operations or financial results, the properties’
operations were not reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

Note 8 - Management agreement, fees and transactions
with related party:
Hekemian & Co. currently
manages all of the properties owned by FREIT and its affiliates, except for the office building at the Rotunda Property, which was sold
on December 30, 2021 and was formerly managed by an independent third party management company. The management agreement between FREIT
and Hekemian & Co. dated as of November 1, 2001 (“Management Agreement”) expires on October 31, 2023 and is automatically
renewed for successive periods of two years unless either party gives not less than six (6) months prior notice of non-renewal.
The Management Agreement requires the payment
of management fees equal to
4 % to
5 % of rents collected. Such fees charged to operations were approximately $ 326,000
and $ 484,000
for
the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, the Management Agreement provides for the payment to Hekemian
& Co. of leasing commissions, as well as the reimbursement of certain operating expenses, such as payroll and insurance costs, incurred
on behalf of FREIT. Such commissions and reimbursements amounted to approximately $ 140,000
and $ 184,000
for the three months ended January
31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. FREIT also uses the resources of the Hekemian & Co. insurance department to secure various insurance
coverages for its properties and subsidiaries. Hekemian & Co. is paid a commission for these services. Such commissions, charged to
operations, were approximately $ 50,000
and $ 52,000
for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
From time to time, FREIT engages Hekemian &
Co., or certain affiliates of Hekemian & Co., to provide additional services, such as consulting services related to development,
property sales and financing activities of FREIT. Separate fee arrangements are negotiated between Hekemian & Co. and FREIT with respect
to such additional services. Such fees incurred for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $ 0
and $ 6,294,000 ,
respectively. Fees incurred during Fiscal 2022 related to commissions to Hekemian & Co. for the following: $ 4,777,000
for the sale
of the Rotunda Property; $ 917,000
for the sale of the Damascus Property; $ 525,000
for the sale of the Westridge Square Property; and $ 75,000
for the refinancing of the loan on the Boulders property. The commissions related to the sale of the Rotunda Property, the Damascus Property
and the Westridge Square Property were charged against the gain on sale of the Maryland Properties (See Note 7) in the accompanying condensed
consolidated statement of income for the three months ended January 31, 2022. The commission for the refinancing of the loan on the Boulders
property was a deferred mortgage cost included in the unamortized debt issuance costs in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance
sheets as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022.
The Management Agreement provides for a termination
fee (“Termination Fee”) in
the event of a termination by FREIT without cause and a termination fee of 1.25 times the Termination
Fee if the Management Agreement terminates following a merger or acquisition of FREIT (the “M&A Termination Fee”). On
March 9, 2023, the Board approved an amendment to the Management Agreement (the “Second Amendment”) which provides, among
other things, that the M&A Termination Fee shall be increased from 1.25 times the Termination Fee to 2.5 times the Termination Fee.
Robert S. Hekemian, Jr., Chief Executive Officer,
President and a Director of FREIT, is the Chief Executive Officer of Hekemian & Co. David B. Hekemian, a Director of FREIT, is the
President of Hekemian & Co. Allan Tubin, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of FREIT, is the Chief Financial Officer of Hekemian
& Co.
Director fee expense and/or executive compensation
(including interest and dividends) incurred by FREIT for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $ 141,000
and
$ 135,000 , respectively, for Robert S. Hekemian, Jr., $ 10,000
and $ 10,000 , respectively, for Allan Tubin and $ 13,000
and $ 15,000 , respectively,
for David Hekemian (See Note 14). Such costs are included within operating expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements
of income.
Note 9 – Mortgage financings and line
of credit:
On August 19, 2022, Westwood Hills, LLC exercised
its right, pursuant to the loan agreement, to extend the term of its $ 25
million loan on its property located in Westwood, New Jersey,
for an additional six (6) months from an initial maturity date of October 1, 2022 to a new maturity date of April 1, 2023. On March 1,
2023, Westwood Hills, LLC exercised its right, pursuant to the loan agreement, to extend the term of its loan, for an additional six (6)
months to a new maturity date of October 1, 2023 on the same terms and conditions as stated in the loan agreement. As of January 31, 2023,
$ 25,000,000
of this loan was drawn and outstanding and the interest rate was
8.37 %.
On July 22, 2022,
Wayne PSC, LLC (“Wayne
PSC”) refinanced its $22.1 million loan (inclusive of deferred interest of approximately $136,000), which would have matured on
October 1, 2026, on its Preakness Shopping center located in Wayne, New Jersey with a new loan held by ConnectOne Bank in the amount of
$25,000,000. This loan is interest-only based on a fixed interest rate of 5% and has a term of three years with a maturity date of August
1, 2025. Additionally, an interest reserve escrow was established at closing representing twelve months of interest of $1,250,000, which
can be used to pay monthly interest on this loan with a requirement to replenish the escrow account back to $1,250,000 when the balance
in the escrow account is reduced to three months of interest. This refinancing resulted in (i) annual debt service savings of approximately
$340,000 due to interest-only payments; (ii) an increase in the interest rate from a fixed interest rate of 3.625% to a fixed interest
rate of 5%; and (iii) net refinancing proceeds of approximately $1.1 million which can be used for capital expenditures and general corporate
purposes. As part of the refinancing, Wayne PSC terminated the interest rate swap contract on the underlying loan resulting in a realized
gain on the swap breakage of approximately
Index   Page
14
$1.4 million (See Note 4 for additional details.) As of January 31, 2023, the interest reserve
escrow account has a balance of approximately $611,000 .
On December 30, 2021, FREIT refinanced its $ 14.4
million loan (which would have matured on February 1, 2022) with a new loan held by ConnectOne Bank in the amount of $ 7,500,000 , with
additional funding available to be drawn upon in the amount of $ 7,500,000
for corporate needs. This loan is interest-only and has a maturity
date of
January 1, 2024
with the option of FREIT to extend for one year from the maturity date, subject to certain provisions of the loan
agreement. This refinancing will provide annual debt service savings of approximately $ 1,173,000
as a result of the reduction in the principal
amount, a reduction in the annual interest rate from a fixed rate of
5.37 % to a fixed rate of
2.85 % and interest-only payments being required
under this new loan. As of January 31, 2023, $ 7,500,000
of this loan was drawn and outstanding.
FREIT’s revolving line of credit provided
by the Provident Bank was renewed for a three-year term ending on October 31, 2023. Draws against the credit line can be used for working
capital needs and standby letters of credit. Draws against the credit line are secured by mortgages on FREIT’s Franklin Crossing
Shopping Center in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey and retail space in Glen Rock, New Jersey. The total line of credit is $ 13
million and the
interest rate on the amount outstanding is based on a floating interest rate of prime minus 25 basis points with a floor of
3.75 %. As
of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, there was
no
amount outstanding and $ 13
million was available under the line of credit.
While FREIT intends to renew or refinance its
debt obligations as they become due, there can be no assurance that it will be successful or, if successful, that the new terms will be
similar to the terms of its existing debt obligations or as favorable.
Note 10 – Fair value of long-term debt:
The following table shows the estimated fair
value and net carrying value of FREIT’s long-term debt at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022:

significantly affect these fair value estimates. The fair value is based on observable inputs (level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as
provided by authoritative guidance).
Note 11 - Segment information:
ASC 280-10, "Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information", establishes standards for reporting financial information about operating segments in
interim and annual financial reports and provides for a "management approach" in identifying the reportable segments. FREIT
has determined that it has two reportable segments: commercial properties and residential properties. These reportable segments offer
different types of space, have different types of tenants, and are managed separately because each requires different operating strategies
and management expertise. The commercial segment is comprised of five (5) properties, excluding the Rotunda Property, the Westridge Square
Property and the Damascus Property, which were sold on December 30, 2021, January 7, 2022 and January 10, 2022, respectively. The residential
segment is comprised of six (6) properties, excluding the Icon at the Rotunda Property, which was sold as part of the Maryland Properties
on December 30, 2021. (See Note 7 for further details.)
The accounting policies of the segments are
the same as those described in Note 1 in FREIT’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. The chief
operating and decision-making group responsible for oversight and strategic decisions of FREIT's commercial segment, residential segment
and corporate/other is comprised of FREIT’s Board.
FREIT, through its chief operating and decision
making group, assesses and measures segment operating results based on net operating income ("NOI"). NOI, a standard used by
real estate professionals, is based on operating revenue and expenses directly associated with the operations of the real estate properties,
but excludes: deferred rents (straight lining), depreciation, financing costs and other items. NOI is not a measure of operating results
or cash flows from operating activities as measured by GAAP, and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and
should not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

Note 12 – Income
taxes:
FREIT has elected to be treated as a REIT for
federal income tax purposes and as such intends to distribute at least
90 % of its ordinary taxable income (to maintain its status as a
REIT) to its stockholders as dividends for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2023. FREIT distributed approximately
143.8 % of its ordinary
taxable income and
100 % of its capital gains from the sale of the Maryland Properties to its stockholders as dividends for the fiscal
year ended October 31, 2022. Accordingly, no provision for federal or state income taxes related to such ordinary taxable income and such
gains were recorded in FREIT’s condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022.
As of January 31, 2023, FREIT had no material
uncertain income tax positions. The tax years subsequent to and including the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019 remain open to examination
by the major taxing jurisdictions.

of unrecognized compensation cost relating to outstanding non-vested stock options to be recognized
over the remaining weighted average vesting period of approximately
0.4
years. The aggregate intrinsic value of options vested and expected
to vest and options exercisable at January 31, 2023 was approximately $ 81,000
and $ 17,000 , respectively. For the three months ended January
31, 2023,
112,900
options were exercised for an aggregate amount of approximately $ 1.2
million.
Note 14 – Deferred
fee plan:
On September 4, 2014, the Board approved amendments,
effective November 1, 2014, to the FREIT Deferred Fee Plan for its executive officers and directors, one of which provides for the issuance
of share units payable in FREIT shares in respect of (i) deferred amounts of all director fees on a prospective basis; (ii) interest on
director fees deferred prior to November 1, 2014 (payable at a floating rate, adjusted quarterly, based on the average
10 -year Treasury
Bond interest rate plus
150
basis points); and (iii) dividends payable in respect of share units allocated to participants in the Deferred
Fee Plan as a result of deferrals described above. The number of share units credited to a participant’s account was determined
by the closing price of FREIT shares on the date as set forth in the Deferred Fee Plan.
For the three months ended January 31, 2023
and 2022, the aggregate amounts of deferred director fees together with related interest and dividends were approximately $ 26,500
and
$ 61,600 , respectively, which have been paid through the issuance of
1,630
and
2,496
vested FREIT share units, respectively, based on
the closing price of FREIT shares on the dates as set forth in the Deferred Fee Plan. For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and
2022, FREIT has charged as expense approximately $ 26,500
and $ 43,800 , respectively, representing deferred director fees and interest,
and the balance of approximately $ 0
and $ 17,000 , respectively, representing dividends payable in respect of share units allocated to
Plan participants, has been charged to equity.
On November 4, 2021 (the “Adoption Date”),
the Board approved the termination of the Deferred Fee Plan resulting in the termination of the deferral of fees on December 31, 2021
with any subsequent fees earned by a participant being paid in cash. Consistent with the termination of the Deferred Fee Plan, payment
related to each participant’s cash account (in the form of a cash lump sum payment) and share unit account (in the form of the issuance
of common stock) (collectively “the Deferred Fee Plan Termination Payment”) must be made to each participant no earlier than
twelve (12) months and one day after, and no later than twenty-four (24) months, after the Adoption Date. Any interest earned on the participant’s
cash account along with dividends (if any) earned on share units, will continue to accrue in share units on each participant’s account
until final payment is made. On November 3, 2022, the Board determined that the Deferred Fee Plan Termination Payment shall be made to
the participants in the Deferred Fee Plan on January 20, 2023.
As of October 31, 2022, the total payment related
to each participant’s cash account was approximately $ 2,317,000
(consisting of approximately $ 1,366,000
of cumulative fees and
approximately $ 951,000
of accrued interest) which had been deferred as of November 1, 2014 and was included in the “Deferred director
compensation payable” in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2022. On January 20, 2023, in accordance with
the Deferred Fee Plan Termination Payment, this amount was paid in full to each respective participant with no remaining balance due
as of January 31, 2023. Additionally, payment related to each participant’s share unit account in the form of the issuance of stock
was made to each respective participant resulting in the issuance of
274,509
shares of common stock from the
274,509
vested share units.
As of January 31, 2023, there were no remaining vested share units to be paid in the form of the issuance of stock.

Note 15 – Rental Income:
Commercial tenants :
Fixed lease income under our commercial operating
leases generally includes fixed minimum lease consideration, which is accrued on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. Variable
lease income includes consideration based on sales, as well as reimbursements for real estate taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain
other operating expenses of the properties.
Minimum fixed lease consideration (in thousands
of dollars) under non-cancelable tenant operating leases for each of the next
five years
and thereafter, excluding variable lease consideration
and rents from tenants for which collectability is deemed to be constrained, for the years ending October 31, as of January 31, 2023,
is as follows:

The above amounts assume that all leases which
expire are not renewed and, accordingly, neither month-to-month nor rentals from replacement tenants are included.
Minimum future rentals do not include contingent
rentals, which may be received under certain leases on the basis of percentage of reported tenants' sales volume. Rental income that is
contingent on future events is not included in income until the contingency is resolved. Contingent rentals included in income for the
three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material.
Residential tenants :
Lease terms for residential tenants are usually

Note 16 – Subsequent Events:
Effective February 1, 2023, FREIT entered into
a loan extension and modification agreement with Valley National Bank on its loan secured by the Westwood Plaza shopping center in Westwood,
New Jersey with a then outstanding balance of approximately $ 16,864,361 . Under the terms and conditions of this loan extension and modification,
the maturity date of the loan will be extended for a term of one (1) year from February 1, 2023 to February 1, 2024 with the option of
FREIT to extend for one additional year from the maturity date, subject to certain provisions of the loan agreement. The loan will be
payable based on monthly installments of approximately $ 157,347
based on a fixed rate of interest of
7.5 %. Additionally, FREIT funded
an interest reserve escrow account (“Escrow”) at closing representing the annualized principal and interest payments for one
(1) year, amounting to approximately $ 1,888,166 . This Escrow is held at Valley National Bank and in the event of a default on this loan,
the bank shall be permitted to use the proceeds from the escrow account to make monthly debt service payments on the loan.
On March 9, 2023, in accordance with FREIT’s Equity Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee of the FREIT Board of Directors (the “Board”) recommended to the Board and the Board approved that for services rendered and to be rendered in 2023, in lieu of cash compensation in the amount of $ 20,000 , each director was awarded shares of Common Stock, $ 0.01
par value, (the “Shares”) in FREIT. Based on the closing price of FREIT’s Shares on March 9, 2023 of $ 15.50
per Share, the Board has approved an award of
1,290
Shares of FREIT to each director serving on FREIT’s Board. Additionally, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board and the Board approved other adjustments to the compensation to be paid to directors and the executive officers of FREIT.

Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Cautionary Statement Identifying Important Factors
That Could Cause First Real Estate Investment Trust of New Jersey, Inc.’s (“FREIT”) Actual Results to Differ From Those
Projected in Forward Looking Statements.
Readers of this discussion are advised that the discussion
should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of FREIT (including related notes thereto)
appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, and the consolidated financial statements included in FREIT’s most recently filed Form 10-K.
Certain statements in this discussion may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements reflect FREIT’s current expectations and are based on estimates, projections,
beliefs, data, methods and assumptions of management of FREIT at the time of such statements regarding future results of operations, economic
performance, financial condition and achievements of FREIT, and do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These forward-looking
statements are identified through the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,”
“plan,” “estimate,” or words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties in
predicting future results and conditions.
Although FREIT believes that the expectations
reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.
These and certain other uncertainties, factors and risks, including those risk factors set forth and further described in Part I, Item
1A entitled “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, and other risks described
in our subsequent filings with the SEC, may cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected. Such factors include,
but are not limited to, the following: general economic and business conditions, including the purchase of retail products over the Internet,
which will, among other things, affect demand for rental space, the availability of prospective tenants, lease rents, the financial condition
of tenants and the default rate on leases, operating and administrative expenses and the availability of financing; adverse changes in
FREIT’s real estate markets, including, among other things, competition with other real estate owners, competition confronted by
tenants at FREIT’s commercial properties; governmental actions and initiatives; environmental/safety requirements; risks of real
estate development and acquisitions; and public health crises, epidemics and pandemics. The risks with respect to the development of real
estate include: increased construction costs, inability to obtain construction financing, or unfavorable terms of financing that may be
available, unforeseen construction delays and the failure to complete construction within budget.
OVERVIEW
FREIT is an equity real estate investment trust
(“REIT”) that is self-administered and externally managed. FREIT owns a portfolio of residential apartment and commercial
properties. FREIT’s revenues consist primarily of rental income and other related revenues from its residential and commercial properties
and additional rents derived from operating commercial properties. FREIT’s properties are primarily located in northern New Jersey
and New York.
The economic and financial environment :
As of January 2023, the annual inflation rate is at 6.4%, which is primarily being driven by soaring food prices and energy costs, labor
shortages and supply disruptions, while the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 3.4%. Though inflation still remains at a high level,
it is showing signs of slowing down as the inflation rate has come down from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. The Federal Reserve
continues to raise interest rates in an effort to lower inflation. However, the pace at which it may continue to do so is uncertain leading
to uncertainties in the financing market and a volatile economy.
Residential Properties:
Our residential
properties continue to generate positive cash flow while average rents on turned units (apartments which were vacated and then re-leased
to new tenants) has continued to increase across the portfolio. Additionally, the rate of increase on renewals for existing tenants has
continued to be robust, but could begin to soften in the current year. These increases should meaningfully contribute to FREIT’s
income over time but it is uncertain what impact the significant rise in inflation and rising interest rates may have on these properties
over the next year.
Commercial Properties:
While our
retail properties have stabilized from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our properties still have not attained pre-pandemic
operating levels despite some recovery in brick and mortar retail. Additionally, the significant rise in inflation and rising interest
rates could have an impact on the operating and financial performance of our commercial properties.
Debt Financing Availability:
Financing
has been available to FREIT and its affiliates. Certain recent refinancings and loan modifications/extensions have been at higher interest
rates and for shorter terms.
Effective February 1, 2023, FREIT entered into
a loan extension and modification agreement with Valley National Bank on its loan secured by the Westwood Plaza shopping center in Westwood,
New Jersey with a then outstanding balance of approximately $16,864,361. Under the terms and conditions of this loan extension and modification,
the maturity date of the loan will be extended for a term of one (1) year from February 1, 2023 to February 1, 2024 with the option of
FREIT to extend for one additional year from the maturity date, subject to certain provisions of the loan agreement. The loan will be
payable based on monthly installments
Index   Page
19
of approximately $157,347 based on a fixed rate of interest of 7.5%. Additionally, FREIT funded
an interest reserve escrow account (“Escrow”) at closing representing the annualized principal and interest payments for one
(1) year, amounting to approximately $1,888,166. This Escrow is held at Valley National Bank and in the event of a default on this loan,
the bank shall be permitted to use the proceeds from the escrow account to make monthly debt service payments on the loan.
On August 19, 2022, Westwood Hills, LLC exercised
its right, pursuant to the loan agreement, to extend the term of its $25 million loan on its property located in Westwood, New Jersey,
for an additional six (6) months from an initial maturity date of October 1, 2022 to a new maturity date of April 1, 2023. On March 1,
2023, Westwood Hills, LLC exercised its right, pursuant to the loan agreement, to extend the term of its loan, for an additional six (6)
months to a new maturity date of October 1, 2023 on the same terms and conditions as stated in the loan agreement. As of January 31, 2023,
$25,000,000 of this loan was drawn and outstanding and the interest rate was 8.37%.
Operating
Cash Flow:
FREIT expects that cash provided by operating activities and cash reserves will be adequate to cover mandatory debt
service payments (including payments of interest, but excluding balloon payments, which are expected to be refinanced and/or extended),
real estate taxes, recurring capital improvements at its properties and other needs to maintain its status as a REIT for at least a period
of one year from the date of filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Pursuant to the SEC disclosure guidance for
"Critical Accounting Policies," the SEC defines Critical Accounting Policies as those that require the application of management's
most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
Our discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, the preparation of which takes into account
estimates based on judgments and assumptions that affect certain amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from
these estimates. The accounting policies and estimates used, which are outlined in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, have been applied consistently as of January 31, 2023, and
for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. We believe that the following accounting policies or estimates require the application
of management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
Revenue Recognition: Base rents, additional
rents based on tenants' sales volume and reimbursement of the tenants' share of certain operating expenses are generally recognized when
due from tenants. The straight-line basis is used to recognize base rents under leases if they provide for varying rents over the lease
terms. Straight-line rents receivable represent unbilled rents receivable to the extent straight-line rents exceed current rents billed
in accordance with lease agreements. Before FREIT can recognize revenue, it is required to assess, among other things, its collectability.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets: FREIT assesses
the carrying value of long-lived assets periodically, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts
of certain assets may not be recoverable. When FREIT determines that the carrying value of long-lived assets may be impaired, the measurement
of any impairment is based on a projected discounted cash flow method determined by FREIT's management. While FREIT believes that our
discounted cash flow methods are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows may significantly affect the measurement
of impairment.
Real Estate Development Costs: It is FREIT’s
policy to capitalize pre-development costs, which generally include legal and professional fees and other directly related third-party
costs. Real estate taxes and interest costs incurred during the development and construction phases are also capitalized. FREIT ceases
capitalization of these costs when the project or portion thereof becomes operational, or when construction has been postponed. In the
event of postponement, capitalization of these costs will recommence once construction on the project resumes.
See Note 2 to FREIT’s condensed consolidated
financial statements for recently issued accounting standards.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Real estate revenue for the three months ended
January 31, 2023 (“Current Quarter”) decreased 34.5% to $6,979,000 compared to $10,649,000 for the three months ended January
31, 2022 (“Prior Year’s Quarter”). The decrease in revenue for the Current Quarter was primarily attributable to the
Maryland Properties sold in the Prior Year’s Quarter.
Net income attributable to common equity (“net
income-common equity”) for the Current Quarter was $419,000 ($0.06 per share basic and diluted) compared to $45,777,000 ($6.51 per
share basic and $6.45 per share diluted) for the Prior Year’s Quarter.
The schedule below provides a detailed analysis

The condensed consolidated results of operations
for the Current Quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other period. The table
above includes income from real estate operations, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not a measure of operating results or
cash flow as measured by GAAP, and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.
Adjusted net income (loss) for the Current Quarter
was adjusted net income of $289,000 ($0.04 per share basic and diluted) compared to adjusted net loss of ($850,000) (($0.12) per share
basic and diluted) for the Prior Year’s Quarter. Adjusted net income (loss) is a non-GAAP measure, which management believes is
a useful and meaningful gauge to investors of our operating performance, since it excludes the impact of unusual and infrequent items
specifically: a (loss) gain on sale of Maryland Properties.
The increase in adjusted net income for the
Current Quarter was primarily driven by the following: (a) a decrease in General & Administrative expenses (“G&A”)
of approximately $500,000 primarily driven by a decline in legal costs attributed to the legal proceeding between FREIT and certain of
its affiliates and Sinatra Properties, LLC of approximately $411,000 and a decrease in
Index   Page
21
legal costs incurred in the Prior Year’s
Quarter of approximately $77,000 related to the sale of the Maryland Properties; (b) an increase in adjusted net income of approximately
$444,000 (with a consolidated impact to FREIT of approximately $257,000) attributed to the Maryland Properties sold; (c) an increase in
investment income of approximately $163,000 resulting from higher interest rates in the Current Quarter; (d) a decrease in snow removal
costs at the commercial properties, excluding the Maryland Properties sold in the Prior Year’s Quarter, of approximately $93,000
(with a consolidated impact to FREIT of approximately $46,000) due to a milder winter compared to the Prior Year’s Quarter; (e)
a decrease in depreciation, excluding the Maryland Properties sold in the Prior Year’s Quarter, of approximately $72,000 (with a
consolidated impact to FREIT of approximately $24,000) primarily attributed to the write-off of a tenant improvement at the Wayne Preakness
Shopping Center in the Prior Year’s Quarter; and (f) a decrease in loss on investment in tenancy-in-common of approximately $57,000;
offset by (g) an increase in interest expense of approximately $193,000 (with a consolidated impact to FREIT of approximately $77,000)
attributed to the increase in the variable interest rate on the Westwood Hills loan as compared to the Prior Year’s Quarter. (Refer
to the segment disclosure below for a more detailed discussion of the financial performance of FREIT’s commercial and residential
segments.)

Average occupancy rate excludes the Rotunda Property, the Damascus Property and the Westridge Square Property from all periods presented as the properties were sold in the three months ended January 31, 2022. See Note 7 to FREIT’s condensed consolidated financial statements for further details.
NOI is based on operating revenue and expenses
directly associated with the operations of the real estate properties, but excludes deferred rents (straight lining), depreciation, financing
costs and other items. FREIT assesses and measures segment operating results based on NOI.
Same Property NOI: FREIT considers same property
net operating income (“Same Property NOI”) to be a useful supplemental non-GAAP measure of its operating performance. FREIT
defines same property within both the commercial and residential segments to be those properties that FREIT has owned and operated for
both the current and prior periods presented, excluding those properties that FREIT acquired, sold or redeveloped during those periods.
Any newly acquired property that has been in operation for less than a year, any property that is undergoing a major redevelopment but
may still be in operation at less than full capacity, and/or any property that has been sold is not considered same property.
NOI and Same Property NOI are non-GAAP financial
measures and are not measures of operating results or cash flow as measured by GAAP, and are not necessarily indicative of cash available
to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.
COMMERCIAL SEGMENT
The commercial segment contains five (5) separate
properties, excluding the Rotunda Property, the Westridge Square Property and the Damascus Property, which were sold on December 30, 2021,
January 7, 2022 and January 10, 2022, respectively. Four of these properties
Index   Page
22
are multi-tenanted retail centers and one is single tenanted
on land located in Rockaway, New Jersey owned by FREIT from which it receives monthly rental income from a tenant who has built and operates
a bank branch on the land. (See Note 7 to FREIT’s condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details on the sale
of the Maryland Properties.)
As indicated in the table above under the caption
Segment Information, total revenue and NOI from FREIT’s commercial segment for the Current Quarter decreased by 47.8% and 38.4%,
respectively, as compared to the Prior Year’s Quarter. Average occupancy for all commercial properties, excluding the Maryland Properties
sold, for the Current Quarter decreased by 2.5% as compared to the Prior Year’s Quarter.
The decline in revenue for the Current Quarter
was primarily attributable to the Maryland Properties sold in the Prior Year’s Quarter. The decrease in NOI for the Current Quarter
was primarily attributable to the following: (a) a decrease of approximately $778,000 attributed to the Maryland Properties sold in the
Prior Year’s Quarter; offset by (b) a decline in snow removal costs of approximately $93,000, excluding the Maryland Properties
sold, due to a milder winter compared to the Prior Year’s Quarter.
Same Property Operating Results: FREIT’s
commercial segment currently contains five (5) same properties. (See definition of same property under Segment Information above.) The
Rotunda Property, the Westridge Square Property and the Damascus Property were excluded from same property results for all periods presented
because these properties were sold in the Prior Year’s Quarter. Same property revenue and NOI for the Current Quarter increased
by 2.8% and 16.5%, respectively, as compared to the Prior Year’s Quarter. The changes resulted from the factors discussed in the
immediately preceding paragraph.
Leasing: The following table reflects leasing
activity at FREIT’s commercial properties for comparable leases (leases executed for spaces in which there was a tenant at some
point during the previous twelve-month period) and non-comparable leases for the Current Quarter:

RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT
FREIT currently operates six (6) multi-family
apartment buildings or complexes totaling 792 apartment units, excluding the Icon at the Rotunda Property, which was sold as part of the
Maryland Properties on December 30, 2021 (see Note 7 to FREIT’s condensed consolidated financial statements) and the Pierre Towers
property, which was converted to a TIC (see Note 5 to FREIT’s condensed consolidated financial statements).
As indicated in the table above under the caption
Segment Information, total revenue and NOI from FREIT’s residential segment for the Current Quarter decreased by 25% and 29.3%,
respectively, as compared to the Prior Year’s Quarter. Average occupancy for all residential properties, excluding the Icon at the
Rotunda property sold, for the Current Quarter decreased by 2.1% as compared to the Prior Year’s Quarter. The decrease in revenue
and NOI for the Current Quarter was primarily attributable to the Icon at the Rotunda Property sold in the Prior Year’s Quarter.
Same Property Operating Results: FREIT’s
residential segment currently contains six (6) same properties. (See definition of same property under Segment Information above.) The
Icon at the Rotunda Property was excluded from same property results for all periods presented because this property was sold in the Prior
Year’s Quarter. Same property revenue and NOI for the Current Quarter increased by 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively, as compared to the
Prior Year’s Quarter. The changes resulted from the factors discussed in the immediately preceding paragraph.
FREIT’s residential revenue is principally
composed of monthly apartment rental income. Total rental income is a factor of occupancy and monthly apartment rents. Monthly average
residential rents at the end of the Current Quarter and the Prior Year’s Quarter were $2,080 and $1,958, respectively. A 1% decline
in annual average occupancy, or a 1% decline in average rents from current levels, results in an annual revenue decline of approximately
$198,000 and $191,000, respectively.
Capital expenditures: FREIT tends to spend more
in any given year on maintenance and capital improvements at its residential properties which were constructed more than 25 years ago
(Steuben Arms, Berdan Court and Westwood Hills properties) than on its newer properties (Boulders, Regency and Station Place properties).
Funds for these capital projects are available from cash flow from the property's operations and cash reserves.

(a) Includes the effect of interest rate swap contracts which effectively convert the floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate over the term of the loan.
Total financing
costs for the Current Quarter decreased by approximately $1,052,000, or 35.9%, compared to the Prior Year’s Quarter which was primarily
attributable to the following: (a) a decline of approximately $1,304,000 attributed to the pay-down of the loans outstanding on the Maryland
Properties sold in the Prior Year’s Quarter; offset by (b) an increase of approximately $193,000 primarily attributed to the increase
in the variable interest rate on the Westwood Hills loan as compared to the Prior Year’s Quarter. (See Note 7 to FREIT’s condensed
consolidated financial statements for additional details on the sale of the Maryland properties.)
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
G&A for
the Current Quarter was approximately $827,000 compared to $1,327,000 for the Prior Year’s Quarter. The primary components of G&A
are legal and professional fees, directors’ fees, corporate expenses and accounting/auditing fees. The decrease in G&A for the
Current Quarter was primarily driven by a decline in legal costs attributed to the legal proceeding between FREIT and certain of its affiliates
and Sinatra Properties, LLC.
DEPRECIATION
Depreciation
expense for the Current Quarter was approximately $722,000 compared to $1,820,000 for the Prior Year’s Quarter. The decline in depreciation
expense for the Current Quarter was primarily attributable the following: (a) a decline of approximately $1,026,000 attributed to the
Maryland Properties sold in the Prior Year’s Quarter; and (b) a decrease of approximately $72,000, excluding the Maryland Properties
sold in the Prior Year’s Quarter, primarily attributed to the write-off of a tenant improvement at the Wayne Preakness Shopping
Center in the Prior Year’s Quarter. (See Note 7 to FREIT’s condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details
on the sale of the Maryland Properties.)
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Net cash used
in operating activities was approximately $0.9 million for the Current Quarter compared to net cash provided by operating activities of
approximately $2.9 million for the Prior Year’s Quarter. FREIT expects that cash provided by operating activities and cash reserves
will be adequate to cover mandatory debt service payments (including payments of interest, but excluding balloon payments, which are expected
to be refinanced and/or extended), real estate taxes, dividends, recurring capital improvements at its properties and other needs to maintain
its status as a REIT for at least a period of one year from the date of filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
As of January
31, 2023, FREIT had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $45.6 million, compared to $58.5 million at October 31, 2022.
The decrease in cash in the Current Quarter was primarily attributable to $11.8 million in net cash used in financing activities, $0.9
million in net cash used in operating activities and $0.4 million in net cash used in investing activities including capital expenditures.
The decrease in cash of approximately $13 million in the Current Quarter was primarily attributed to the following: (a) dividends paid
of approximately $10.7 million; (b) deferred compensation paid to respective directors of approximately $2.3 million; (c) a distribution
of additional net proceeds received from the sale of the Rotunda Property to the minority interest of approximately $1.6 million; and
(d) a distribution of additional net proceeds received from the sale of the Damascus Property to the minority interest of approximately
$0.3 million; offset by (e) proceeds received from the exercise of stock

options in November 2022 of approximately $1.2 million. (See
Note 7 to FREIT’s condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details on the sale of the Maryland properties.)
Credit Line: FREIT’s revolving line of
credit provided by Provident Bank was renewed for a three-year term ending on October 31, 2023. Draws against the credit line can be used
for working capital needs and standby letters of credit. Draws against the credit line are secured by mortgages on FREIT’s Franklin
Crossing Shopping Center in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey and retail space in Glen Rock, New Jersey. The total line of credit is $13 million
and the interest rate on the amount outstanding is based on a floating interest rate of prime minus 25 basis points with a floor of 3.75%.
As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, there was no amount outstanding and $13 million was available under the line of credit.
Dividend: After careful consideration of FREIT’s
projected operating results and cash needs, the FREIT Board of Directors (“Board”) declared a dividend of approximately $372,000
($0.05 per share) in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 which was paid on March 15, 2023 to stockholders of record on March 1, 2023. The
Board will continue to evaluate the dividend on a quarterly basis.
As of January 31, 2023, FREIT’s aggregate
outstanding mortgage debt was $138.9 million, which bears a weighted average interest rate of 5.22% and an average life of approximately
2.4 years. FREIT’s mortgages are subject to amortization schedules that are longer than the terms of the mortgages. As such, balloon
payments (unpaid principal amounts at the mortgage due date) for all mortgage debt will be required as follows:

Includes the following:

A loan on the Westwood Hills property, which is a residential property located in Westwood, New Jersey, in the amount of approximately $25 million.  Pursuant to the loan agreement, this loan was extended for an additional six (6) months from an initial maturity date of October 1, 2022 to a new maturity date of April 1, 2023.  On March 1, 2023, Westwood Hills, LLC exercised its right, pursuant to the loan agreement, to extend the term of its loan, for an additional six (6) months to a new maturity date of October 1, 2023 on the same terms and conditions as stated in the loan agreement.  (See Note 9 to FREIT's condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details.)
(B)
Effective February 1, 2023, FREIT entered into a loan extension and modification agreement with Valley National Bank on its loan secured by the Westwood Plaza shopping center in Westwood, New Jersey with a then outstanding balance of approximately $16,864,361. Under the terms and conditions of this loan extension and modification, the loan will be extended for a term of one (1) year from February 1, 2023 to February 1, 2024 with the option of FREIT to extend for one year from the maturity date, subject to certain provisions of the loan agreement.  (See Note 16 to FREIT's condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details.)
The following table shows the estimated fair
value and net carrying value of FREIT’s long-term debt at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022:
($ in Millions)

October 31, 2022
Fair Value
$133.8
$132.2
Carrying Value, Net

Fair values are estimated based on market interest
rates at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 and on a discounted cash flow analysis. Changes in assumptions or estimation methods may
significantly affect these fair value estimates. The fair value is based on observable inputs (level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as
provided by authoritative guidance).
FREIT expects to refinance the individual mortgages
with new mortgages or exercise extension options when their terms expire. To this extent, FREIT has exposure to interest rate risk. If
interest rates, at the time any individual mortgage note is due, are higher than the current fixed interest rate, higher debt service
may be required, and/or refinancing proceeds may be less than the amount of
Index   Page
25
mortgage debt being retired. For example, at January 31, 2023,
a 1% interest rate increase would reduce the fair value of FREIT’s debt by $2.8 million, and a 1% decrease would increase the fair
value by $3 million.
FREIT continually reviews its debt levels to
determine if additional debt can prudently be utilized for property acquisitions for its real estate portfolio that will increase income
and cash flow to stockholders.
Effective February 1, 2023, FREIT entered into
a loan extension and modification agreement with Valley National Bank on its loan secured by the Westwood Plaza shopping center in Westwood,
New Jersey with a then outstanding balance of approximately $16,864,361. Under the terms and conditions of this loan extension and modification,
the maturity date of the loan will be extended for a term of one (1) year from February 1, 2023 to February 1, 2024 with the option of
FREIT to extend for one additional year from the maturity date, subject to certain provisions of the loan agreement. The loan will be
payable based on monthly installments of approximately $157,347 based on a fixed rate of interest of 7.5%. Additionally, FREIT funded
an interest reserve escrow account (“Escrow”) at closing representing the annualized principal and interest payments for one
(1) year, amounting to approximately $1,888,166. This Escrow is held at Valley National Bank and in the event of a default on this loan,
the bank shall be permitted to use the proceeds from the escrow account to make monthly debt service payments on the loan.
On August 19, 2022, Westwood Hills, LLC exercised
its right, pursuant to the loan agreement, to extend the term of its $25 million loan on its property located in Westwood, New Jersey,
for an additional six (6) months from an initial maturity date of October 1, 2022 to a new maturity date of April 1, 2023. On March 1,
2023, Westwood Hills, LLC exercised its right, pursuant to the loan agreement, to extend the term of its loan, for an additional six (6)
months to a new maturity date of October 1, 2023 on the same terms and conditions as stated in the loan agreement. As of January 31, 2023,
$25,000,000 of this loan was drawn and outstanding and the interest rate was 8.37%.
Interest rate swap contracts: To reduce interest
rate volatility, FREIT uses a “pay fixed, receive floating” interest rate swap to convert floating interest rates to fixed
interest rates over the term of a certain loan. FREIT enters into these swap contracts with a counterparty that is usually a high-quality
commercial bank. In essence, FREIT agrees to pay its counterparties a fixed rate of interest on a dollar amount of notional principal
(which generally corresponds to FREIT’s mortgage debt) over a term equal to the term of the mortgage notes. FREIT’s counterparties,
in return, agree to pay FREIT a short-term rate of interest - generally LIBOR - on that same notional amount over the same term as the
mortgage notes.
FREIT had variable interest rate loans secured
by its Damascus Centre and Wayne PSC properties and currently has a variable interest rate loan secured by its Regency and Station Place
properties. To reduce interest rate fluctuations, FREIT entered into interest rate swap contracts for each of these loans. These interest
rate swap contracts effectively converted variable interest rate payments to fixed interest rate payments. The contracts were based on
a notional amount of approximately $16,200,000 ($14,504,000 at January 31, 2023) for the Regency swap and a notional amount of approximately
$12,350,000 ($11,695,000 at January 31, 2023) for the Station Place swap. On January 10, 2022, the property owned by Damascus Centre was
sold and a portion of the proceeds from the sale was used to pay off the $18.2 million then outstanding balance of the underlying loan
and the corresponding swap breakage fees of approximately $213,000 related to the early termination of the interest rate swap contracts
on this loan which was included as interest expense on the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income for the three months
ended January 31, 2022. (See Note 7 to FREIT’s condensed consolidated financial statements for further details on the sale of this
property.) On June 17, 2022, Wayne PSC terminated its interest rate swap contract on its underlying loan held with People’s United
Bank, which had a maturity date of October 2026, for a settlement amount of approximately $1.4 million. People’s United Bank held
the proceeds from this settlement in escrow until the underlying loan was paid off in July 2022. (See Note 9 to FREIT’s condensed
consolidated financial statements for further details.)
Interest rate cap contract: To limit exposure
on interest rate volatility, FREIT may use an interest rate cap contract to cap a floating interest rate at a set pre-determined rate.
FREIT enters into cap contracts with a counterparty that is usually a high-quality commercial bank. In essence, so long as the floating
interest rate is below the cap rate, FREIT agrees to pay its counterparties a variable rate of interest on a dollar amount of notional
principal (which generally corresponds to FREIT’s mortgage debt). Once the floating interest rate rises above the cap rate, FREIT’s
counterparties, in return, agree to pay FREIT a short-term rate of interest above the cap on that same notional amount.
In accordance with ASU 2017-12,
“Targeted
Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC 815")” ,
FREIT marks-to-market its interest rate swap and cap contracts. As the floating interest rate varies from time-to-time over the term of
the contract, the value of the contract will change upward or downward. If the floating rate is higher than the fixed rate, the value
of the contract goes up and there is a gain and an asset. If the floating rate is less than the fixed rate, there is a loss and a liability.
The interest rate swaps and cap are accounted for as cash flow hedges with the corresponding gains or losses on these contracts not affecting
FREIT’s condensed consolidated statement of income; changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges will be reported in other
comprehensive income and appear in the equity section of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. This gain or loss represents the economic
consequence of liquidating fixed rate swaps or the cap contract and replacing them with like-duration funding at current market rates,
something we would likely never do. Periodic cash settlements of these contracts will be accounted for as an adjustment to interest expense.
FREIT has the following derivative-related risks
with its interest rate swap contracts (“contract”): 1) early termination risk, and 2) counterparty credit risk.
Index   Page
26
Early Termination Risk : If FREIT
wants to terminate its contract before maturity, it would be bought out or terminated at market value; i.e., the difference in the present
value of the anticipated net cash flows from each of the contract’s parties. If current variable interest rates are significantly
below FREIT’s fixed interest rate payments, this could be costly. Conversely, if interest rates rise above FREIT’s fixed interest
payments and FREIT elected early termination, FREIT would realize a gain on termination. At January 31, 2023, the contracts for Regency
and Station Place were in FREIT’s favor. If FREIT had terminated these contracts at that date, it would have realized a gain of
approximately $482,000 for the Regency swap and $477,000 for the Station Place swap all of which have been included in FREIT’s condensed
consolidated balance sheet as at January 31, 2023. The change in the fair value for the contract (gain or loss) during such period has
been included in comprehensive (loss) income and for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, FREIT recorded an unrealized loss
of approximately $450,000 and unrealized gain of $1,262,000, respectively, in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss)
income.
Counterparty Credit Risk : Each
party to a contract bears the risk that its counterparty will default on its obligation to make a periodic payment. FREIT reduces this
risk by entering into a contract only with major financial institutions that are experienced market makers in the derivatives market.

ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS
Funds From Operations (“FFO”) is
a non-GAAP measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). FREIT does not include
distributions from equity/debt/capital gain sources in its computation of FFO. Although many consider FFO as the standard measurement
of a REIT’s performance, FREIT modified the NAREIT computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income that are not
considered by management to be the primary drivers of its decision making process. These adjustments to GAAP net income are straight-line
rents and recurring capital improvements on FREIT’s residential apartments. The modified FFO computation is referred to as Adjusted
Funds From Operations (“AFFO”). FREIT believes that AFFO is a superior measure of its operating performance. FREIT computes
FFO and AFFO as follows:

FFO and AFFO do not represent cash generated
from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should not be considered a substitute for net income as a measure of
results of operations or for cash flow from operations as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, the application and calculation of FFO
and AFFO by certain other REITs may vary materially from that of FREIT, and therefore FREIT’s FFO and AFFO may not be directly comparable
to those of other REITs.
INFLATION
Inflation can impact the financial performance
of FREIT in various ways. FREIT’s commercial tenant leases normally provide that the tenants bear all or a portion of most operating
expenses, which can reduce the impact of inflationary increases on FREIT. Apartment leases are normally for a one-year term, which may
allow FREIT to seek increased rents as leases renew or when new tenants are obtained, subject to prevailing market conditions.

About Market Risk
See “Commercial Segment”, “Residential
Segment” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” under Item 2 above for a detailed discussion of FREIT’s quantitative
and qualitative market risk disclosures.
Item 4: Controls and Procedures
At the end of the period covered by this report,
we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of FREIT’s disclosure controls and procedures. This
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with participation of FREIT’s management, including FREIT’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who concluded that FREIT’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of January 31,
2023. There has been no change in FREIT’s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, FREIT’s internal control over financial reporting.
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls
and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in FREIT’s reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in FREIT’s reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including FREIT’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Part II: Other Information
Item 1: Legal Proceedings
On February
4, 2022, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Monmouth County (“Court”) entered an Order with respect to summary judgment motions
filed by the parties in connection with litigation between certain affiliates of FREIT (the “Sellers” or “Defendant”)
and Sinatra Properties, LLC (“Sinatra” or “Plaintiff”). The litigation relates to a Purchase and Sale Agreement
entered into on January 14, 2020 (“PSA”) between the Sellers and Sinatra involving the sale by the Sellers of 100% of their
ownership interests in six (6) real properties held by the Sellers.
The Court Order entered on February 4, 2022
(the “February 4 Order”) with respect to the Summary Judgment Motions provides as follows:
(1) The Court finds that the Plaintiff’s have breached the subject contract and the Court dismisses
all claims for relief filed by the Plaintiffs in this suit. The Court dismissed the Complaint and dismisses the Lis Pendens.
(2) The Court finds that the liquidated damage provision of the contract is not enforceable and the Court
Orders that the $15 million held in escrow be returned to the Plaintiff.
(3) The Court dismisses the Counterclaims and Third Party Complaint. All pleadings are dismissed.
On May 31, 2022, Sinatra filed a Motion for
Reconsideration with the Court, requesting that the Court reconsider its February 4, 2022 Order and, among other things, (a) grant Sinatra’s
motion for summary judgment, and (b) reverse the Court’s findings that (1) Sinatra breached the Purchase and Sale Agreement, (2)
the Sellers did not breach the Purchase and Sale Agreement and (3) the Court’s dismissal of the Complaint and Lis Pendens. On July
8, 2022, the Court denied Sinatra’s Motion for Reconsideration.
Following the February 4 Order, the Sellers
and the Purchaser each filed a motion for an award of attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Purchase
and Sale Agreement. On December 8, 2022 the Court entered an Order awarding Sellers $3,420,422.88 in attorneys’ fees and denying
the Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees (the “December 8 Order”). Upon entering the December 8 Order, the
Court had adjudicated all unresolved issues in the action.
On December 8, 2022, the Sellers filed a
Notice of Appeal, appealing from that portion of the February 4 Order which declined to enforce the liquidated damages provision in
the Purchase and Sale Agreement. As a result of such appeal by the Sellers, the liquidated damage amount of $15 million remains in
escrow and has not been returned to Sinatra.
On December 22, 2022, the Purchaser filed a
Notice of Cross Appeal appealing from all determinations by the Court adverse to the Purchaser, including (i) that portion of the February
4 Order holding that the Purchaser breached the contract; (ii) the denial of the Purchaser’s motion for reconsideration of the February
4 Order; and (iii) the December 8 Order awarding the Sellers $3,420,422.88 in attorneys’ fees and denying the Purchaser’s
request for attorneys’ fees.
The Sellers continue to believe that the allegations
set forth in the Complaint filed by Sinatra and in the Answer to Counterclaims and Third-Party Complaint and Affirmative Defenses filed
by Sinatra and Kushner Realty Acquisition LLC, are without merit.
