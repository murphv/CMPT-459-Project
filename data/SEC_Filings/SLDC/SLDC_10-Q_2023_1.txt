1.
Nature of Operations and Going Concern
Telco
Cuba, Inc. (fka CaerVision Global, Inc., fka American Mineral Group Minerals Inc.) (the "Company") was incorporated in the
State of Nevada on August 10, 2007. Up until June 12, 2015, the company was previously engaged in the exploration, development, and acquisition
of mineral properties.
On
June 12, 2015, the Company consummated a Share Exchange with Amgentech, Inc., a Florida corporation.   Under the terms of the Share
Exchange, the holders of Amgentech received 50,088 shares of Series B Preferred Stock that had been previously issued to third parties
in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding capital of Amgentech. Each share of Series B preferred is convertible into 5,000 shares
of common stock (254,440,000 shares total) and has voting rights of 5,000 per share (254,440,000 votes).
As a result of this transaction,
Amgentech became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company with control transferring to the previous owners of Amgentech.  Amgentech
elected to be treated as the successor issuer for SEC reporting and accounting purposes.  The Share Exchange was accounted for as
a reverse acquisition and re-capitalization. The Amgentech Shareholders obtained approximately 60% of voting control on the date of Share
Exchange. Amgentech was the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Company was the acquired company.
The Company filed an amendment to its articles of incorporation and changed its name to Telco Cuba, Inc. Telco Cuba is foremost
a technology solutions service provider offering services under the brand names “Amgentech” and “Telco Cuba”.
Going
Concern
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern; accordingly,
they do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore
be required to realize its assets and retire its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from
those in the accompanying financial statements. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit
of $ 4.962
million.
The Company currently does not have the cash resources to meet its operating
commitments for the next twelve months and expects to have ongoing requirements for capital investment or debt to implement its business
plan. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern for a reasonable
period of time.
Management plans to raise cash from public or private debt or equity financing, on an as needed basis. The Company's
ability to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt unless it can achieve profitable operations and/or upon obtaining additional
financing. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time.
2.
Basis of Presentation
We
prepared our interim consolidated condensed financial statements that accompany these notes in conformity with GAAP, consistent in all
material respects with those applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2016 (2016 Form 10-K).
We have made estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in our consolidated condensed financial statements and the accompanying
notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. The interim financial information is unaudited,
and reflects all normal adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods
presented. This report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements in our 2016 Form 10-K.

Significant Accounting Policies
a)    Accounting
Principles
The
accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to United States generally accepted accounting principles.
b)
Basic and Diluted Loss per Share
Basic
and diluted loss per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Fully diluted shares are calculated as follows:

c)    Fair
Value Measurements
Valuation
Hierarchy
ASC
820 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes
the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial
instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities
at fair value. A financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The
following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring and non-recurring basis as of February
28, 2017, and November 30, 2016:

$ 132,098

The derivative liabilities are measured at fair value using quoted market prices and estimated volatility factors based on historical
quoted market prices for the Company’s common stock and are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
8
Telco
Cuba, Inc.
Notes
to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
The fair value of the derivative liabilities was calculated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model under the assumptions detailed
in Note 8. Gains and losses (realized and unrealized) are included in earnings.
The
Company did not have any Level 1 or Level 2 assets or liabilities as of February 28, 2017, and November 30, 2016, and had Level
3 liabilities consisting of notes payable.  The carrying amount of the notes payable at February 28, 2017, and November 30, 2016,
approximate their respective fair value based on the Company’s incremental borrowing rate.
Cash
and cash equivalents include money market securities that are considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable. These securities
are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities and are therefore classified as Level 1 within our
fair value hierarchy.
In
addition, FASB ASC 825-10-25 Fair Value Option was effective at the time of adoption. ASC 825-10-25 expands opportunities to use fair
value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items
at fair value. The Company did not elect the fair value options for any of its qualifying financial instruments.
d)
Income Taxes
Income
taxes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation
allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
e)
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash includes demand deposits, saving accounts and money market accounts. The Company considers
all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
f)     Revenue
Recognition
The
Companies follow the guidance of the FASB ASC 605-10-S99 “Revenue Recognition Overall – SEC Materials”. The Companies
record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed
or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues consist primarily of product sales.
g)    Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those reported.

Notes

h)
Accounts receivable and concentration of credit risk
The
Company provides credit to its clients in the form of payment terms. The Company limits its credit risk by performing credit evaluations
of its clients and maintaining a reserve, if deemed necessary, for potential credit losses. Such evaluations include the review of a
customer’s outstanding balances with consideration towards such customer’s historical collection experience, as well as prevailing
economic and market conditions and other factors.  The
Company currently has no accounts receivable in 2016 and, therefore, does not currently have a concentrated credit risk associated with
trade receivables.
i)     Inventory
Inventory
is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with the cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The Company
reviews physical inventory for obsolescence and/or excess and will record a reserve if necessary. As of the date of this report, no reserve
was deemed necessary.
j)     Fixed
Assets
Fixed
assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, with depreciation recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term, if applicable. When assets are retired or disposed, the cost and accumulated depreciation
are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
in the period incurred.
Fixed
assets consist primarily of computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. The estimated useful lives range from three to five years.
The
Company’s property and equipment are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from the undiscounted future cash flows of such asset over the anticipated
holding period. An impairment loss is measured by the excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.
Impairment
analyses are based on management’s current plans, asset holding periods, and currently available market information. If these criteria
change, the Company’s evaluation of impairment losses may be different and could have a material impact to the consolidated financial
statements.
For
the years ended November 30, 2016, and 2015, based on the results of management’s impairment analyses, there were  no  impairment
losses.
k)     Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Management
does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements if currently adopted would have a material
effect on the accompanying financial statements.

c)
Preferred Stock
For
the quarter ended February 28, 2017:
The
Company has
400,000
shares of preferred stock authorized of which
300,000
shares were designated in three series as follows:
Series
A Senior Convertible Voting Non-Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred”) –
100,000
shares authorized,
55,555
shares issued and outstanding;
Series
B Senior Subordinated Convertible Voting Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred”) –
100,000
shares authorized,
82,544
shares issued and outstanding; and
Series
C Senior Subordinated Convertible Voting Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred”) –
200,000
shares authorized,
issued and outstanding;
Each
share of Series A Preferred is convertible into 1,000 restricted shares of common stock.
Each share of Series B Preferred is convertible
into 5,000 restricted shares of common stock.
Series C Preferred Stock is convertible into 100,000 votable shares, but not convertible
to common shares otherwise.
Conversion is at the discretion of the preferred shareholder, and no additional consideration is paid.
The Company Preferred
Stock has no dividend rights but does have liquidation rights as follows: The Series A Preferred is senior in liquidation preference
to all other series or classes of capital stock, preferred or common; the Series B Preferred is senior in liquidation preference to all
series or classes of capital stock other than the Series A Preferred; the Series C Preferred is senior in liquidation preference to all
classes of Common Stock.
d)
Warrants and Options
There
are
no
outstanding stock options and warrants.
5 .
Concentration Risk
The
Company's financial instruments consist of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. It is management's opinion that the Company
is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. Because of the short maturity and capacity
of prompt liquidation of such assets and liabilities, the fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying values.
Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its
cash with high credit quality financial institutions in the United States.  Bank deposits in the United States did not exceed
federally insured limits.
The
Company may operate outside the United States of America and thus may have significant exposure to foreign currency risk in the future
due to the fluctuations between the currency in which the Company operates and the U.S. dollar.

million which may be carried forward to apply
against future taxable income. These losses will expire in 2034. Deferred tax assets related to these losses have not been recorded due
to uncertainty regarding their utilization.
7.
Convertible Debentures
As
of February 28, 2017, and November 30, 2016, the Company has issued and outstanding, convertible debt totaling $ 540,344
and $ 621,843 ,
of which all but one note for $ 15,000
were held by unrelated third parties. As of February 28, 2017, these debts were all due on demand,
bear interest at the rates between
8 % and
12 % per annum and are convertible at a discount to the stock’s market price of between
15% and 55%, based on a look back period of between 10 and 30 days prior to conversion. Combined, these convertible instruments can be
converted into
499,204,917
and
473,782,517
shares of common stock as of February 28, 2017, and November 30, 2016, respectively.
8.   Derivative
Liabilities
In
June 2008, the FASB finalized ASC 815, “Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is indexed to an Entity’s
Own Stock.” Under ASC 815, instruments which do not have fixed settlement provisions are deemed to be derivative instruments. The
Company has determined that it needs to account for convertible debentures issued for its shares of common stock, as derivative liabilities,
and apply the provisions of ASC 815. The instruments have a ratchet provision that adjust either the exercise price and/or quantity of
the shares as the conversion price equals to variable % of the "market price" at the time of conversion, as a result, the instruments
need to be accounted for as derivative liabilities. In accordance with ASC 815, these convertible debentures have been re-characterized
as derivative liabilities. ASC 815, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“ASC 815”)
requires that the fair value of these liabilities be re-measured at the end of every reporting period with the change in fair value reported
in the statement of operations.
The
fair value of the derivative liabilities was measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
At
February 28, 2017, the fair value of the embedded derivatives was determined using Binomial Option Pricing Model based on the following
assumptions:

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The
following discussion and analysis provide information which management of the Company believes to be relevant to an assessment and understanding
of the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read together with the Company’s
financial statements and the notes to the financial statements, which are included in this report.
Forward-Looking
Statements
This
Report contains forward-looking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance. Some discussions in this
report may contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. A number of important factors could cause our actual
results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us in this Report. Forward-looking statements
are often identified by words like “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “intend,”
“project” and similar words or expressions that, by their nature, refer to future events.
In
some cases, you can also identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,”
“plans,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these terms or other
comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that
may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels
of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels
of activity, or achievements. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date
of this Report. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially from historical results or our predictions. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United
States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements in an effort to conform these statements to actual results.
Financial
Condition
As
of February 28, 2017, the Company had total current assets of $19,921 and total current liabilities of $5,490,782 for a net working capital
deficit of $5,470,861. As of February 29, 2016, the Company had total current assets of $26,864 and total current liabilities of $5,381,900
for a net working capital deficit of $5,355,036.
We
need to raise additional money to meet our general and administrative expenses, and we need to raise money to achieve our business objectives.
The additional funding will come from equity financing from the sale of Telco Cuba's common stock or the issuance of debt securities.
If we are successful in completing an equity financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in Telco Cuba.
The Company does not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that the Company will be able to
raise sufficient funding from the sale of its common stock or debt securities. In the absence of such financing, our business will fail.
Based
on the nature of Telco Cuba's business, management anticipates incurring operating losses in the foreseeable future. Management bases
this expectation, in part, on the fact that unrolling a telecommunications operation will cost a substantial amount of money, and possibly
take several years before becoming profitable. The Company’s future financial results are also uncertain due to a number of factors,
some of which are outside its control. These factors include, but are not limited to:
Telco
Cuba's ability to raise additional funding is based on;
Telco
Cuba's ability to capture market share; and
16
Due to the Company’s lack of operating
history and present inability to generate revenues, our independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph to their audit opinion
issued in connection with our financial statements for 2015, and 2016 indicating substantial doubt about Telco Cuba's ability to continue
as a going concern. This means that there is substantial doubt whether the Company can continue as an ongoing business for the next 12
months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills.
Liquidity
The
Company's internal sources of liquidity will be loans that may be available from management as well as revenue from its subsidiaries.
Although Telco Cuba has no written arrangements with its management, we expect that the officers may provide the Company with nominal
liquidity, when and if it is required.
The
Company’s external sources of liquidity will be private placements for equity and debt financing. There
are no assurances that Telco Cuba will be able to achieve further sales of its common stock or any other form of additional financing.
If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue its plan of operations, then the Company will not be able to continue
its operations and its business will fail.
Capital
Resources
The
Company’s current cash is not sufficient to fully finance its operations at current and planned levels for the next 12 months.
Management intends to manage the Company's expenses and payments to preserve cash until the Company is profitable, otherwise additional
financing must be arranged. Specifically, management is deferring payments due them until such time as there is sufficient financing
in place to permit their payment or the possible issuance of the Company’s stock in settlement of amounts due.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
. We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in Rule
13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management
recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures,
our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls
and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions.
The
Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, and as discussed in greater detail below, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective:
• to give
reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports that are file under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and forms, and
• to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are file or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and our Treasurer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
This
assessment is due in part to the Company’s inability to file its annual and quarterly reports on a timely basis. The Company has,
since the share exchange, engaged consultants specializing in financial statement preparation and SEC reporting to assist with preparing
and filing the required forms in a timely and accurate manner.  Continued compliance will, in part, depend on the Company having
sufficient capital to engage independent auditors to review and audit its financial statement filings.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
There
are no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

• 10,000,000
common shares in connection with the conversion of $94,000 of convertible debentures and accrued interest.
• 2.240,123

• 16,025,192
common shares in connection with the conversion of $8,172 of convertible debentures and accrued interest.
• 1,200,000
common shares issued on conversion of 240 Preferred B shares.
The
Company has not undertaken an offering in which it sold a high number of securities to a high number of investors. In addition, these
shareholders had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since they agreed to and received share certificates bearing
a legend stating that such securities are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act. This restriction ensures that these
securities would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a “public offering.” Based
on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for
this transaction.
