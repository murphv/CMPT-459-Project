ADAMAS ONE CORP.
NOTES
TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
For
the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
NOTE
1 –
ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS ACTIVITY
We
were incorporated on September 6, 2018, in the state of Nevada for the purpose of acquiring existing technology that would efficiently
and effectively produce lab-grown, environmentally friendly, ethically sourced diamonds. On January 31, 2019, we entered into an Amended
Asset Purchase Agreement with Scio Diamond Technology Corporation, or Scio, which was subsequently amended February 3, 2020, pursuant
to which we acquired substantially all of the assets of Scio, which assets consisted primarily of proprietary diamond growing chemical
reactors, which we refer to as diamond growing machines, patents, and all intellectual property related thereto, for an aggregate of
1,500,000
shares of our common stock and payment to certain lenders of Scio of an aggregate of $ 2.1
million
in cash. In addition, we
agreed to pay one-half of certain other unsecured operational liabilities of Scio. The transaction was approved by a majority of the
Scio stockholders voting in person or by proxy at a special meeting of stockholders held commencing on June 7, 2019 and reconvening on
August 6, 2019. The transaction closed on October 17, 2019. We recorded the net value of the assets purchased and liabilities assumed
at $ 8.65
million .
Since
acquiring the assets of Scio, we have continued to further develop the technologies acquired from Scio, and we have begun producing diamonds
for fine jewelry and diamond material for industrial uses.
NOTE
2 –
GOING CONCERN
The
accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We incurred a net loss of $9.0 million and used approximately $1.7
million of cash in operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Further information related to a going concern may be obtained
in NOTE 2 of the Company’s 2022 audited financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022, and in the Going Concern Uncertainty
paragraph in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, also contained in the above referenced financial statements.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the following year.
We
will need additional financing to implement our full business plan and to service our ongoing operations. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to secure any needed funding, or that if such funding is available, the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us.
If we are unable to obtain additional financing when it is needed, we will need to restructure our operations and possibly divest all
or a portion of our business. We may seek additional capital through a combination of equity offerings and debt financings. Debt
financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such
as incurring additional debt, and could increase our expenses and require that our assets secure such debt. Equity financing, if obtained,
could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and/or require such stockholders to waive certain rights and preferences. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and
classification of liabilities or any other adjustment that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles
of Presentation
The
condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared by us without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended
September 30, 2022. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted as permitted
by the SEC, although we believe the disclosures that are made are adequate to make the information presented herein not misleading.
The
accompanying condensed financial statements reflect, in our opinion, all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our
financial position at December 31, 2022 and the results of our operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
Interim
results are subject to seasonal variations, and the results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Significant estimates made in preparing the financial statements include, but are not limited to, the following: collectability
of accounts receivable, the potential impairment of goodwill, valuation of deferred tax assets, carrying value of inventories, useful
lives and recovery of equipment and other intangible assets, and valuation of stock-based compensation.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
For
purposes of the statements of cash flows, we consider highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or
less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Accounts
Receivable
We
follow the allowance method of recognizing uncollectible accounts receivable, which recognizes bad debt expense based on a review of
the individual accounts outstanding and our prior history of uncollectible accounts receivable. We extend credit based on an evaluation
of each customer’s financial condition, and our receivables are generally unsecured. Accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance
for doubtful accounts in the balance sheet. We consider accounts past due if outstanding longer than contractual payment terms. We record
an allowance based on consideration of a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts are past due, our previous loss
history, the creditworthiness of individual customers, economic conditions affecting specific customer industries, and economic conditions
in general. We charge-off accounts receivable after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted. We credit payments subsequently
received on such receivables to bad debt expense in the period we receive the payment.
As
of December 31, 2022, we had established an allowance of $ 355,850 , for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable. We record delinquent
finance charges on outstanding accounts receivable only if they are collected.
Property
and Equipment
We
recorded property and equipment purchased at cost. We compute depreciation, after equipment is placed in service, using the straight-line
method at rates intended to depreciate the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, which are generally four to ten years. Upon
retirement or sale of property and equipment, we will remove the cost of the disposed assets and related accumulated depreciation from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to selling, general, and administrative expenses. We charge expenditures
for normal repairs and maintenance to expense as incurred. We capitalize additions and expenditures for improving or rebuilding existing
assets that extend the useful life. Leasehold improvements made either at the inception of the lease or during the lease term will be
amortized over the shorter of their economic lives or the lease term including any renewals that are reasonably assured.
Goodwill
Goodwill
represents the excess of fair value over identifiable tangible and intangible net assets acquired in the Scio business combination. Goodwill
is not amortized, instead goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis between annual tests when events
or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than it’s carrying value.
The goodwill that arose from the Scio asset purchase agreement was independently valued at $ 5,413,000
as of August 7, 2019. We completed
our last annual goodwill impairment test in our fourth quarter for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, and as a result of the annual
test management determined that no change was needed to the carrying value of goodwill at September 30, 2022 or as of December 31, 2022.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
We
continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the
carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows
is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the
fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.
No impairment expense was recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Revenue
Recognition
We
generate revenue from the production and sale of diamonds. We recognize revenue according to Accounting Standards Codification 606 –
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). When the customer obtains control over the promised goods or services, we
record revenue in the amount of consideration that we can expect to receive in exchange for those goods. We apply the following five-step
model to determine revenue recognition:
●
identification
of a contract with a customer;
●
identification
of the performance obligations in the contact;
●
determination
of the transaction price;
●
allocation
of the transaction price to the separate performance obligations; and
●
recognition
of revenue when performance obligations are satisfied.
We
only apply the five-step model when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the
goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception and once the contract is determined to be within the scope of
ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and
assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. Our contracts contain a single performance obligation (delivery of diamonds), and
the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. We recognize as revenue the amount of the
transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it
is satisfied. Accordingly, we recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of our product, which typically occurs upon
delivery of the product. Our credit terms are currently that payment is due within 90 days.
Disaggregated
Revenue Information
We
have no disaggregated revenue to report for the three months ended December 31, 2022 or 2021.
We continue to have one wholesale customer.
Advertising
Costs
We
plan to expense advertising costs as they are incurred. We have incurred no advertising costs to date.
Inventories
We
state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine cost using the average cost method on all inventory
generated by our manufacturing operations upon our transition from research and development in our manufacturing facility to the
full production of our products for sale. At both December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022, our inventory consisted primarily of
finished and nearly finished precious stones in various carat sizes, shapes, and colors.
Stock-Based
Compensation
We
account for stock-based compensation at estimated fair value on the date of grant. There were
920,000
shares of common stock granted to three employees for one year’s services of each employee and fully expensed during the three
months ended December 31, 2022. These were valued at approximate $4 per share, or an aggregate of $ 3,680,000 .
In
addition, the Company issued 666,413 warrants upon the conversion of $4.1 million in debt. These warrants were valued at $2,038,000 using
Black-Scholes with the following significant terms. Term 5 year, volatility 80%, risk-free interest rate 3%, expected dividend yield
0%.
9
There
were no shares granted for employees nor expensed during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The
price per share was based upon sales of our common stock near the date of grant. The grants are fully vested and are recognized upon
the date of grant.
Concentrations
of Credit Risk
Accounts
at banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC, up to $250,000. As of December 31, 2022, our bank account
balance exceeded the federally insured limit. We mitigate this exposure by using a high credit financial institution. We have one wholesale customer, representing substantially all of our accounts receivable.
Income
Taxes
We
account for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740 - Income Taxes,
or ASC 740. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We measure deferred tax assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable amounts in years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. If it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation
allowance is recognized. We reflect changes in recognition or measurement in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We currently
have substantial net operating loss carryforwards. We have recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax assets due to
the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets.
Contingencies
Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will only be resolved when
one or more future events occur or fail to occur. We assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise
of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to potential unasserted claims that may result in legal proceedings against us,
we evaluate the perceived merits of any claims and the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein
and determine if any loss is likely.
If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
is reasonably estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in our financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially
material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the
contingent liability, together with an estimate of range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed. There were
no known loss contingencies identified as of December 31, 2022.
Loss
Per Common Share
We
calculate basic loss per share using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each reporting period.
Diluted loss per share includes potentially dilutive financial instruments, such as convertible term notes and related interest. We excluded
903,351
and
1,363,346
shares from the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. These shares are what would have been issued if the convertible debt, plus accrued
interest had converted for each of the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncement
Adopted
In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The update improves financial reporting about leasing transactions by
requiring a lessee to record on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by lease terms of
more than 12 months. We adopted ASU 2016-02 in the three months ended December 31, 2022. We completed the process of aggregating and
evaluating lease arrangements and implementing new processes during the three months ended December 31, 2022. As a result of evaluating
the impact of adoption of the ASU on our financial statements we recognized a right-of-use asset and lease liability on our balance sheet
for our real estate operating leases. At October 1, 2022 we recognized a right of use asset of $1.4 million, and a lease liability
of $1.4 million.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property
and equipment are listed net of the related accumulated depreciation as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. As of December
31, 2022, the Company has a deposit on equipment on order in the amount of $ 1.3
million , which represents approximately 50% of the total purchase price. As the equipment is not yet in service, it is not
being depreciated.
Depreciation
expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled $ 80,852
and $ 78,250
respectively.

COMMITMENTS
Indemnifications
During
the normal course of business, we make certain indemnities and commitments under which we may be required to make payments in relation
to certain transactions. These may include (i) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence
or willful misconduct; and (ii) indemnities involving the representations and warranties in certain contracts. In addition, under our
bylaws we are committed to our directors and officers for providing for payments upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events. The
majority of these indemnities and commitments do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential for future payments that we
could be obligated to make. We have not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements.
As a result, we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we had no liabilities recorded for these
agreements as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022.
Leases
We
are obligated under a triple-net operating lease for our 6,475 square foot manufacturing facility located in Greenville, South Carolina,
which is classified as an operating lease. The terms of the lease require a payment of approximately $10,000 per month, which includes
an estimate for utilities, taxes, and repairs. This lease expires in August 2023.
We
believe this facility will be adequate to meet our current needs based on the property and equipment currently owned. However, our business
plan will require additional space, and we will be making plans to expand our building footprint at possible new or additional locations
to accommodate additional manufacturing equipment. As part of the initial expansion discussed above, we have entered into a lease for
23,485 square feet of additional manufacturing space in Greenville, South Carolina, expiring in July 2036. In addition, we have a lease
for 3,414 square feet of office space in Scottsdale, Arizona, expiring in September 2024. The office is to facilitate the administration
and marketing of expanding the manufacturing aspect of our company as well as to administer increased management anticipated in areas
of human resources, finance, accounting, and financial analysis as well as sales and marketing to manage the growth in the production
output as a result of the second facility in Greenville, South Carolina. We intend to pay for these improvements using a combination
of working capital, new debt financing, and equity offerings.
The weighted average remaining lease term and
weighted average discount rate for operating leases were 11.9 years and 5.0%, respectively. The operating lease cost for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $78,000.
The
future minimum lease payment required under our leases as of December 31, 2022 are as follows:

Employment
Agreements
We
have entered into five separate employment agreements that provide for stock to be issued annually in varying amounts through fiscal
2025. The price per share to be included in employee stock compensation expense will be based upon the fair market value of the stock
on the date of grant. The grants are fully vested, pending the service requirement of continued employment.
We
also have salary commitments contained in our various employment agreements through fiscal year 2025.
After
2025, one salary continues to increase at 9% per year from its approximately $280,000 2025 base salary.
11
Additional
Compensation
In
addition to the above stock commitments, we have agreed to provide certain executive officers with compensation paid in diamonds. These
commitments amount to issuing 9.5 carats of diamonds per month through September 2024 and 2.5 carats of diamonds per month through October
2025. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 this obligation has been accrued at a valuation of $1,000 per carat, which
is based on management’s estimate of the market value of the diamonds.
Litigation
During December 2022, we became a party to a class
action filing previously between Scio and a class action investor. We have retained outside counsel specifically for this matter and
are working with other defendants named in this matter to increase our chance of prevailing. On February 17, 2022 the Company filed a
motion to dismiss the class action in concert with Scio which filed a separate motion to dismiss this class action. Our approach will
continue to seek a dismissal on all items related to this legal action. We believe the case is without merit and will defend our position
vigorously. Based on the Company’s assessment of a favorable decision by the court no liability has been recorded on our balance
sheet at December 31, 2022.
NOTE 7 –
NOTES PAYABLE AND CONVERTIBLE TERM
NOTES
On December 23, 2022 we reduced
the original balance principal by $250,000 of our December 21, 2021, 10% secured promissory note with a private lender for $250,000, which
was restated in the form of a 10% secured promissory note for $255,000 with a maturity date of December 31, 2022, with the same private
lender. At December 31, 2022 the balance owed was $5,000 and accrued interest.
On December
15, 2022 the Company converted one $50,000 note of the seven separate investors totaling an aggregate of $700,000 which had origination
dates ranging from May to September 2019 which contain an interest rate of 7% and mature on the second anniversary date of the respective
notes. The note was converted into 13,889 shares common stock and 1,289 shares of common stock for accrued interest. The remaining balances
outstanding at December 31, 2022, on these convertible term notes was $650,000.
On December 15, 2022, we converted a convertible
promissory note with a private lender in the original principal amount of $255,000. The note contained an interest rate of 8% per
year and had a maturity date of July 31, 2022 and was amended to extend the maturity date to October 31, 2022. The note was
converted into 70,833 shares of our common stock and 2,873 shares of our common stock for accrued interest through December 15,
2022.
On August 23, 2022, we entered into the 2022 Convertible Note with
the 2022 Noteholder for an aggregate original principal amount of $4,100,000. In connection with the 2022 Convertible Note, we issued
to the 2022 Noteholder a five-year warrant (referred to herein as the “2022 Noteholder Warrant”) to purchase shares of our
common stock in an amount equal to 33.33% of the number of shares received by the 2022 Noteholder from the conversion of the 2022 Convertible
Note, which number of shares will increase to an amount equal to 50% of the number of shares received by the 2022 Noteholder from the
conversion of the 2022 Convertible Note if within 90 days after the date of the 2022 Convertible Note either (i) we have not completed
an initial public offering, or (ii) the shares of common stock underlying the 2022 Noteholder Warrant are not registered for resale pursuant
to an effective registration statement declared effective by the SEC. The 2022 Noteholder Warrant is exercisable upon conversion of the
2022 Convertible Note or an event of default under the 2022 Convertible Note, and the exercise price of the 2022 Noteholder Warrant is
equal to 1.25 times the conversion price for the 2022 Convertible Note. On December 6, 2022, the 2022 Noteholder agreed to convert all
of the 2022 Convertible Note and accrued interest into 1,332,825 shares of our common stock concurrently with and conditioned upon
the pricing of our initial public offering.  As a result of such conversion of the 2022 Convertible Note, the 2022 Noteholder Warrant
will be exercisable for 666,413 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $3.94 per share. On December 6, 2022, the 2022
Noteholder was issued the 666,413 warrants related to the induced conversion of the 2022 Convertible Note. We valued these warrants at
the conversion date of December 6, 2022 in the amount of $2,038,000 using Black-Scholes valuation method and assumptions
that consider, among other factors, the fair value of the underlying stock, risk free interest rate, volatility, and expected life.
We had convertible notes with a discount with four separate investors
totaling an aggregate of $1.75 million. The notes contain a provision that the debt will be paid through a conversion to common stock
at a discount of 20%. As a result, we have imputed a discount of $350,000 as of the inception of the notes. The notes originated from
July to September 2019, with an anticipated due date of December 31, 2022. The conversion trading price of stock was $4.50
per share, giving an effective conversion price of $3.60 per share after the discount. During December 2022, all four separate investors
converted the aggregate balance outstanding during the time of $1.75 million into 392,131 shares of our common stock.
12
On December 19, 2022 we paid in full the
$750,000 original principal balance on an a $750,000 20% Subordinated Note dated July 12, 2022. The original note had an original
maturity date of the earlier of 30 days from execution or the Company’s IPO date. The maturity date was subsequently modified
to a date later than the closing of the IPO on December 14, 2022 in which the Company paid the outstanding balance and accrued
interest in full on December 19, 2022.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 the
Company paid the full outstanding balances on five separate revolving promissory notes with related entities, Lucid Technologies, LLC
for $432,337, Private Co LLC for $304,410, Mix 1, LLC for $3,500, Pubco LLC for $24,000, Dolce B, LLC for $18,500. All these entities
are controlled by our Chief Executive Officer. These notes were non-interest bearing, unsecured, and were payable on September 30, 2023
or earlier at the option of the Company.
We have a note with a private lender, dated May
14, 2019, with an original principal balance of $100,000 and an original maturity date of September 5, 2019. The note has been
re-negotiated on several occasions and has a current maturity date of December 31, 2022. Accrued interest was capped at $46,500,
which can be paid in shares of our common stock valued at $4 per share. The principal balance outstanding on the note at December
31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 was $72,500. The note is unsecured.

INCOME TAXES
We
compute income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes . Under the
asset and liability method, we determine deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and measure them using currently enacted tax rates and laws. We provide a
valuation allowance for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are more likely than not to be
realized. Realization of our net operating loss carryforward was not reasonably assured as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, and we have recorded a related valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities in
the accompanying financial statements.
As
of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, we had federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards.
We
are subject to limitations existing under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (Change of Control) relating to the availability of the
operating loss, therefore utilization of a portion of our net operating loss may be limited in future years.
As
of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 we had no Internal Revenue Service or state tax examinations. Therefore, all periods
since inception are subject to audit.

Overview
We
are a high-tech diamond company that uses our proprietary technology to produce high-quality, single crystal diamonds and diamond materials
through a CVD process, which we refer to as our Diamond Technology. Lab-grown diamonds have the exact physical, chemical, and optical
properties of the best mined diamonds. Lab-grown diamonds are composed of a pure carbon lattice, just like mined diamonds, and are not
considered synthetic or simulant diamonds like cubic zirconia and moissanite. Simulants are other chemical compounds that resemble diamonds
but do not possess the same hardness, thermal characteristics, band gap energy, and light reflectivity as diamond, whether mined or lab-grown.
14
We
use our Diamond Technology to produce finished diamonds that we intend to sell wholesale and retail for jewelry and rough unfinished
diamond materials that we intend to sell wholesale and retail for industrial uses. We are in the initial phases of commercializing diamonds
and diamond materials, and our primary mission is the development of a profitable and sustainable commercial production model for the
manufacture and sale of diamonds and diamond materials, which are suitable for known, emerging, and anticipated industrial, technology,
and consumer applications.
Since
acquiring the Scio assets over three years ago, we have focused our efforts on research and development of improvements to the fundamental
CVD process. Like most high-tech manufacturers, the philosophy of continuous improvement is at our core. Our development efforts have
focused on commercialization of the diamonds and diamond materials we produce, improvements in our white diamond process, improvements
in our diamond seed processes, automation in our machine operation, expansion of our capacity with our existing machines, and improvements
in our laser cutting procedures. The guiding principle of these efforts is to provide the highest quality diamonds and diamond materials
in a consistent and high-yield manner.
We
currently have limited available commercial products and have to date sold minimal diamonds or diamond materials to consumers or commercial
buyers. Our current operations, until just recently, have been dedicated to the research and development of our Diamond Technology and
the exploration of markets that we may exploit in the future. While we are unable to predict the timing of our entry into any market
in the future, we will strive to produce on a large scale high-quality finished and raw diamond materials and to pursue related commercial
opportunities.

Components
of Results of Operations
Net
Sales
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, we had net sales of $726,125 compared to no net sales for the three months ended December 31,
2021.
We
anticipate deriving continuing future revenue from the following business lines:
●
Direct
Sales of Diamonds:  The sale of diamond gemstones direct to the consumer through our website and the sale of industrial grade
diamonds direct to industrial manufacturing companies.
●
Wholesale
of Diamonds:  The sale of diamonds to wholesalers, distributors, and jewelers.
Cost
of Goods Sold
Cost
of goods sold includes direct costs (parts, material, and labor), indirect manufacturing costs (manufacturing overhead, depreciation,
plant operating lease expense, and rent), shipping, lab services, and logistics costs.
Costs of goods sold for the three months ended December
31, 2022, were $134,846.
Gross margin for the three months ended December 31,
2022, was $591,279 or a gross profit margin on diamond sales of 81% for the three months ended December 31, 2022.
There
were no costs of goods sold nor any related gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2021, to compare to the current year.
Research
and Development Expense
We
conduct research and development activities to enhance existing processes and products and develop new processes and products at our
facilities in Greenville, South Carolina, utilizing our personnel and strategic relationships. We expense all costs associated with our
research and development efforts through either our cost of goods sold, as they are performed by the same employees who produce our finished
product, or through our general and administrative expenses if the product has not been brought to market.
We
expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development
activities to achieve our operational and commercial goals.
Operating
Expense
Operating
expense includes selling, general and administrative expense, employee salaries and related expense and depreciation and amortization
expense. Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal and professional, consulting services and all non-personnel-related
expenses or depreciation and amortization. Personnel-related expenses consist of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, and stock-based compensation.
Depreciation and amortization expenses are related to the Company’s fixed assets and intangible assets.
Operating
expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022, included in the statement of operations was $7.3 million compared to $1.0 million
in the comparison to the comparable prior period.
We
expect our operating expense to increase for the foreseeable future as we scale headcount and expenses with the growth of our business,
build out our manufacturing facilities, refine our production processes, drive for productivity improvements, acquire new and retain
existing customers, and incur additional costs as a result of being a public company.
Other
Expenses
Interest
Expense
Interest
expense consists of interest paid and accrued on our notes payable, promissory notes and the amortization of debt issue costs.
Interest expense was $2.2 million for the three months
ended December 31, 2022, compared to $0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This increase in interest expense was
due primarily the warrants issued for notes converted and partly to higher net borrowings and outstanding indebtedness for the three months
ended December 31, 2022, versus the three months ended December 31, 2021.
16
Net
Loss
Primarily
as a result of the above factors we had a net loss of $9.0 million compared to a net loss of $1.1 million for the three months ended
December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
As
of December 31, 2022, we had $3.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $3.4 million from September 30, 2022.
Changes
in cash flows are summarized as follows:
Operating
Activities
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $1.7 million. This was
primarily the result of net loss of approximately $9.0 million, increases to our period end accounts receivable of $0.3 million and
accrued interest decrease of $0.4 million which was offset primarily by increases in accrued liabilities of $1.4 million, inventory of $0.2
million and accrued payroll and related of $0.8 million along with an offset by the benefit of non-cash expenses for employee stock
compensation of $3.7 million and warrants issued for conversion of $2.0 million.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $.9 million. This was primarily
the result of net loss of approximately $1.1 million.
Investing
Activities
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, we used $1.3 million for investing activities related to purchase of machinery and equipment.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2021, we used no cash for investing activities.
Financing
Activities
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $6.4 million. This was the net
effect of $9.1 million we received as net proceeds from our IPO which closed on December 14, 2022 offset by $0.6 million used to reduce related party notes, $1.0 million to reduce notes payable and $1.2 million to acquire treasury stock during the three
months ended December 31, 2022.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $0.8 million. This was primarily
the net effect of $0.7 million of increased note borrowings and $0.1 million in related party activity.
These
conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the ensuing year. Our independent auditors have
added an explanatory paragraph in their audit opinion in regard to this uncertainty and can be found in the Company’s Annual Form
10K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Satisfaction
of our Cash Obligations for the Next 12 Months
Our
recent IPO which closed on December 14, 2022 gave us gross proceeds of $11.0 million before direct IPO expenses and fees associated with
underwriting. These funds along with the ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity and/or debt financing are anticipated
to meet our operating needs. We are not currently generating sufficient revenue to meet operating needs. In the event we cannot obtain
additional capital to pursue our strategic plan, however, this would materially impact our ability to continue as a going concern.
Since
inception, we have financed cash flow requirements through debt financing and the private issuance of common stock for cash and services
along with advances from our CEO as well as our CEO and CFO deferring significant compensation and benefits that were earned under their
respective employment contracts. If we continue to experience cash flow deficiencies, we would be required to obtain additional financing
to fund operations through private common stock offerings and debt borrowings to the extent necessary to provide working capital. However,
there is no assurance we would be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
17
We
intend to implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy, continue to develop, and upgrade technology and products,
respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be
successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial
condition, and results of operations.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources
that is material to investors.
Critical
Accounting Policies
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affected the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates
made in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements include the valuation of allowances for doubtful accounts, valuation
of deferred tax assets, inventories, useful lives of assets, goodwill, intangible assets, and stock-based compensation. A summary of
our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, under “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” There have been no significant changes to these policies
during the three months ended December 31, 2022. For disclosure regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the anticipated impact
they will have on our operations, please refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls
and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
Our controls were ineffective due to the size of the Company and available resources. There are limited personnel to assist with the
accounting and financial reporting function, which results in: (i) a lack of segregation of duties and (ii) controls that may not be
adequately designed or operating effectively. Despite the existence of material weaknesses, the Company believes the financial information
presented herein is materially correct and fairly presents the financial position and operating results of the three months ended December
31, 2022, and 2021 in accordance with GAAP.
Changes
in internal controls
There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, during
the quarterly period from October 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
