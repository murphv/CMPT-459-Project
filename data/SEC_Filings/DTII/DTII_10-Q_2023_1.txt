Defense Technologies International Corp. and Subsidiary
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
As of January 31, 2023
(Unaudited)
NOTE - 1:
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ORGANIZATION
Defense Technologies International Corp. (the "Company ") was incorporated in the State of
Delaware
on
May 27, 1998 .  Effective June 15, 2016, the Company changed its name to Defense Technologies International Corp. from Canyon Gold Corp. to more fully represent the Company's expansion goals into the advanced technology sector.
On October 19, 2016, the Company entered into a Definitive Agreement with Controlled Capture Systems, LLC (“CCS”), representing the inventor of the technology and assets previously acquired by DTC, that included a new exclusive Patent License Agreement and Independent Contractor agreement. Under the license agreement with CCS, the Company acquired the world-wide exclusive rights and privileges to the CCS security technology, patents, products and improvements.  The Company agreed to pay CCS an initial licensing fee of $25,000 and to pay ongoing royalties as defined in the Definitive Agreement.
On May 30, 2018, the Company and Control Capture Systems, LLC amended their license agreement as follows (1) Royalty payments of 5% of gross sale from the license agreement will be calculated and paid quarterly with a minimum of $12,500 paid each quarter (2) All payment will be in US dollars or stock of the Company and or its subsidiary. The value of the stock will be a discount to the market of 25% of the average trading price for the 10 days prior to conversion. The number of shares received by Control Capture prior to any reverse split are anti-dilutive (3)Invoices for parts and materials will be billed separate of the license fees noted above .
Effective January 12, 2017, Passive Security Scan, Inc. ("PSSI") was incorporated in the state of Utah as subsidiary controlled by the Company.  The Company transferred to PSSI its exclusive world-wide license to the defense, detection and protection security products previously acquired by the Company. The Company currently owns 76.28% of PSSI with 23.72% acquired by several individuals and entities. The Company’s unique technology works precisely to specifications as required by our technology and as confirmed in the market. All sales and marketing activities will be executed through PSSI.
On June 28, 2022 the Company’s common shares were reversed with each shareholder receiving one share of common stock for each 500 shares held before the reverse split. The number of shares throughout the disclosure have been retrospectively adjusted
to represent the number of shares after the reverse split.
Basis of Presentation
These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The Company’s fiscal year end is April 30.
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared without audit in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Form 10-Q. They do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. Therefore, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended April 30, 2022 included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
7
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the Company’s consolidated financial position as of January 31, 2023, the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022.
The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year.
Consolidation and Non-Controlling Interest
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, and its majority-owned subsidiary, PSSI, from its formation on January 12, 2017 to date.  All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Reclassification
The Company is reclassing the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet
for the year ended April 30, 2022 due to a reclassification of series D preferred from mezzanine equity to equity. Initially, the 600 shares of series D preferred were presented in mezzanine equity. The reclassification reduces the mezzanine equity from 600,000 to zero and increase paid in capital to 600,000. Although the series D preferred were in the settlement of convertible notes, and the convertible into common stock, the conversion feature is not set and at the election of the board of directors. The Company also
reclassed
series A preferred shares increasing the preferred A shares
by 59 reducing paid in capital by the same amount. The impact of the reclassification effect only the balance sheet presented as of April 30, 2022.
During the nine months period ended January 31, 2023, the Company reclassified 25,000 preferred series B shares to be issued from issued as the shares had not been issued as of the date of reporting. The share reduced paid in capital previously reported.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method of accounting. Inventories as of January 31, 2023 consist of parts used in assembly of the units being sold plus work in progress and finished goods. As of January 31, 2023 the value of the inventory was $ 103,122 , consisting of raw materials of $ 2,873
and finished goods of $ 100,249
with no work in process compared to an inventory value of
$ 69,649
as of April 30, 2022.
Equipment
Equipment is carried at the cost of acquisition and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Costs associated with repair and maintenance is expensed as incurred. Costs associated with improvements which extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the efficiency of our property and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the related asset. Gains and losses on dispositions of equipment are reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
8
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows.
If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.
Net Income (Loss) per Common Share
Basic net income or loss per common share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net income or loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income or loss per common share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net income or loss by sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the dilutive potential common share equivalents then outstanding. Potential dilutive common share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method and the average market price per share during the period, and conversion of convertible debt, using the if converted method. As of January 31, 2023, the Company had potential shares issuable under convertible preferred shares and convertible debt for a total of 13,438,558.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU) No 2020-06 Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivative and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contract’s in an Entity’s own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it. The ASU simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas.  The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods has been amended for small businesses to  beginning after December 15, 2023 as early adoption was permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company evaluated  there is no impact this new guidance will have on its financial statements.
NOTE - 2:
GOING CONCERN
These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern. Through January 31, 2023, the Company had no revenues, has accumulated deficit of $ 16,147,532
and a working capital deficit of $ 1,614,053
and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover operating costs, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Management plans to continue to provide for the Company's capital needs during the year ending April 30, 2023 by issuing debt and equity securities and by the continued support of its related parties. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.

NOTE – 7:  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES
As defined in (Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC 820), fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilized the market data of similar entities in its industry or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. FASB ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level 1    –  Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives, marketable securities and listed equities.
Level 2     -
Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date and includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, options and collars.
Level 3     –  Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.
As of January 31, 2023, the Company believes the amounts reported for cash, payables, accrued liabilities and amounts due to related parties approximate their fair values due to the nature or duration of these instruments.

Item 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.
Defense Technologies International Corp. (the "Company ") was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 27, 1998.  Effective June 15, 2016, the Company changed its name to Defense Technologies International Corp. from Canyon Gold Corp. to more fully represent the Company's expansion goals into the advanced technology sector.
On October 19, 2016, the Company entered into a Definitive Agreement with Controlled Capture Systems, LLC (“CCS”), representing the inventor of the technology and assets previously acquired by DTC, that included a new exclusive Patent License Agreement and Independent Contractor agreement. Under the license agreement with CCS, the Company acquired the world-wide exclusive rights and privileges to the CCS security technology, patents, products, and improvements.  The Company agreed to pay CCS an initial licensing fee of $25,000 and to pay ongoing royalties as defined in the Definitive Agreement.
On May 30, 2018, the Company and Control Capture Systems, LLC amended their license agreement as follows (1) Royalty payments of 5% of gross sale from the license agreement will be calculated and paid quarterly with a minimum of $12,500 paid each quarter (2) All payment will be in US dollars or stock of the Company and or its subsidiary. The value of the stock will be a discount to market of 25% of the average trading price for the 10 days prior to conversion. The number of shares received by Control Capture prior to any reverse split are anti-dilutive.
Effective January 12, 2017, Passive Security Scan, Inc. ("PSSI") was incorporated in the state of Utah as subsidiary controlled by the Company. The Company transferred to PSSI its exclusive world-wide license to the defense, detection and protection security products previously acquired by the Company. The Company owns 79.8% of PSSI with 20.2% acquired by several individuals and entities. The Company plans to continue the development of the technology. All sales and marketing activities are through PSSI.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may directly or indirectly impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations is highly uncertain and subject to change. We considered the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our estimates and assumptions and there was not a material impact to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended January 31, 2023.
The Company’s security products are licensed from CCS and developed by the company designed for personal and collateral protection. Products derived from this technology are intended to provide passive security scanning units for either walk-through or hand-held use to improve security for schools and other public facilities. Passive Portal units use electromagnets and do not emit anything (such as x-rays) through the subject. We have also completed a prototype with optional “Digital Imaging,” which will give the user of the scanner the ability to recall the entire traffic passing through the scanner at any time thereafter.
As of May 19, 2020, the Company added an IR Camera for detection of elevated body temperatures and is presently offering three products:
● PASSIVE PORTAL – Screens for Weapons only;
● PASSIVE PORTAL with EBT – Screens for Weapons and elevated body temperature;
● EBT Station – Screens for elevated body temperature only.

Results of Operations
During the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company did not receive any revenue.
Our operating
expenses for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023, was $183,061 and $1,485,465 compared to $239,472 and $649,347 for the same period in 2022. The increase was due primarily to higher consulting costs, which were $1,022,900 and higher development costs of $259,243 for the nine months periods ending January 31, 2023. The Company recorded depreciation of $2,846 and $8,676 and general and administrative costs of $42,715 and $194,645 for the three and nine month periods ended January 31, 2023, compared to depreciation of $2,915 and $8,745 and general and administrative expense of  $116,557 and $265,602 for the same periods in 2022.
Interest expenses incurred in the three months and nine months periods ended January 31, 2023, was $8,519 and expense of $60,263 compared to interest expense of $28,658 and $78,990 for the three and nine month periods in 2022.
Change in derivative liability resulted in a gain of $216,920 for the nine months period ended January 31, 2023, compared to a net gain of $141,172 for the same period in 2022  We estimate the fair value of the derivative for the conversion feature of our convertible notes payable using the American Binominal Lattice pricing model at the inception of the debt, at the date of conversions to equity, cash payments and at reporting date, recording a derivative liability, debt discount and a gain or loss on change in derivative liability as applicable.  These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price volatility, and variable conversion prices based on market prices as defined in the respective loan agreements. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liability will fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuation may be material.
Other expenses for the three and nine month periods ending January 31, 2023, included interest from note discount of $30,450 and $76,126 compared to zero and $90,060 for the same periods in 2022. A loss on the settlement of debt and accruals of $849,329 for the nine month period ended January 31, 2023, compared to none for the same period in 2022.
Total other income and expense for the three and nine month periods ended  January 31, 2023 was other income of $14,891  and  other expense of $746,172 compared to
other income  of $85,694 and $35,378 for the same periods  in 2022. The loss in the three and nine months periods ending January 31, 2023 are primarily due to the loss on the settlement of debt and accruals in the nine months
period in 2023.
Net loss before non-controlling interest for the three and nine month periods ended January 31, 2023 were a net loss of  $168,170 and $2,231,637 compared net loss of $153,778 and $684,725 for the same periods in 2022. After adjusting for our consolidated subsidiary, net loss and net income for the three and nine month period ended January 31, 2023 were net loss of $157,854 and $2,205,043 compared to a net loss of $143,765 and $654,725 for the same period in 2022.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
At January 31, 2023, the Company had total current assets of $110,881 and total current liabilities of $1,724,934 resulting in a working capital deficit of $1,614,059 Included in our current liabilities and working capital deficit at January 31, 2023 are derivative liabilities totaling $58,038 related to the conversion features of certain of our convertible notes payable, convertible notes of $351,253, net of discount, payables due related parties of $808,128, accounts payable and accrued expense of $153,018 and notes payables of $160,642. We anticipate that in the short term, operating funds will continue to be provided by related parties and other lenders.
During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was $83,602 compared to cash used of $213,404 in the same period in 2022. Net cash used in the nine month 2023 period consisted of net loss of $2,231,637, loss on settlement of accrued expense of $849,329 and change in payables to related parties of $87,707 and change in accounts payable of $541,416.
During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $85,600 consisting of a note payable of $115,600 offset by repayment of a note payable of $30,000.
We have had minimal  revenue and paid expenses and costs with proceeds from the issuance of securities as well as by loans from investor, stockholders and other related parties.
Our immediate goal is to provide funding for the completion of the  production of the Offender Alert Passive Scan licensed from CCS. The Offender Alert Passive Scan is an advanced passive scanning system for detecting and identifying concealed threats.
We have built 33 Passive Portal units, two of which were used in the previously announced BETA Test at a school near Austin Tx and  5 were sold. The units have been tested multiple times and performed with a 100% success every time. We are confident that upon the successful conclusion of the Beta Test, we will receive the first orders from  school districts that will generate initial revenues to the Company.
We believe a related party and other lenders will provide sufficient funds to carry on general operations in the near term and fund DTC’s production and sales.  We expect to raise additional funds from the sale of securities, stockholder loans and convertible debt.  However, we may not be successful in our efforts to obtain financing to carry out our business plan.
See the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have either implemented or that may have a material future impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

We operate with a limited number of accounting and financial personnel. Although we retain the services of an experienced certified public accountant, we have been unable to implement proper segregation of duties over certain accounting and financial reporting processes, including timely and proper documentation of material transactions and agreements. We believe these control deficiencies represent material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.
Despite the material weaknesses in financial reporting noted above, we believe that our consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in all material respects.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
