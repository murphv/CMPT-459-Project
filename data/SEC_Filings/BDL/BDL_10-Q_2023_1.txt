FLANIGAN’S ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND JANUARY
1, 2022
(1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION:
The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial information for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 is unaudited. Financial information as of
October 1, 2022 has been derived from the audited financial statements of Flanigan’s Enterprises, Inc., a Florida corporation,
together with its subsidiaries, (the “Company”, “we”, “our”, “ours” and
“us” as the context requires), but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information for the periods indicated have been included. For further information
regarding the Company's accounting policies, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 1, 2022. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for a full year.
The condensed consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and the accounts of the ten limited partnerships in which we act as general
partner and have controlling interests. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Non-controlling interest represents
the limited partners’ proportionate share of the net assets and results of operations of the eight limited partnerships.
The consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for condensed
interim reporting are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We are required to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, and revenue and expenses during the period reported.  These estimates include assessing
the estimated useful lives of tangible assets, the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and estimates relating to the calculation
of incremental borrowing rates and length of leases associated with right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities and estimates relating
to loyalty reward programs.  Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in our
consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge
of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.
Although these estimates are based on management’s
knowledge of current events and actions it may take in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.
Certain amounts presented in the financial statements previously issued
for the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022 have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the thirteen weeks ended December
31, 2022.
(2) EARNINGS PER SHARE:
We follow Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Section 260 - “ Earnings per Share ”. This section provides for the calculation
of basic and diluted earnings per share. The data on Page 2 shows the amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effects on
income. As of December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, no stock options or other potentially dilutive securities were outstanding.
(3) RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:
Adopted
There are no accounting pronouncements that we have
recently adopted.
8
Table of Contents
(3) RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:
(Continued)
Recently Issued
The FASB issued guidance, Reference Rate Reform
(Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides an optional expedient and
exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions
affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. In response to the concerns about structural risks of interbank
offered rates (“IBORs”) and, particularly, the risk of cessation of the LIBOR, regulators in several jurisdictions
around the world have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference rates that are more observable
or transaction based and less susceptible to manipulation. This accounting standards update provides companies with optional
guidance to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be
discontinued. LIBOR rates will be published until June 30, 2023. All principal and interest of the Term Loan was paid during the
first quarter of our fiscal year 2023, so the discontinuance of LIBOR rates had no impact on us.
There are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements
that we have not yet adopted that we believe will have a material effect on our financial statements.
(4) INCOME TAXES:
We account for our income taxes using FASB ASC Topic 740, “ Income Taxes ”, which requires among other things, recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to the extent that realization of said tax benefits is more likely than not. The Company’s income tax expense computed at the statutory federal rate of
21 % differs from its effective tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and income tax credits.
(5) DEBT:
Payoff of Term Loan
During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023,
we satisfied the principal balance and all accrued interest due on our $ 5.5
million term loan to our unrelated lender. The outstanding
principal balance ($ 367,000 ) and accrued interest ($- 0 -) was paid in full on December 28, 2022.
In February 2023, we determined that as of December 31, 2022, we did not meet the required
Post-Distribution Basic Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the “Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant”) contained in each of our
six (6) loans (the “Institutional Loans”) with our unrelated third party institutional lender (the “Institutional Lender’).
The Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant requires we maintain a ratio of at least
1.15
to
1.00
and for the twelve (12) months ended
December 31, 2022 our ratio was calculated to be
1.13
to
1.00 . On February 23, 2023, we received from the Institutional Lender, a written
waiver of the non-compliance with the Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant (the “Covenant Non-Compliance”), pursuant to
which, among other things, the Institutional Lender waived (1) the non-compliance as of December 31, 2022 and (2) their right to exercise
certain remedies under the Institutional Loans, including the right to accelerate the indebtedness owed by us thereunder, resulting in
the indebtedness under the Institutional Loans to be immediately due and payable, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
We believe we will regain compliance with the Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant as of the end of our second fiscal quarter of our
fiscal year ending September 30, 2023 and going forward. We have prepared projections for the next year, including estimated covenant
calculations for the next four (4) fiscal quarters and we expect to be in compliance. As a result, our classification of debt is appropriate
as of December 31, 2022.
For further information regarding the Company's long-term debt, refer to
the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended October
1, 2022.
(6) INSURANCE PREMIUMS
During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023, for the policy year commencing December 30, 2022, we agreed on the following property, general liability, excess liability and terrorist policies, totaling approximately $ 3.281
million, for which the premiums were paid in full subsequent to December 31, 2022. The coverage described above includes coverage for our franchises (which is $ 658,000 ), which are not included in our consolidated financial statements:

Leases
To conduct certain of our operations, we lease restaurant
and package liquor store space in South Florida from unrelated third parties. Our leases have remaining lease terms of up to
10
years,
some of which include options to renew and extend the lease terms for up to an additional
30
years. We presently intend to renew some
of the extension options available to us and for purposes of computing the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities required by ASC 842,
we have incorporated into all lease terms which may be extended, an additional term of the lesser of (i) the amount of years the lease
may be extended; or (ii) 15 years.
Following adoption of ASC 842 during the year ended October 3, 2020, common area maintenance
and property taxes are not considered to be lease components.

Litigation
Our sale of alcoholic beverages subjects us
to “dram shop” statutes, which allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic beverages
to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage or if we fail to maintain our insurance
coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We currently
have no “dram shop” claims.
From time to time, we are a party to various
other claims, legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary course of our business, including claims resulting from “slip
and fall” accidents, claims under federal and state laws governing access to public accommodations, employment-related claims and
claims from guests alleging illness, injury or other food quality, health or operational concerns. It is our opinion, after consulting
with legal counsel, that all such matters are without merit or involve such amounts that an unfavorable disposition, some of which is
covered by insurance, would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
(8) CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC:
In March 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was declared
a global pandemic and a National Public Health Emergency. The novel coronavirus pandemic and related “shelter-in-place” orders
and other governmental mandates relating thereto (collectively, “COVID-19”) adversely affected and will, in all likelihood
continue to adversely affect, our restaurant operations and financial results for the foreseeable future.
12
Table of Contents
During the second quarter of our fiscal year 2021,
certain of the entities owning the limited partnership stores (the “LP’s”), as well as the store we manage but do not
own (the “Managed Store”), applied for and received loans from an unrelated third party lender pursuant to the Paycheck Protection
Program (the “PPP”) under the United States Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”)
enacted March 27, 2020, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $ 3.98
million, (the “2 nd
PPP Loans”),
of which approximately: (i) $ 3.35
million was loaned to six of the LP’s; and (ii) $ 0.63
million was loaned to the Managed Store.
The 2 nd
PPP Loan to the Managed Store is not included in our consolidated financial statements. During the first quarter of
our fiscal year 2022, we applied for and received forgiveness of the entire amount of principal and accrued interest for all 2 nd
PPP Loans, including the Managed Store.
COVID-19 has had a material adverse effect on our
access to supplies or labor and there can be no assurance that there will not be a significant adverse impact on our supply chain or access
to labor in the future. We are actively monitoring our food suppliers to assess how they are managing their operations to mitigate supply
flow and food safety risks. To ensure we mitigate potential supply availability risk, we are building additional inventory back stock
levels when appropriate and we have also identified alternative supply sources in key product categories including but not limited to
food, sanitation and safety supplies.
(9) BUSINESS SEGMENTS:
We operate in two reportable segments –
package stores and restaurants. The operation of package stores consists of retail liquor sales and related items. The operation of
restaurants consists of restaurant food and bar sales. Information concerning the revenues and operating income for the thirteen
weeks ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, and identifiable assets for the two reportable segments in which we operate, are
shown in the following table. Operating income is total revenue less cost of merchandise sold and operating expenses relative to
each segment. In computing operating income, none of the following items have been included: interest expense, other non-operating
income and expenses and income taxes. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets that are used in our operations in each
segment. Corporate assets are principally cash and real property, improvements, furniture, equipment and vehicles used at our
corporate headquarters. We do not have any operations outside of the United States and transactions between restaurants and package
liquor stores are not material.

unit; (ii) the unit is owned by a limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner and/or have invested in; or (iii) the
unit is franchised by us), as of December 31, 2022 and as compared to October 1, 2022. With the exception of “The
Whale’s Rib”, a restaurant we operate but do not own, and “Brendan’s Sports Pub” a restaurant/bar we
own, all of the restaurants operate under our service marks “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” or
“Flanigan’s” and all of the package liquor stores operate under our service marks “Big Daddy’s

Notes:
(1) During the first quarter of our fiscal
year 2019, our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19), was
damaged by a fire which has caused it to be closed since the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. During the first quarter of our fiscal
year 2023, we opened our newly built stand-alone package liquor store on this site replacing our package liquor store destroyed by fire
and previously operating here. We are constructing a stand-alone restaurant building on this site (adjacent to the package liquor store),
replacing our restaurant destroyed by fire and previously operating here. We do not believe this restaurant will be operational during
our fiscal year 2023.

Table of Contents
(2) During the third quarter of our fiscal
year 2022, we entered into a new lease for the business premises and purchased the assets of a restaurant/bar known as “Brendan’s
Sports Pub” located at 868 S. Federal Highway, Pompano Beach, Florida and began operating the location under its current trade name.
(3) During the second quarter of our
fiscal year 2022, our limited partnership owned restaurant located at 14301 West Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida (Store #85)
opened for business in March, 2022 (the “2022 Sunrise Restaurant”). Our limited partnership owned restaurant located at
11225 Miramar Parkway #250, Miramar, Florida (Store #25) is expected to open for business during the second quarter of our fiscal
year 2023 (the “2023 Miramar Restaurant”).
(4) We operate a restaurant for
one (1) franchisee. This unit is included in the table both as a franchised restaurant, as well as a restaurant operated by us.
Franchise Financial Arrangement : In exchange
for our providing management and related services to our franchisees and granting them the right to use our service marks “Flanigan’s
Seafood Bar and Grill” and “Big Daddy’s Liquors”, our franchisees (four of which are franchised to members of
the family of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors), are required to (i) pay to us a royalty equal to 1% of gross package
store sales and 3% of gross restaurant sales; and (ii) make advertising expenditures equal to between 1.5% to 3% of all gross sales based
upon our actual advertising costs allocated between stores, pro-rata, based upon gross sales.
Limited Partnership Financial Arrangement :
We manage and control the operations of all restaurants owned by limited partnerships, except the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant
which is owned by a related franchisee. Accordingly, the results of operations of all limited partnership owned restaurants, except the
Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are consolidated into our operations for accounting purposes. The results of operations of the Fort
Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are accounted for by us utilizing the equity method of accounting. In general, until the investors’
cash investment in a limited partnership (including any cash invested by us and our affiliates) is returned in full, the limited partnership
distributes to the investors annually out of available cash from the operation of the restaurant up to 25% of the cash invested in the
limited partnership, with no management fee paid to us. Any available cash in excess of the 25% of the cash invested in the limited partnership
distributed to the investors annually, is paid one-half (½) to us as a management fee, with the balance distributed to the investors.
Once the investors in the limited partnership have received, in full, amounts equal to their cash invested, an annual management fee is
payable to us equal to one-half (½) of cash available to the limited partnership, with the other one half (½) of available
cash distributed to the investors (including us and our affiliates). As of December 31, 2022, all limited partnerships, with the exception
of the 2022 Sunrise Restaurant, which opened for business in March, 2022 and the 2022 Miramar Restaurant, which we anticipate will open
for business in February, 2023, have returned all cash invested and we receive an annual management fee equal to one-half (½) of
the cash available for distribution by the limited partnership. In addition to receipt of distributable amounts from the limited partnerships,
we receive a fee equal to 3% of gross sales for use of the service mark “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” or “Flanigan’s”.

Comparison of Thirteen Weeks Ended December 31, 2022 and January
1, 2022.
Revenues .
Total
revenue for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 increased $4,458,000 or 11.92% to $41,861,000 from $37,403,000 for the
thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022 due primarily to increased package liquor store and restaurant sales, increased menu prices,
revenue generated from the opening of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida, (Store #85) in March 2022 and
the comparatively less adverse effects of COVID-19 on our operations during the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 as compared
with the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022. Effective October 3, 2021 and then effective December 19, 2021 we increased menu
prices for our food offerings to target an increase to our food revenues of approximately 2.38% and 3.34% annually, respectively, to
offset higher food costs and higher overall expenses and effective December 12, 2021 we increased menu prices for our bar offerings
to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 7.80% annually, (collectively the “Recent Price Increases”).
Prior to these increases, we previously raised menu prices in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2021.
Restaurant
Food Sales .
Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of food,
including non-alcoholic beverages, at restaurants totaled $24,767,000 for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 as compared to
$22,205,000 for the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022.
The increase in restaurant food sales during the thirteen weeks
ended December 31, 2022 as compared to restaurant food sales during the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022 is attributable to the
Recent Price Increases, restaurant food sales generated from the opening of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise,
Florida, (Store #85) in March 2022, the opening of Brendan’s Sports Pub (Store #30) in June, 2022 and the comparatively
greater adverse effects of COVID-19 on our operations during the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022 as compared with the thirteen
weeks ended December 31, 2022. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales (for restaurants open for all of the thirteen weeks ended
December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 respectively, which consists of nine restaurants owned by us and eight restaurants owned by
affiliated limited partnerships, (excluding our Sunrise, Florida location, (Store #85), and Brendan’s Sports Pub, (Store #30),
both of which opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022) was $1,770,000 and $1,693,000 for the thirteen
weeks ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively, an increase of 4.55%. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for
Company owned restaurants only was $829,000 and $804,000 for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022,
respectively, an increase of 3.11%. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for affiliated limited partnership owned restaurants only,
(excluding Store #85 which opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022), was $941,000 and $890,000 for the
thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively, an increase of 5.73%. We expect that restaurant food
sales, including non-alcoholic beverages, for the balance of our fiscal year 2023 will increase due to increased restaurant traffic
and the opening for business of the 2023 Miramar Restaurant during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023.
Restaurant Bar Sales .
Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages at restaurants totaled $6,988,000 for the thirteen weeks ended December
31, 2022 as compared to $6,007,000 for the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022. The increase in restaurant bar sales during the thirteen
weeks ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to the Recent Price Increases, restaurant bar sales generated from the opening of our limited
partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida, (Store #85) in March 2022, the opening of Brendan’s Sports Pub (Store #30) in
June, 2022 and the comparatively more adverse effects of COVID-19 on our operations during the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022 as
compared with the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales (for restaurants open for all of the
thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 respectively, which consists of nine restaurants owned by us and eight restaurants
owned by affiliated limited partnerships, (excluding our Sunrise, Florida location, (Store #85), and Brendan’s Sports Pub, (Store
#30), both of which opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022) was $498,000 and $462,000 for the thirteen
weeks ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively, an increase of 7.79%. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales for Company
owned restaurants only was $212,000 and $203,000 for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively, an
increase of 4.43%. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for affiliated limited partnership owned restaurants only, (excluding Store
#85 which opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022), was $286,000 and $259,000 for the thirteen weeks ended
December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively, an increase of 10.42%. We expect that restaurant bar sales, including non-alcoholic
beverages, for the balance of our fiscal year 2023 will increase due to increased restaurant traffic and the opening for business of the
2023 Miramar Restaurant during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023.

Table of Contents
Package Store Sales .
Revenue generated from sales of liquor and related items at package liquor stores totaled $9,403,000 for the thirteen weeks ended December
31 2022 as compared to $8,511,000 for the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022, an increase of $892,000. This increase was primarily due
to increased package liquor store traffic due to what appears to be continued increased demand for package liquor store products resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic. The weekly average of same store package liquor store sales, which includes nine (9) Company-owned package
liquor stores, (excluding Store #19, which was closed for our fiscal years 2022 and 2021 due to a fire on October 2, 2018 but re-opened
for business during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023), was $716,000 and $675,000 for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022
respectively, an increase of 6.07%. We expect that package liquor store sales for our fiscal year 2023 will increase due to increased
package liquor store traffic and the opening of the package liquor stores located at 7990 Davie Road Extension, Hollywood, Florida (Store
#19P) which opened for business during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 and 11225 Miramar Parkway, Miramar, Florida (Store #24)
which we anticipate will open for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2023.
Operating Costs and Expenses .
Operating
costs and expenses, (consisting of cost of merchandise sold, payroll and related costs, occupancy costs and selling, general and administrative
expenses), for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 increased $4,026,000 or 10.99% to $40,664,000 from $36,638,000 for the thirteen
weeks ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased payroll and an expected general increase in food costs, costs
and expenses incurred from the opening of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida, (Store #85) in March 2022, Brendan’s
Sports Pub (Store #30) in June, 2022, pre-opening expenses from our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25)
and pre-opening expenses from our package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24), partially offset by actions taken by management
to reduce and/or control costs. We anticipate that our operating costs and expenses will continue to increase through our fiscal year
2023. Operating costs and expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue to approximately 97.14% for the thirteen weeks ended December
31, 2022 from 97.95% for the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022.
Gross Profit.
Gross profit is calculated
by subtracting the cost of merchandise sold from sales.
Restaurant
Food Sales and Bar Sales .
Gross profit for food and bar sales for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 increased
to $20,949,000 from $17,879,000 for the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022. Our gross profit margin for restaurant food and bar sales
(calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of restaurant food and bar sales), was 65.97% for the thirteen weeks ended December
31, 2022 and 63.37% for the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022.
Gross profit margin for restaurant food and bar sales increased
during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 when compared to the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022 due among other things by
the decrease in our price of ribs and the Recent Price Increases, offset among other things by higher food costs.

Table of Contents
Package
Store Sales .
Gross profit for package store sales for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 increased to $2,419,000
from $2,171,000 for the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022. Our gross profit margin, (calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage
of package liquor store sales), for package store sales was 25.72% for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 and 25.51% for the thirteen
weeks ended January 1, 2022. We anticipate that the gross profit margin for package liquor store merchandise will decrease during our
fiscal year 2023 due to higher costs and a reduction in pricing of certain package store merchandise to be more competitive.
Payroll
and Related Costs.
Payroll and related costs for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 increased $1,400,000 or 11.44%
to $13,636,000 from $12,236,000 for the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022. Payroll and related costs for the thirteen weeks ended
December 31, 2022 were higher due primarily to
the opening of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida,
(Store #85) in March 2022, Brendan’s Sports Pub (Store #30) in June, 2022 and higher salaries to employees to remain
competitive with other potential employers in a tighter labor market.
Payroll and
related costs as a percentage of total revenue was 32.57% in the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 and 32.71% of total revenue
in the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022.
Occupancy
Costs.
Occupancy costs (consisting of percentage rent, common area maintenance, repairs, real property taxes, amortization
of leasehold interests and rent expense associated with operating lease liabilities under ASC 842) for the thirteen weeks ended December
31, 2022 increased $150,000 or 8.83% to $1,848,000 from $1,698,000 for the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022. The increase in occupancy
costs was primarily due to the commencement of rent for our retail package liquor store which we are developing located at 11225 Miramar
Parkway, #245, Miramar, Florida (Store #24) and our restaurant location which we are developing located at 11225 Miramar Parkway, #250,
Miramar, Florida (Store #25) during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022, both of which we anticipate will open during our fiscal
year 2023 and Brendan’s Sports Pub (Store #30) which we acquired and opened for business in June, 2022.
Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (consisting of general corporate
expenses, including but not limited to advertising, insurance, professional costs, clerical and administrative overhead) for the
thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 increased $1,359,000 or 22.53% to $7,390,000 from $6,031,000 for the thirteen weeks ended
January 1, 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue for the thirteen weeks
ended December 31, 2022 to 17.65% as compared to 16.12% for the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022, due primarily to Store #30 and
Store #85 being open during the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 only, inflation and otherwise to increases in expenses across
all categories. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue will increase
throughout the balance of our fiscal year 2023 due primarily to increases across all categories.
Depreciation and Amortization.
Depreciation
and amortization expense for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses,
increased $122,000 or 17.45% to $821,000 from $699,000 from the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022. As a percentage of total revenue,
depreciation and amortization expense was 1.96% of revenue in the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 and 1.83% of revenue in the thirteen
weeks ended January 1, 2022.
Interest Expense, Net .
Interest expense,
net, for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 increased $82,000 to $275,000 from $193,000 for the thirteen weeks ended January 1,
2022. Interest expense, net, increased for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 due to the interest on our borrowing of $8,900,000
during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2022 from an unrelated third party lender to re-finance the mortgage loan on our property
located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale Beach, Florida (Store #31).

Income Taxes.
Income tax for the thirteen
weeks ended December 31, 2022 was an expense of $63,000, as compared to an expense of $147,000 for the thirteen weeks ended January 1,
2022.
Net Income.
Net income for the
thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 decreased $3,064,000 or 77.81% to $874,000 from $3,938,000 for the thirteen weeks ended
January 1, 2022 due primarily to the $3,488,000 of income attributable to the forgiveness of debt of certain of our 2 nd
PPP Loans during the first quarter ended January 1, 2022, higher food costs and overall increased expenses during the thirteen weeks
ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by increased revenue at our retail package liquor stores and restaurants and the Recent
Price Increases. As a percentage of revenue, net income for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 is 2.09%, as compared to
10.53% in the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022.
Net Income Attributable to
Flanigan’s Enterprises, Inc. Stockholders.
Net income attributable to Flanigan’s Enterprises, Inc. stockholders
for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 decreased $940,000 or 60.10% to $624,000 from $1,564,000 for the thirteen weeks ended
January 1, 2022 due primarily to the income attributable to the forgiveness of debt of certain of our 2 nd
PPP Loans
during the first quarter ended January 1, 2022, (net of the amount attributable to noncontrolling interests), higher food costs and
overall increased expenses during the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by increased revenue at our retail
package liquor stores and restaurants and the Recent Price Increases. As a percentage of revenue, net income attributable to
Flanigan’s Enterprises, Inc. stockholders for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 is 1.49%, as compared to 4.18% for
the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022.
New Limited Partnership Restaurants
As new restaurants open, our income from operations
will be adversely affected due to our obligation to advance pre-opening costs, including but not limited to pre-opening rent for the new
locations. During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023, we had one new restaurant location in Miramar, Florida in the development
stage, which location will house a new “Flanigan’s”. Rent for the new restaurant location in Miramar, Florida commenced
during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022.
Menu Price Increases and Trends
During the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022,
we did not increase our menu prices. During the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022, we increased menu prices for our food offerings
(effective October 3, 2021 and December 19, 2021, respectively) to target an aggregate increase to our food revenues of approximately
8.83% annually and we increased menu prices for our bar offerings (effective December 12, 2021) to target an increase to our bar revenues
of approximately 7.80% annually to offset higher food and liquor costs and higher overall expenses. Prior to these increases, we previously
raised menu prices in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2021.
COVID-19 has and will continue to materially
and adversely affect our restaurant business for what may be a prolonged period of time. This damage and disruption has resulted from
events and factors that were impossible for us to predict and are beyond our control. As a result, COVID-19 has materially adversely
affected our results of operations for the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 and will, in all likelihood, impact our results of
operations, liquidity and/or financial condition throughout the balance of our fiscal year 2023. The extent to which our restaurant business
may be adversely impacted and its effect on our operations, liquidity and/or financial condition cannot be accurately predicted.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We fund our operations through cash from operations
and borrowings from third parties. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash of approximately $43,143,000, an increase of $1,005,000 from our
cash balance of $42,138,000 as of October 1, 2022.
During the second quarter of our fiscal year 2021,
certain of the entities owning the limited partnership stores (the “LP’s”), as well as the store we manage but do not
own (the “Managed Store”) (collectively, the “Borrowers”), applied for and received loans from an unrelated third
party lender (the “Lender”) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) under the United States Coronavirus
Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) enacted March 27, 2020, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately
$3.98 million (the “2 nd
PPP Loans”), of which approximately: (i) $3.46 million was loaned to six (6) of the LP’s;
and (ii) $0.52 million was loaned to the Managed Store. During first quarter of our fiscal year 2022, we applied for forgiveness for all
PPP Loans, including the Managed Store, and as of December 31, 2022, the entire amount of principal and accrued interest was forgiven
under the 2 nd
PPP Loans.
Inflation is affecting all aspects of our operations, including but not limited to food, beverage, fuel and labor costs. Supply chain issues also contribute to inflation. Inflation, including supply chain issues are having
a material impact on our operating results.
Notwithstanding the negative effects of COVID-19 on
our operations, we believe that our current cash availability from our cash on hand, positive cash flow from operations and borrowed funds
will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.
Cash Flows

We did not declare or pay a cash dividend on our capital

dividends will be at our Board’s discretion and will depend upon our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements
and such other factors as our Board deems relevant.
21
Table of Contents
Capital Expenditures
In addition to using cash for our operating
expenses, we use cash generated from operations and borrowings to fund the development and construction of new restaurants and to
fund capitalized property improvements for our existing restaurants. During the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022, we acquired
property and equipment and construction in progress of $1,499,000, (of which $28,000 was purchase deposits transferred to property
and equipment and $37,000 was purchase deposits transferred to construction in process as of October 1, 2022), including $105,000
for renovations to two (2) existing limited partnership owned restaurants and $149,000 for renovations to two (2) Company owned
restaurants. During the thirteen weeks ended January 1, 2022, we acquired property and equipment and construction in progress of
$2,011,000, (of which $4,000 was deposits recorded in other assets and $140,000 was purchase deposits transferred to construction in
process as of October 2, 2021), including $587,000 for renovations to two (2) existing limited partnership owned restaurants and one
(1) Company owned restaurant.
We anticipate the cost of this refurbishment in our
fiscal year 2023 will be approximately $650,000, excluding construction/renovations to Store #19R (our restaurant which is being rebuilt
due to damages caused by a fire) and Store #24 (our Miramar, Florida package store location in development), although capital expenditures
for our refurbishing program for fiscal year 2023 may be significantly higher
Long Term Debt
As of December 31, 2022, we had long term debt
of $24,034,000, as compared to $25,389,000 as of October 1, 2022. Our long term debt decreased as of December 31, 2022 as compared to
October 1, 2022 because we paid off the balance of our term loan ($367,000) during the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022. In addition,
we did not finance our insurance premiums for our annual insurance renewal effective December 30, 2022.
In February 2023, we determined that as of December 31, 2022, we did not meet the required
Post-Distribution Basic Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the “Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant”) contained in each of our
six (6) loans (the “Institutional Loans”) with our unrelated third party institutional lender (the “Institutional Lender’).
The Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant requires we maintain a ratio of at least 1.15 to 1.00 and for the twelve (12) months ended
December 31, 2022 our ratio was calculated to be 1.13 to 1.00. On February 23, 2023, we received from the Institutional Lender, a written
waiver of the non-compliance with the Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant (the “Covenant Non-Compliance”), pursuant to
which, among other things, the Institutional Lender waived (1) the non-compliance as of December 31, 2022 and (2) their right to exercise
certain remedies under the Institutional Loans, including the right to accelerate the indebtedness owed by us thereunder, resulting in
the indebtedness under the Institutional Loans to be immediately due and payable, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
We believe we will regain compliance with the Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant as of the end of our second fiscal quarter of our
fiscal year ending September 30, 2023 and going forward. We have prepared projections for the next year, including estimated covenant
calculations for the next four (4) fiscal quarters and we expect to be in compliance. As a result, our classification of debt is appropriate
as of December 31, 2022.
For further information regarding the Company's long-term debt, refer to
the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended October
1, 2022.
Construction Contracts
(a) 7990 Davie Road Extension, Hollywood, Florida
(Store #19 – “Big Daddy’s Wine & Liquors”)
During the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019,
we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor for site work at this location totaling $1,618,000, (i)
to connect the real property where this restaurant operated (Store #19) to city sewer and (ii) to construct a new building on the adjacent
parcel of real property for the operation of a package liquor store. During our fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022, we agreed to change
orders to the agreement for additional construction services increasing the total contract price by $624,000 to $2,242,000 and subsequent
to the end of the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 we agreed to change orders to the agreement for additional construction services
increasing the total contract price by $71,000 to $2,313,000, of which $1,682,000 of the total amount obligated has been paid through
December 31, 2022 and an additional $400,000 has been paid subsequent to the end of the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 through
the date of filing of this quarterly report.
(b) 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19 –
“Flanigan’s”)
During the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019,
we entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party architect for design and development services totaling $77,000 for the re-build
of our restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19), which has been closed since October 2, 2018 due
to damages caused by a fire, of which $62,000 has been paid. During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022, we entered into an agreement
with a third party unaffiliated general contractor to re-build our restaurant at this location totaling $2,515,000, of which none has
been paid.

Table of Contents
(c) 14301 W. Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida

During the second
quarter of our fiscal year 2022, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor for exterior renovations
at this location totaling $343,000 and through our fiscal year 2023 we agreed to change orders to the agreement for additional interior
renovations increasing the total contract price by $74,000 to $417,000, of which $353,000 has been paid through December 31, 2022 and
$64,000 has been
paid subsequent to the end of the first quarter of our
fiscal year 2023 through the date of filing of this quarterly report.
(d) 11225 Miramar Parkway, #250, Miramar, Florida (“Flanigan’s”)
During the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022,
we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor for interior renovations at this location totaling $1,421,000,
and through the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 we agreed to change orders to the agreement increasing the total contract price
by $290,000 to $1,711,000 of which $1,159,000 has been paid through December 31, 2022 and $141,000, has been paid subsequent to the end
of the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 through the date of filing of this quarterly report.
(e) 11225 Miramar Parkway, #245, Miramar, Florida
(“Big Daddy’s Wine and Liquors”)
During the first quarter of our fiscal year
2022, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor for interior renovations at this location totaling
$317,000, and through the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 we agreed to change orders to the agreement increasing the total contract
price by $45,000 to $369,000 of which $316,000 has been paid through December 31, 2022 and $16,000 has been paid subsequent to the end
of the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 through the date of filing of this quarterly report.
Purchase Commitments
In order to fix the cost and ensure adequate
supply of baby back ribs for our restaurants for calendar year 2023, we entered into a purchase agreement with our current rib
supplier, whereby we agreed to purchase approximately $ 6.8 million of “2.25 & Down Baby Back Ribs” (industry jargon
for the weight range in which slabs of baby back ribs are sold) from this vendor during calendar year 2023, at a prescribed cost,
which we believe are competitive. The decrease in our cost of baby back ribs for calendar year 2023 compared to calendar year 2022
($10.4 million) is due to a decrease in market price.
While we anticipate purchasing all of our rib supply
from this vendor, we believe there are several other alternative vendors available, if needed.
Working Capital
The table below summarizes the current assets, current
liabilities, and working capital for our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022

Table of Contents
Our working capital decreased during our fiscal
quarter ended December 31, 2022 from our working capital for our fiscal year ended October 1, 2022 primarily due to increases in (i)
purchases of property and equipment; (ii) deposits on property and equipment; and (iii) deferred revenue; and decreases in prepaid
expenses.
While there can be no assurance due to, among other
things, unanticipated expenses or unanticipated decline in revenues, or both, we believe that our cash on hand, positive cash flow from
operations and borrowed funds will adequately fund operations, debt reductions and planned capital expenditures throughout our fiscal
year 2023.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies
See Item 7, page 51 of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended October 1, 2022 for a discussion of significant accounting policies.
Inflation
The
primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food, beverage and labor costs. A large number of restaurant personnel are paid
at rates based upon applicable minimum wage and increases in minimum wage directly affect labor costs.
Inflation is having a material
impact on our operating results, especially rising food, fuel and labor costs.
We
have endeavored to offset the adverse effects of cost increases by increasing our menu prices.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK.
We do not ordinarily hold market risk sensitive instruments
for trading purposes and as of December 31, 2022 held no equity securities.
Interest Rate Risk
As part of our ongoing operations, we are
exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings. As more fully described in Note 15 “Fair Value Measurements of
Financial Instruments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended October 1, 2022, we use interest rate swap
agreements to manage these risks. These instruments are not used for speculative purposes but are used to modify variable rate
obligations into fixed rate obligations. At December 31, 2022, we had one variable rate instrument outstanding that is impacted by
changes in interest rates.
24
Table of Contents
As a means of managing our interest rate risk on this
debt instrument, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with our unrelated third-party lender to convert this variable rate debt
obligation to a fixed rate. We are currently party to the following interest rate swap agreement:
(i)        The
interest rate swap agreement entered into in September 2022 relates to the $8.90M Loan (the “$8.90M Term Loan Swap”). The
$8.90M Term Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a fifteen (15) year period at a fixed rate of 4.90% on an initial amortizing notional
principal amount of $8,900,000, while receiving interest for the same period at BSBY Screen Rate – 1 Month, plus 1.50%, on the same
amortizing notional principal amount. We determined that at December 31, 2022, the interest rate swap agreement is an effective hedging
agreement and the fair value was not material.
At December 31, 2022, our cash resources offset our
bank charges and any excess cash resources earn interest at variable rates. Accordingly, our return on these funds is affected by fluctuations
in interest rates.
There is no assurance that interest rates will increase
or decrease over our next fiscal year or that an increase will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of December 31, 2022, an evaluation was
performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022.
Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting
A material weakness is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our interim or annual financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
During the course of our independent
registered public accounting firm performing its quarterly review procedures in connection with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements to be included in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of our 2023 fiscal year, we became aware of certain errors made by management
in recording certain transactions and in performing debt covenant calculations. As a result of these errors we have concluded that we
do not have a sufficient complement of trained and knowledgeable accounting personnel to prevent and detect errors on a timely basis and
that this deficiency constitutes a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.
We did not design or implement
additional controls during the thirteen weeks ended December 31, 2022 to address this material weakness, although during the thirteen
weeks ended December 31, 2022, we commenced a search to hire additional qualified accounting personnel with appropriate levels of knowledge,
experience and training.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During the thirteen weeks ended December 31,
2022, we have not made any change to our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. However, we are in the process of designing and planning
to enhance certain controls to address the material weakness discussed above. There is no assurance that this process will result
in remediation of the material weakness or prevent other material weaknesses from arising in the future.
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
