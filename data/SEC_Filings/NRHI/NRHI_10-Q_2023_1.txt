NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JANUARY 31, 2023   NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS   Natural Resource Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada on April 19, 2016. We were a development stage company that intended to develop an online beauty sample subscription service.
On November 26, 2020, the Company completed an acquisition of working interests in certain mining properties. The mining property right was fully impaired during the year ended April 30, 2022.   On October 18, 2022, majority of the Company’s shareholders approved a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a basis of up to twenty (20) old shares for one (1) new share of common stock. The reverse stock split was approved by FINRA for approval on February 21, 2023. The financial statements retroactively reflect the reverse stock split.   On January 8, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with a surveying consulting firm for mining and mineral exploration and surveying services on Potter County, PA Utica Shale area oil and gas properties.
On February 14, 2023, the Company’s name changed to Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. and the Company trading symbol will change to “NRHI” effective 20 business days from February 21, 2023.   We are currently focusing on mining business.   NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation   The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending April 30, 2023. Notes to the unaudited interim financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for fiscal year 2022 have been omitted. This report should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the footnotes thereto for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022 included in the Company’s Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 10, 2022.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.     7 Table of Contents   These tiers include:   Level 1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3: defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.   The carrying value of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accrued interest, current portion of long-term debt, other party loan and loan from director approximates its fair value due to their short-term maturity.    Mining Property
Costs of lease, exploration, carrying and retaining unproven mineral properties are expensed as incurred. The Company expenses all mineral exploration costs as incurred as it is still in the exploration stage. If the Company identifies proven and probable reserves in its investigation of its properties and upon development of a plan for operating a mine, it would enter the development stage and capitalize future costs until production is established. When a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs are amortized on a units-of-production basis over the proven and probable reserves following the commencement of production. Interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to construct new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use.   To date, the Company has not established the commercial feasibility of any exploration prospects; therefore, all exploration costs are being expensed.   ASC 930-805, “Extractive Activities-Mining: Business Combinations” states that mineral rights consist of the legal right to explore, extract, and retain at least a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include mineral rights which are considered tangible assets under ASC 930-805. ASC 930-805 requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. As a result, the direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral rights include costs associated with acquiring patented and unpatented mining claims.   ASC 930-805 provides that in measuring the fair value of mineral assets, an acquirer should take into account both:   (a) The value beyond proven and probable reserves (“VBPP”) to the extent that a market participant would include VBPP in determining the fair value of the assets.   (b) The effects of anticipated fluctuations in the future market price of minerals in a manner that is consistent with the expectations of market participants.   During the nine months ended, the Company incurred mining exploration expense of $2,833 for surveying services on Potter County, PA Utica Shale area oil and gas properties performed in January 2023.   Prepaid Expense   Prepaid expense relates to prepayment for surveying services on Potter County, PA Utica Shale area oil and gas properties performed in February 2023.   Revenue Recognition   The Company recognized revenue from the sales of mineral products produced from mining operations in accordance with ASC 606,”Revenue Recognition” following the five steps procedure:   Step 1: The contract has been signed by both parties or when the invoice has been generated and provided to the customer Step 2: The performance obligations are stated or implied in the contract or invoice Step 3: The transaction price has been identified in the contract or invoice Step 4: The Company has allocated the transaction price to the performance obligations pursuant to the contract or invoice Step 5: The Company satisfied the performance obligations when the mineral products delivered to the purchaser
8 Table of Contents   The Company recognized revenue from the royalty revenue in accordance with ASC 606,”Revenue Recognition” following the five steps procedure:   Step 1: The contract has been signed by both parties for royalty fees Step 2: The performance obligations are stated or implied in the contract Step 3: The transaction price has been identified in the contract Step 4: The Company has allocated the transaction price to the performance obligations pursuant to the contract Step 5: The Company has satisfied the performance obligations at the same period as the sales that generate the royalty payment    Inherent in the fair value calculation of an ARO are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the mining property balance. Settlements greater than or less than amounts accrued as ARO are recorded as a gain or loss upon settlement.   Income Tax   Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is established when management considers it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.   Tax benefits from an uncertain tax position are only recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as incurred as a component of income tax expense. The Company has not recognized any tax benefits from uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented.
The Company has not filed income tax returns from year ended April 30, 2016 through April 30, 2020. $ 25,000  annual late tax filing interest and penalty was accrued for an aggregate amount of $ 125,000 .   Related Party Balances and Transactions   The Company follows FASB ASC 850, “Related Party Disclosures,” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transaction. (Note 4)   Basic and Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share   The Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, “Earnings per Share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
9 Table of Contents   As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, convertible notes were dilutive instruments and were not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share as their effect would be antidilutive:       January 31,     January 31,       2023     2022       (Shares)     (Shares)   Convertible note payable     598,659       -     As of January 31, 2023, the total convertible shares from convertible notes totaling $ 199,565

Recent accounting pronouncements   In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance will be effective for entities for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.   In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 “Debt-Debt with “Conversion and Other Options” and ASC subtopic 815-40 “Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity”. The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and, (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. ASU2020-06 removes from U.S. GAAP the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a cash conversion feature (“CCF”) and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”). With the adoption of ASU2020-06, entities will not separately present in equity an embedded conversion feature these debts. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has chosen to early adopt this standard on its year ended April 30, 2022 financial statements and did not record BCF on the issuance of convertible notes with conversion rate below the Company’s market stock price on the date of note issuance.   Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. The Company’s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.   NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN   The Company’s financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.   As reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 409,536 , and working capital deficit of $ 176,198
at January 31, 2023.   The Company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support the Company’s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering.     10 Table of Contents   The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   NOTE 4 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   On July 1, 2021, the Company issued a promissory note of $ 153,913
to the Company’s director for previous operating expenses of $ 28,913
and acquisition of mining interest of $ 125,000
which were paid by the director on the Company’s behalf as of April 30, 2021. The note is unsecured with annual interest rate of
2 % and has a mature date of
December 31, 2022 .   In December 2020, the Company acquired several gold mining claims in Canada. The Company planned for exploration on the properties. Due to Covid and economic downturn , the Company was unable to proceed with the mining property exploration. Upon the expiration of the two years term of the property mining rights, the Company decided not to extend beyond the original term of the mining rights and was fully impaired during year ended April 30, 2022.   On July 31, 2021, the Company issued a promissory note of $ 2,822
for the amount the related party paid to the vendors on behalf of the Company during the three months ended July 31, 2021. The note is unsecured with annual interest rate of
2 % and has a mature date of
December 31, 2022 .   On October 31, 2021, the Company issued a promissory note of $ 11,450
for the amount the related party paid to the vendors on behalf of the Company during the three months ended October 31, 2021. The note is unsecured with annual interest rate of 2 % and has a mature date of
December 31, 2022 .   On January 31, 2022, the Company issued a promissory note of $ 7,021
for the amount the related party paid to the vendors on behalf of the Company during the three months ended January 31, 2022. The note is unsecured with annual interest rate of
2 % and has a mature date of
December 31, 2022 .   On February 4, 2022, the Company’s director sold the promissory notes with aggregate principal of $ 175,206
and accrued interest of $ 1,956
to an unaffiliated party. (Note 5)   NOTE 5 – CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE   As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the convertible note payable was shown as follows:           January 31,     April 30,       Expiry Date   2023     2022   Convertible Note - February 2022   12/31/2025   $ 175,206     $ 175,206   Convertible Note - April 2022   12/31/2025     2,500       2,500   Convertible Note - July 2022   12/31/2025     7,600       -   Convertible Note - October 2022   12/31/2025     11,725       -   Convertible Note - January 2023   12/31/2025     12,500                     209,531       177,706   Less debt discount         ( 9,966 )     ( 12,549 )         $ 199,565     $ 165,157     On February 11, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with the unaffiliated note holder of the promissory note of $ 175,206
sold to him on February 4, 2022 for the amendment of the promissory note to convertible note which bears annual interest rate of 2%, has a maturity date of
December 31, 2025
and is convertible at $ 0.35
per share for the Company common stock. With the adoption of ASU2020-06, the Company did not record beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”) on the convertible note.

We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management’s best judgment as to what may occur in the future.

On November 26, 2020, the Company completed an acquisition of working interests in certain mining properties. The mining property right was fully impaired during the year ended April 30, 2022. On January 8, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with a surveying consulting firm for mining and mineral exploration and surveying services on Potter County, PA Utica Shale area oil and gas properties. On February 14, 2023, the Company’s name changed to Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. We are currently focusing on mining business.   EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS   At present, we have no employees other than our officer and director. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers, directors or employees.   Results of Operations   We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.   We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.   The following summary of our operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed financial statements for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, which are included herein.   Three Months Ended January 31, 2023 and 2022       Three Months Ended                   January 31,     Changes       2023     2022     Amount     %                             Operating Expenses   $ (8,793 )   $ (5,297 )   $ (3,496 )     66 % Other Income (Expenses)     (1,974 )     (979 )     (995 )     102 % Net Loss

Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering.   The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   Plan of Operation and Funding   We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.   Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of software; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.     15 Table of Contents   Contractual Obligations   As a “smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.   Critical Accounting Policies   The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.   Mining Property
Costs of lease, exploration, carrying and retaining unproven mineral properties are expensed as incurred. The Company expenses all mineral exploration costs as incurred as it is still in the exploration stage. If the Company identifies proven and probable reserves in its investigation of its properties and upon development of a plan for operating a mine, it would enter the development stage and capitalize future costs until production is established. When a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs are amortized on a units-of-production basis over the proven and probable reserves following the commencement of production. Interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to construct new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use.   To date, the Company has not established the commercial feasibility of any exploration prospects; therefore, all exploration costs are being expensed.   ASC 930-805, “Extractive Activities-Mining: Business Combinations” states that mineral rights consist of the legal right to explore, extract, and retain at least a portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include mineral rights which are considered tangible assets under ASC 930-805. ASC 930-805 requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. As a result, the direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral rights include costs associated with acquiring patented and unpatented mining claims.   ASC 930-805 provides that in measuring the fair value of mineral assets, an acquirer should take into account both:   (a) The value beyond proven and probable reserves (“VBPP”) to the extent that a market participant would include VBPP in determining the fair value of the assets.   (b) The effects of anticipated fluctuations in the future market price of minerals in a manner that is consistent with the expectations of market participants.     16 Table of Contents   Revenue Recognition   The Company recognized revenue from the sales of mineral products produced from mining operations in accordance with ASC 606,” Revenue Recognition ” following the five steps procedure:   Step 1: The contract has been signed by both parties or when the invoice has been generated and provided to the customer Step 2: The performance obligations are stated or implied in the contract or invoice Step 3: The transaction price has been identified in the contract or invoice Step 4: The Company has allocated the transaction price to the performance obligations pursuant to the contract or invoice Step 5: The Company satisfied the performance obligations when the mineral products delivered to the purchaser
