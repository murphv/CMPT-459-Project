(this “Quarterly Report”) that are not statements of historical or current facts, such as those under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from historical results or from any future results or projections expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In addition to statements that explicitly describe such risks and uncertainties, readers are urged to consider statements in conditional or future tenses or that include terms such as “believes,” “belief,” “expects,” “estimates,” “intends,” “anticipates” or “plans” to be uncertain and forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may include comments as to our beliefs and expectations regarding future events and trends affecting our business and are necessarily subject to uncertainties, many of which are outside our control. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to:
• the impact of the continuing financial and operational uncertainty due to the coronavirus pandemic and/or other pandemics, associated supply chain disruptions and inflation;
• global economic and political instability and conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, including issues such as rising inflation and global supply-chain disruption;
• competition which could limit our ability to maintain or expand market share within our industry; • continued consolidation in the healthcare industry; • potential delays in recognizing or increasing revenue if the sales cycle or implementation period takes longer than expected; • the impact to our business if members of our group purchasing organization (“GPO”) programs reduce activity levels or terminate or elect not to renew their contracts on substantially similar terms or at all; • the rate at which the markets for our software as a service (“SaaS”) or licensed-based clinical analytics products and services develop; • the dependency of our members on payments from third-party payors; • our reliance on administrative fees that we receive from GPO suppliers; • our ability to maintain third-party provider and strategic alliances and/or enter into new alliances; • our ability to timely offer new and innovative products and services; • the portion of our revenues that we receive from our largest members; • risks and expenses related to future acquisition opportunities and/or integration of previous or future acquisitions; • financial and operational risks associated with non-controlling investments in other businesses or other joint ventures that we do not control, particularly early-stage companies; • pending and potential litigation; • our reliance on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers and other third parties and our own systems for providing services to our users; • data loss or corruption due to failures or errors in our systems, service disruptions at our data centers, and/or breaches or failures of our security measures; • the financial, operational and reputational consequences of cyber-attacks or other data security breaches that disrupt our operations and/or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our members or other third parties; • our ability to use, disclose, de-identify or license data and/or effectively integrate third-party technologies; • our use of “open source” software; 4 • our dependency on contract manufacturing facilities located in various parts of the world; • inventory risk we face in the event of a potential material decline in demand or price for the personal protective equipment or other products we may have purchased at elevated market prices or fixed prices; • our ability to attract, hire, integrate and retain key personnel; • adequate protection of our intellectual property and potential claims against our use of the intellectual property of third parties; • potential sales and use tax liability in certain jurisdictions; • changes in tax laws that materially impact our tax rate, income tax expense, anticipated tax benefits, deferred tax assets, cash flows and profitability; • our indebtedness and our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, including our ability to renew or replace our existing long-term credit facility at maturity; • fluctuation of our quarterly cash flows, revenues and results of operations; • changes and uncertainty in the political, economic or regulatory environment affecting healthcare organizations, including with respect to the status of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and pandemic-related public health and reimbursement measures;
• our compliance with complex international, federal and state laws, rules and regulations governing financial relationships among healthcare providers and the submission of false or fraudulent healthcare claims; • interpretation and enforcement of current or future antitrust laws and regulations; • compliance with complex federal, state and international privacy, security and breach notification laws; • compliance with current or future laws, rules or regulations relating to information blocking provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act issued by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (the “ONC Rules”) that may cause our certified Health Information Technology products to be regulated by the ONC Rules; • compliance with current or future laws, rules and regulations adopted by the Food and Drug Administration applicable to our software applications that may be considered medical devices; • the impact of payments required under notes payable to former limited partners related to the early termination of the Unit Exchange and Tax Receivable Acceleration Agreements (the “Unit Exchange Agreements”) issued in connection with our August 2020 Restructuring (as defined below) on our overall cash flow and our ability to fully realize the expected tax benefits to match such fixed payment obligations under those notes payable; • provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Delaware law and other applicable laws that discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of us; • failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting and/or an inability to remediate any weaknesses identified and the related costs of remediation; • the impact on the price of our Class A common stock if we cease paying dividends or reduce dividend payments from current levels; • the number of shares of Class A common stock repurchased by us pursuant to any then-existing Class A common stock repurchase program and the timing of any such repurchases;

Principles of Consolidation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercised control and when applicable, entities for which the Company had a controlling financial interest or was the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Accordingly, certain information and disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of results of operations and financial condition for the interim periods shown, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, unless otherwise disclosed. The Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes contained in the 2022 Annual Report. 13 Supplementary Cash Flows Information The following table presents supplementary cash flows information for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Supplemental schedule of non-cash investing and financing activities: Increase in treasury stock related to a payable as a result of applying trade date accounting when recording the repurchase of Class A common stock $ —   $ 2,108   Non-cash additions to property and equipment 84   8   Accrued dividend equivalents 519   244   Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements The preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis, including, but not limited to, estimates for net administrative fees revenue, software licenses, other services and support revenue, contract assets, deferred revenue, contract costs, allowances for credit losses, reserves for net realizable value of inventory, obsolete inventory, useful lives of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, deferred tax balances including valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, uncertain tax positions, values of investments not publicly traded, projected future cash flows used in the evaluation of asset impairments, values of call rights, values of earn-out liabilities and the allocation of purchase prices. These estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
There have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies as described in the 2022 Annual Report. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2021-08 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, (“ASU 2021-08”), which requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements nor its related disclosures. (3) BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS Acquisition of TRPN Direct Pay, Inc. and Devon Health, Inc. Assets On October 13, 2022, the Company, through its consolidated subsidiary Contigo Health, LLC (“Contigo Health”), acquired certain assets (the “TRPN Transferred Assets”) of TRPN Direct Pay, Inc. and Devon Health, Inc. (collectively, “TRPN”), including contracts with more than
900,000
providers (collectively, the “Assumed Contracts”), and agreed to assume certain liabilities and obligations of TRPN with regard to the Assumed Contracts (referred to as the “TRPN acquisition”). The TRPN Transferred Assets relate to businesses of TRPN focused on improving access to quality healthcare and reducing the cost of medical claims through pre-negotiated discounts with network providers, including acute-care hospitals, surgery centers, physicians, and other non-acute providers in the United States. Contigo Health also agreed to license proprietary cost containment technology of TRPN.
The purchase price paid by the Company to complete the TRPN acquisition consisted of cash of $ 177.5
million, funded with borrowings under the Company’s Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8 - Debt and Notes Payable) and cash on hand, of which $ 17.8
million was placed in escrow to satisfy indemnification obligations of TRPN to Contigo Health and its affiliates and other parties related thereto under the purchase agreement governing the TRPN acquisition (“TRPN Purchase Agreement”). The Company has accounted for the TRPN acquisition as a business combination whereby the purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The total fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired was $ 116.6
million, consisting primarily of the provider network.
14 The TRPN acquisition resulted in the recognition of $ 60.9
million of goodwill attributable to the anticipated profitability of TRPN, based on the purchase price paid in the acquisition compared to the fair value of the net assets acquired. The TRPN acquisition was considered an asset acquisition for income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Company expects tax goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes. The initial purchase price allocation for the TRPN acquisition is preliminary and subject to changes in the valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. TRPN is being integrated within Premier under Contigo Health and is reported as part of the Performance Services Segment. Pro forma results of operations for the acquisition have not been presented because the effects on revenue and net income were not material to the Company’s historical consolidated financial statements. (4) INVESTMENTS

15 (5) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Recurring Fair Value Measurements The following table represents the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands): Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs
(Level 3) December 31, 2022 Cash equivalents $ 76   $ 76   $ —   $ —   Deferred compensation plan assets 49,475   49,475   —   —   Total assets 49,551   49,551   —   —   Earn-out liabilities 24,098   —   —   24,098   Total liabilities $ 24,098   $ —   $ —   $ 24,098   June 30, 2022 Cash equivalents $ 75   $ 75   $ —   $ —   Deferred compensation plan assets 52,718   52,718   —   —   Total assets 52,793   52,793   —   —   Earn-out liabilities 22,789   —   —   22,789   Total liabilities $ 22,789   $ —   $ —   $ 22,789   Deferred compensation plan assets consisted of highly liquid mutual fund investments, which were classified as Level 1. The current portion of deferred compensation plan assets ($ 4.9
million and $ 5.3
million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively) was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) FFF Put and Call Rights
On July 29, 2021, the FFF shareholders’ agreement was amended resulting in the termination of the FFF Put Right and the derecognition of the FFF Put Right liability.
In the event of a Key Man Event (generally defined in the FFF shareholders’ agreement as the resignation, termination for cause, death or disability of the majority shareholder), the Company has a call right that requires the majority shareholder to sell its remaining interest in FFF to the Company, and is exercisable at any time within
180
calendar days after the date of a Key Man Event (the “Call Right”, together with the FFF Put Right, the “Put and Call Rights”). As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Call Right had
zero
value. In the event that the Call Right is exercised, the purchase price for the additional interest in FFF will be at a per share price equal to FFF’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“FFF EBITDA”) over the twelve calendar months prior to the purchase date multiplied by a market adjusted multiple, adjusted for any outstanding debt and cash and cash equivalents, divided by the number of shares of FFF common stock then outstanding (“Equity Value per Share”). Earn-out liabilities
An earn-out liability was established in connection with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Acurity, Inc. and Nexera, Inc. (the “Acurity and Nexera asset acquisition”) in February 2020 based upon the Company’s achievement of a range of member renewals on terms to be agreed to by the Company and Greater New York Hospital Association based on prevailing market conditions in December 2023. The earn-out liability is classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The earn-out liability arising from expected earn-out payments related to the Acurity and Nexera asset acquisition was measured on the acquisition date using a probability-weighted expected payment model and is remeasured periodically due to changes in management’s estimates of the number of transferred member renewals and market conditions. In determining the
16 fair value of the contingent liabilities, management reviews the current results of the acquired business, along with projected results for the remaining earn-out period, to calculate the expected earn-out payment to be made based on the contractual terms set out in the acquisition agreement. The Acurity and Nexera earn-out liability utilized a credit spread of
1.4 % at December 31, 2022 and
1.6 % at June 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the undiscounted range of outcomes is between $ 0
and $ 30.0
million. A significant decrease in the probability could result in a significant decrease in the value of the earn-out liability. The fair value of the Acurity and Nexera earn-out liability at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 was $ 22.6
million and $ 22.8
million, respectively. Acurity and Nexera Earn-out

(b) A gain on level 3 liability balances will decrease the liability ending balance whereas a loss on level 3 liability balance will increase the liability ending balance.
Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements As a result of the August 2020 Restructuring, the Company recorded non-interest bearing notes payable to former limited partners during the three months ended September 30, 2020. Although these notes are non-interest bearing, they include a Level 2 input associated with an implied fixed annual interest rate of
1.8 % (see Note 8 - Debt and Notes Payable). As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the notes payable to former limited partners were recorded net of discounts of $ 6.4
million and $ 9.1
million, respectively. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, no non-recurring fair value measurements were required relating to the measurement of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. However, purchase price allocations required significant non- 17 recurring Level 3 inputs. The preliminary fair values of the acquired intangible assets resulting from the TRPN acquisition were determined using the income approach (see Note 3 - Business Acquisitions). Financial Instruments For Which Fair Value Only is Disclosed The fair values of non-interest bearing notes payable, classified as Level 2, were equal to the carrying value at December 31, 2022 and $ 0.1
million less than the carrying value at June 30, 2022 based on an assumed market interest rate of
1.6 %. Other Financial Instruments The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and the Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8 - Debt and Notes Payable) approximated carrying value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
(6) CONTRACT BALANCES Deferred Revenue Revenue recognized during the six months ended December 31, 2022 that was included in the opening balance of deferred revenue at June 30, 2022 was $ 23.3
million, which is a result of satisfying certain performance obligations.
Performance Obligations
A performance obligation is a contractual obligation to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Contracts may have a single performance obligation as the agreement to transfer individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other contractual obligations and, therefore, not distinct, while other contracts may have multiple performance obligations, most commonly due to the contract covering multiple phases or deliverable arrangements (licensing fees, SaaS subscription fees, maintenance and support fees, and professional fees for consulting services). Refer to the Company’s significant accounting policies in the 2022 Annual Report for discussion of revenue recognition on contracts with customers.
The reduction to net revenue recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2022 from performance obligations that were satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods was $ 0.4
million. The reduction was driven by a $ 0.8
million decrease associated with revised forecasts from underlying contracts that include variable consideration components as well as additional fluctuations due to input method contracts which occur in the normal course of business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $ 0.4
million in net administrative fees revenue related to under-forecasted cash receipts received in the current period. Net revenue of $ 2.5
million was recognized during the six months ended December 31, 2022 from performance obligations that were satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods. The net revenue recognized was driven by an increase of $ 4.6
million in net administrative fees revenue related to under-forecasted cash receipts received in the current period partially offset by a reduction of $ 2.1
million associated with revised forecasts from underlying contracts that include variable consideration components as well as additional fluctuations due to input method contracts which occur in the normal course of business.
Net revenue of $ 8.1
million and $ 3.7
million was recognized during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively, from certain performance obligations that were satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods. The net revenue recognized was driven by an increase of $ 7.3
million and $ 3.1
million, respectively, in net administrative fees revenue related to under-forecasted cash receipts received in the current period. There was also an increase of $ 0.8
million and $ 0.6
million, respectively, associated with revised forecasts from underlying contracts that include variable consideration components as well as additional fluctuations due to input method contracts which occur in the normal course of business. Remaining performance obligations represent the portion of the transaction price that has not yet been satisfied or achieved. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $ 700.6
million. The Company expects to recognize approximately
42 % of the remaining performance obligations over the next
12
months and an additional
23 % over the following
12
months, with the remainder recognized thereafter. 18 (7) GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill Goodwill consisted of the following (in thousands): Supply Chain Services Performance Services Total June 30, 2022 $ 388,502   $ 611,411   $ 999,913   Acquisition of businesses and assets —   69,387   69,387   December 31, 2022 $ 388,502   $ 680,798   $ 1,069,300   Goodwill increased primarily due to the TRPN acquisition (see Note 3 - Business Acquisitions).

The Credit Facility has a maturity date of December 12, 2027, subject to up to
two
one-year
extensions at the request of the Co-Borrowers and approval of a majority of the lenders under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $ 1.0
billion with (i) a $ 50.0
million sub-facility for standby letters of credit and (ii) a $ 100.0
million sub-facility for swingline loans. The Credit Facility also provides that Co-Borrowers may from time to time (i) incur incremental term loans and (ii) request an increase in the revolving commitments under the Credit Facility, together up to an aggregate of $ 350.0
million, subject to the approval of the lenders providing such term loans or revolving commitment increase. The Credit Facility contains an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty of all obligations of Co-Borrowers under the Credit Facility by the current and future Guarantors. Premier is not a guarantor under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility refinanced the Credit Facility dated November 9, 2018, as amended (the “Prior Loan Agreement”), and the Prior Loan Agreement, which was scheduled to mature on November 9, 2023, was terminated on December 12, 2022. The Prior Loan Agreement included a $ 1.0
billion unsecured revolving credit facility. At the time of its termination, outstanding borrowings, accrued interest and fees and expenses under the Prior Loan Agreement totaled $ 331.3
million, which was repaid with cash on hand and borrowings under the new Credit Facility. At the Company’s option, committed loans under the Credit Facility may be in the form of secured overnight financing rate loans (“SOFR Loans”) or base rate loans. SOFR Loans bear interest at SOFR plus an adjustment of
0.100 % (“Adjusted Term SOFR”) plus the Applicable Rate (defined as a margin based on the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility)). Base rate loans bear interest at the Base Rate (defined as the highest of the prime rate announced by the administrative agent, the federal funds effective rate plus
0.500 %, the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus
1.000 %, and
0.000 %), plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate ranges from
1.250 % to
1.750 % for SOFR Loans and
0.250 % to
0.750 % for base rate loans. At December 31, 2022 , the interest rate for SOFR Loans was
5.708 % and the interest rate for base rate loans was
7.750 %. Co-Borrowers are required to pay a commitment fee ranging from
0.125 % to
0.225 % per annum on the actual daily unused amount of commitments under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2022, the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility was
5.633 % and the annual commitment fee, based on the actual daily unused amount of commitments under the Credit Facility, was
0.125 %.
The Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, limitations on liens, indebtedness, fundamental changes, dispositions, restricted payments and investments. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants at December 31, 2022. The Credit Facility also contains
20 customary events of default, including a cross-default of any indebtedness or guarantees in excess of $ 75.0
million. If any event of default occurs and is continuing, the administrative agent under the Credit Facility may, with the consent, or shall, at the request of a majority of the lenders under the Credit Facility, terminate the commitments and declare all of the amounts owed under the Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable.
The Company had $ 300.0
million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2022 with $ 699.9
million of available borrowing capacity after reductions for outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company borrowed $ 285.0  million and repaid $ 135.0
million of outstanding borrowings under the Prior Loan Agreement. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, there were
no
borrowings or repayments under the Credit Facility. In January 2023, the Company repaid $ 30.0
million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. Notes Payable Notes Payable to Former Limited Partners At December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 250.3
million of notes payable to former LPs, net of discounts on notes payable of $ 6.4
million, of which $ 98.7
million was recorded to current portion of notes payable to former limited partners in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. At June 30, 2022, the Company had $ 299.0
million of notes payable to former LPs, net of discounts on notes payable of $ 9.1
million, of which $ 97.8

The notes payable to former LPs were issued in connection with the early termination of the TRA as part of the August 2020 Restructuring. Although the notes payable to former LPs are non-interest bearing, pursuant to GAAP requirements, they were recorded net of imputed interest at a fixed annual rate of
1.8 %.
Other At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had $ 3.0
million and $ 5.3

118,866,586
shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $ 0.01
per share, outstanding. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid cash dividends of $ 0.21
per share on outstanding shares of Class A common stock to stockholders on each of September 15, 2022 and December 15, 2022. On January 26, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.21
per share, payable on March 15, 2023 to stockholders of record on March 1, 2023. (10) EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Except when the effect would be anti-dilutive, the diluted earnings per share calculation, which is calculated using the treasury stock method, includes the impact of all potentially issuable dilutive shares of Class A common stock.

0.2
million and
0.3
million performance share awards, respectively, was excluded from diluted weighted average shares outstanding as the awards had not satisfied the applicable performance criteria at the end of the period.
For the six months ended December 31, 2021, the effect of

million and $ 6.4
million, respectively, which reflects effective tax rates of
27 % and
8 %, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 is primarily driven by the prior year valuation allowance release resulting from the Subsidiary Reorganization. Excluding the valuation allowance release, the effective tax rate would have been 19% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 with the remaining difference primarily related to repricing due to the Subsidiary Reorganization and state legislative changes. Income tax expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 42.5
million and $ 25.4
million, respectively, which reflects effective tax rates of
28 % and
11 %, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022, is primarily driven by the prior year valuation allowance release resulting from the Subsidiary Reorganization. Excluding the valuation allowance release, the effective tax rate would have been 24% for the six months ended December 31, 2021 with the remaining difference primarily related to repricing due to the Subsidiary Reorganization and state legislative changes.

The Company uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA (a financial measure not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“Non-GAAP”)) as its primary measure of profit or loss to assess segment performance and to determine the allocation of resources. The Company also uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate the comparison of the segment operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period. The Company defines Segment Adjusted EBITDA as the segment’s net revenue less cost of revenue and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment excluding depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangible assets, merger and acquisition-related expenses, and non-recurring or non-cash items, and including equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates. Operating expenses directly attributable to the segment include expenses associated with sales and marketing, general and administrative, and product development activities specific to the operation of each segment. General and administrative corporate expenses that are not specific to a particular segment are not included in the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA also excludes any income and expense that has been classified as discontinued operations.

Trends in the U.S. healthcare market affect our revenues and costs in the Supply Chain Services and Performance Services segments. The trends we see affecting our current healthcare business include the impact of inflation on the broader economy and the significant increase to input costs in healthcare, including the rising cost of labor, as well as the impact of the implementation of current or future healthcare legislation, particularly any material alterations to the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). Actions related to the ACA could be disruptive for Premier and our customers, impacting revenue, reporting requirements, payment reforms, shift in care to the alternate site market and increased data availability and transparency. To meet the demands of this environment, there will be increased focus on scale and cost containment and healthcare providers will need to measure and report on and bear financial risk for outcomes. Over the long-term, we believe these trends will result in increased demand for our Supply Chain Services and Performance Services solutions in the areas of cost management, quality and safety, and value-based care; however, there are uncertainties and risks that may affect the actual impact of these anticipated trends, expected demand for our services or related assumptions on our business. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for more information. COVID-19 Pandemic, Variants Thereof, Recurrences or Similar Pandemics
In addition to the trends in the U.S. healthcare market discussed above, we face known and unknown uncertainties arising from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and the resulting global pandemic and financial and operational uncertainty, including its impact on the overall economy, our sales, operations and supply chains, our members and other customers, workforce and suppliers, and countries. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, variants thereof, and potential future pandemic outbreaks, we face significant risks including, but not limited to:
• Overall economic and capital markets decline.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and variants thereof and associated supply chain disruptions could result in a prolonged recession or depression in the United States or globally that could harm the banking system, limit demand for many products and services and cause other foreseen and unforeseen events and circumstances, all of which could negatively impact us. The continued spread of COVID-19 and variants thereof has led to and could continue to lead to severe disruption and volatility in the United States and global capital markets, which could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets in the future. In addition, trading prices on the public stock market, as well as that of our Class A common stock, have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. • Changes in the demand for our products and services.
We experienced and may continue to experience demand uncertainty from both material increases and decreases in demand and pricing for our products and services as our members continue to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a material increase in demand for personal protective equipment (“PPE”), drugs and other supplies directly related to treating and preventing the
30 spread of COVID-19 and variants thereof during fiscal 2020 and 2021. In the second half of fiscal 2022 through the current period of fiscal 2023, demand and pricing for PPE, drugs and other supplies decreased due to members’ excess inventory levels resulting in a decline in revenue relative to the previous two fiscal years. Patients, hospitals and other medical facilities may continue to defer some elective procedures and routine medical visits due to ongoing and continuing uncertainty from COVID-19 outbreaks or variants thereof, or as a result of restrictive government orders or advisories. While demand for many supplies and services not related to COVID-19 may continue to decline in fiscal 2023, rolling shortages of products and drugs needed for routine procedures, such as contrast media and flush syringes, could have an impact on demand for hospital services and the financial conditions of providers, particularly those forced to procure such products through resellers.
• Increased labor costs.
Labor shortages and the resulting increases to the cost of labor are an ongoing challenge to the healthcare providers we serve. Limited availability of staff resources and rolling staff shortages may continue to impair the ability of existing staff to manage product and service procurement. While our non-acute and non-healthcare businesses, such as education and hospitality customers, experienced a rebound in fiscal 2022, the recovery may be hampered by future COVID-19 outbreaks or variants, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.
• Limited access to our members’ facilities that impacts our ability to fulfill our contractual requirements.
While some of our hospital customers have allowed increased access to their facilities by non-patients, including our field teams, consultants and other professionals, there are many that still are not permitting onsite access outside of their staff. Hospital imposed travel restrictions are also impacting some customers’ ability to participate in face-to-face events with us, such as committee meetings and conferences, which limits our ability to build on customer relationships. The long-term continuation, or any future recurrence of these circumstances, may negatively impact the ability of our employees to effectively deliver existing or sell new products and services to our members and could negatively affect the performance of our existing contracts. • Materials and personnel shortages and disruptions in supply chain, including manufacturing and shipping.
The global supply chain has been materially disrupted due to personnel shortages associated with ongoing COVID-19 rates of infection, stay-at-home orders, rapidly escalating shipping costs, raw material availability, material logistical delays due to port congestion and general labor constraints. Stay-at-home orders and other restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in China, have impacted and continue to impact our access to products for our members. Staffing or personnel shortages due to stay-at-home orders and quarantines, or other public health measures, have impacted and, in the future, may impact us and our members, other customers or suppliers. In addition, due to unprecedented demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been widespread shortages in certain product categories. If the supply chain for materials used in the products purchased by our members through our GPO or products contract manufactured through our direct sourcing business continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, our supply chain may continue to be disrupted. Failure of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors and other business partners to meet their obligations to our members, other customers or to us, or material disruptions in their ability to do so due to their own financial or operational difficulties, may adversely impact our operations. • Requests for contract modifications, payment deferrals or exercises of force majeure clauses.
We have and may continue to receive requests for contract modifications, payment waivers and deferrals, payment reductions or amended payment terms from our contract counterparties. We have and may continue to receive requests to delay service or payment on performance service contracts. In addition, we have and may continue to receive requests from our suppliers for increases to their contracted prices, and such requests may be implemented in the future. Inflation in such contract prices may impact member utilization of items and services available through our GPO contracts, which could adversely impact our net administrative fees revenue and direct sourcing revenue. In addition, several pharmacy suppliers have exercised force majeure clauses related to failure to supply clauses in their contracts with us because they are unable to obtain raw materials for manufacturing from India and China. The standard failure to supply language in our contracts contains financial penalties to suppliers if they are unable to supply products, which such suppliers may not be able to pay. In addition, we may not be able to source products from alternative suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. • Managing the evolving regulatory environment.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and variants thereof, federal, state and local governments are issuing new rules, regulations, orders and advisories and changing reimbursement eligibility rules on a regular basis. These government actions can impact us and our members, other customers and suppliers. 31 The ultimate impact of COVID-19, variants thereof, recurrences, or similar pandemics on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments, including the duration of any pandemic and the related length of its impact on the United States and global economies, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, variants thereof, recurrences, or future similar pandemics may also exacerbate many of the other risks described in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” section of the 2022 Annual Report. Despite our efforts to manage these impacts, their ultimate impact depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any outbreak and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. The foregoing and other continued disruptions in our business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, variants thereof, recurrences or similar pandemics could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects and the trading prices of our securities in the near-term and through fiscal 2023 and beyond. Russia-Ukraine War In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine which resulted in sanctions, export controls and other measures imposed against Russia, Belarus and specific areas within Ukraine. As the war endures, it continues to affect the global economy and financial markets, as well as exacerbating ongoing economic challenges, including issues such as rising inflation, energy costs and global supply-chain disruption. We continue to monitor the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war on macroeconomic conditions and prepare for any implications that the war may have on member demand, our suppliers’ ability to deliver products, cybersecurity risks and our liquidity and access to capital. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our 2022 Annual Report. Impact of Inflation The U.S. economy is experiencing the highest rates of inflation since the 1980s. Through December 31, 2022, we have continued to limit the impact of inflation on our members, and maintain significantly lower inflation impact across our diverse product portfolio than national levels. However, there is still some level of risk and uncertainty for our members and other customers in 2023 as labor costs, raw material cost and availability, rising interest rates and inflation continue to pressure supplier pricing as well as apply significant pressure on our margin.
We continue to measure the contributing factors, specifically transportation and freight, raw materials, and labor, that led to temporary adjustments to selling prices. We have begun to see logistics costs normalize to pre-pandemic levels as well as some reductions in specific raw materials; however, the cost of labor remains high. We are continuously working to lower these price increases as market conditions change. The impact of inflation to our aggregated product portfolio is partially mitigated by contract term price protection for a large portion of our portfolio, as well as continued price reductions in certain product categories such as pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, as the Federal Reserve seeks to curb rising inflation, market interest rates have steadily risen, and may continue to rise, increasing the cost of borrowing under our Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8 - Debt and Notes Payable to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) as well as impacting our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Refer to Note 1 - Organization and Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for more information related to our use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements as well as information related to material changes in our significant accounting policies that were included in our 2022 Annual Report. New Accounting Standards New accounting standards that we have recently adopted are included in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Key Components of Our Results of Operations Net Revenue Net revenue consists of net administrative fees revenue, software licenses, other services and support revenue, and products revenue.
Supply Chain Services Supply Chain Services revenue is comprised of: 32 • net administrative fees revenue which consists of gross administrative fees received from suppliers, reduced by the amount of revenue share paid to members; • software licenses, other services and support revenue which consist of supply chain co-management and purchased services revenue; and
• products revenue which consists of inventory sales. The success of our Supply Chain Services revenue streams is influenced by our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with suppliers and members, the number of members that utilize our GPO supplier contracts and the volume of their purchases, the impact of changes in the defined allowable reimbursement amounts determined by Medicare, Medicaid and other managed care plans and the number of members and other customers that purchase products through our direct sourcing activities and the impact of competitive pricing. Refer to “ Impact of Inflation ” within “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion of inflation and its impact on our Supply Chain Services’ businesses.
Performance Services Performance Services revenue is comprised of the following software licenses, other services and support revenue: • healthcare information technology license and SaaS-based clinical, margin improvement and value-based care products subscriptions, license fees, professional fees for consulting services, performance improvement collaborative and other service subscriptions and insurance services management fees and commissions from endorsed commercial insurance programs under our PINC AI technology and services platform;
• third-party administrator fees, fees from the centers of excellence program, and cost containment and wrap network fees pursuant to the TRPN acquisition for Contigo Health; and
• fees from healthcare product suppliers and service providers for Remitra.
Our Performance Services growth will depend upon the expansion of our PINC AI technology and services platform to new and existing members and other customers, renewal of existing subscriptions to our SaaS and licensed software products, our ability to sell enterprise analytics licenses to new and existing customers at rates sufficient to offset the loss of recurring SaaS-based revenue due to the conversion to an enterprise analytics license, expansion into new markets and expansion of our Contigo Health and Remitra businesses to new and existing members. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists of cost of services and software licenses revenue and cost of products revenue.
Cost of services and software licenses revenue includes expenses related to employees, consisting of compensation and benefits, and outside consultants who directly provide services related to revenue-generating activities, including consulting services to members and other customers, third-party administrator services and implementation services related to our SaaS and licensed software products along with associated amortization of certain capitalized contract costs. Amortization of contract costs represent amounts that have been capitalized and reflect the incremental costs of obtaining and fulfilling a contract including costs related to implementing SaaS informatics tools. Cost of services and software licenses revenue also includes expenses related to hosting services, related data center capacity costs, third-party product license expenses and amortization of the cost of internally developed software applications. Cost of products revenue consists of purchase and shipment costs for direct sourced medical and commodity products and is influenced by the manufacturing and transportation costs associated with direct sourced medical and commodity products. Refer to “ Impact of Inflation ” within “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion of inflation and its impact on our Supply Chain Services’ businesses.
Operating Expenses Operating expenses includes selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses, research and development expenses and amortization of purchased intangible assets.
SG&A expenses are directly associated with selling and administrative functions and support of revenue-generating activities including expenses to support and maintain our software-related products and services. SG&A expenses primarily consist of compensation- and benefits-related costs; travel-related expenses; business development expenses, including costs for business acquisition opportunities; non-recurring strategic initiative and financial restructuring-related expenses, indirect costs such as insurance, professional fees and other general overhead expenses, and amortization of certain contract costs. Amortization of
33 contract costs represent amounts, including sales commissions, that have been capitalized and reflect the incremental costs of obtaining and fulfilling a contract.
Research and development expenses consist of employee-related compensation and benefit expenses and third-party consulting fees of technology professionals, net of capitalized labor, incurred to develop our software-related products and services prior to reaching technological feasibility. Amortization of purchased intangible assets includes the amortization of all identified intangible assets. Other Income, Net Other income, net, includes equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates that is generated from our equity method investments. Our equity method investments primarily consist of our interests in FFF Enterprises, Inc. (“FFF”), Exela Holdings, Inc. (“Exela”), and Prestige Ameritech Ltd. (“Prestige”) (see Note 4 - Investments). Other income, net, also includes the fiscal year 2022 gain recognized due to the termination of the FFF Put Right and derecognition of the associated liability (see Note 5 - Fair Value Measurements), interest income and expense, realized and unrealized gains or losses on deferred compensation plan assets, gains or losses on the disposal of assets, and any impairment on our assets or held-to-maturity investments. Income Tax Expense
See Note 12 - Income Taxes for discussion of income tax expense.
Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest We recognize net income attributable to non-controlling interest for non-Premier ownership in our consolidated subsidiaries which hold interest in our equity method investments. At December 31, 2022, we recognized net income attributable to non-controlling interest for the 74%, 79% and 85% interest held in PRAM Holdings, LLC (“PRAM”), DePre Holdings, LLC (“DePre”) and ExPre Holdings, LLC (“ExPre”), respectively, by member health systems or their affiliates. PRAM, DePre and ExPre are investments we made as part of our long-term supply chain resiliency program to promote domestic and geographically diverse manufacturing and to help ensure a robust and resilient supply chain for essential medical products. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 93% of the equity interest in Contigo Health and recognized net income attributable to non-controlling interest for the 7% of equity held by certain customers of Contigo Health. Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The other key business metrics we consider are EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share and Free Cash Flow, which are all Non-GAAP financial measures. We define EBITDA as net income before income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, interest and investment income or expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and amortization of purchased intangible assets. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before merger and acquisition-related expenses and non-recurring, non-cash or non-operating items and including equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates. For all Non-GAAP financial measures, we consider non-recurring items to be income or expenses and other items that have not been earned or incurred within the prior two years and are not expected to recur within the next two years. Such items include certain strategic initiative and financial restructuring-related expenses. Non-operating items include gains or losses on the disposal of assets and interest and investment income or expense. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as the segment’s net revenue less cost of revenue and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment excluding depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangible assets, merger and acquisition-related expenses and non-recurring or non-cash items and including equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates. Operating expenses directly attributable to the segment include expenses associated with sales and marketing, general and administrative, and product development activities specific to the operation of each segment. General and administrative corporate expenses that are not specific to a particular segment are not included in the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA also excludes any income and expense that has been classified as discontinued operations.
We define Adjusted Net Income as net income attributable to Premier (i) excluding income or loss from discontinued operations, net, (ii) excluding income tax expense, (iii) excluding the impact of adjustment of redeemable limited partners’ capital to redemption amount, (iv) excluding the effect of non-recurring or non-cash items, including certain strategic initiative and financial restructuring-related expenses, (v) assuming, for periods prior to our August 2020 Restructuring, the exchange of all the Class B common units for shares of Class A common stock, which results in the elimination of non-controlling interest
34 in Premier LP and (vi) reflecting an adjustment for income tax expense on Non-GAAP net income before income taxes at our estimated annual effective income tax rate, adjusted for unusual or infrequent items. We define Adjusted Earnings per Share as Adjusted Net Income divided by diluted weighted average shares (see Note 10 - Earnings Per Share). We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less (i) early termination payments to certain former limited partners that elected to execute a Unit Exchange and Tax Receivable Acceleration Agreement (“Unit Exchange Agreement”) in connection with our August 2020 Restructuring and (ii) purchases of property and equipment. Free Cash Flow does not represent discretionary cash available for spending as it excludes certain contractual obligations such as debt repayments.
Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are supplemental financial measures used by us and by external users of our financial statements and are considered to be indicators of the operational strength and performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow measures allow us to assess our performance without regard to financing methods and capital structure and without the impact of other matters that we do not consider indicative of the operating performance of our business. More specifically, Segment Adjusted EBITDA is the primary earnings measure we use to evaluate the performance of our business segments. We use Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA assist our Board of Directors, management and investors in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period because they remove the impact of earnings elements attributable to our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization), certain items outside the control of our management team, e.g. taxes, other non-cash items (such as impairment of intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments and stock-based compensation), non-recurring items (such as strategic initiative and financial restructuring-related expenses) and income and expense that has been classified as discontinued operations from our operating results. We believe Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share assist our Board of Directors, management and investors in comparing our net income and earnings per share on a consistent basis from period to period because these measures remove non-cash (such as impairment of intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments and stock-based compensation) and non-recurring items (such as strategic initiative and financial restructuring-related expenses), and eliminate the variability of non-controlling interest that primarily resulted from member owner exchanges of Class B common units for shares of Class A common stock. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important measure because it represents the cash that we generate after payments to certain former limited partners that elected to execute a Unit Exchange Agreement in connection with our August 2020 Restructuring and capital investment to maintain existing products and services and ongoing business operations, as well as development of new and upgraded products and services to support future growth. Our Free Cash Flow allows us to enhance stockholder value through acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, investments in related businesses and debt reduction.
Despite the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in analyzing our business, determining compliance with certain financial covenants in our Credit Facility, measuring and determining incentive compensation and evaluating our operating performance relative to our competitors, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share and Free Cash Flow are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, may have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, net income, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of our performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations of the EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA measures include that they do not reflect: our capital expenditures or our future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; the interest expense or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments under our Credit Facility; income tax payments we are required to make; and any cash requirements for replacements of assets being depreciated or amortized. In addition, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not measures of liquidity under GAAP, or otherwise, and are not alternatives to cash flows from operating activities. Some of the limitations of the Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share measures are that they do not reflect income tax expense or income tax payments we are required to make. In addition, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share are not measures of profitability under GAAP. We also urge you to review the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage you to review the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. In addition, because the EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share and Free Cash Flow measures are susceptible to varying calculations, such Non-GAAP financial measures may differ from, and may therefore not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. 35 Non-recurring and non-cash items excluded in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income consist of stock-based compensation, acquisition- and disposition-related expenses, strategic initiative and financial restructuring-related expenses, gain or loss on FFF Put and Call Rights, income and expense that has been classified as discontinued operations and other reconciling items. More information about certain of the more significant items follows below. Income tax expense on adjusted income Adjusted Net Income, a Non-GAAP financial measure as defined below in “Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”, is calculated net of taxes based on our estimated annual effective tax rate for federal and state income tax, adjusted for unusual or infrequent items, as we are a consolidated group for tax purposes with all of our subsidiaries’ activities included. The tax rate used to compute the Adjusted Net Income was 26% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 25% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The 25% tax rate in fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to the benefit from the release of $32.3 million of valuation allowance of our deferred tax asset as a result of the Subsidiary Reorganization.
Of the $32.3 million valuation allowance released in fiscal year 2022, $6.5 million was included in the estimated annual effective tax rate calculation to the extent such carryforwards were projected to offset fiscal year 2022 ordinary income. The remaining $25.8 million of valuation allowance released was included as a discrete item in the six months ended December 31, 2021. Stock-based compensation In addition to non-cash employee stock-based compensation expense, this item includes non-cash stock purchase plan expense of $0.1 million for both the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and $0.3 million for both the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (see Note 11 - Stock-Based Compensation to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements). Acquisition- and disposition-related expenses Acquisition-related expenses include legal, accounting and other expenses related to acquisition activities and gains and losses on the change in fair value of earn-out liabilities. Disposition-related expenses include severance and retention benefits and financial advisor fees and legal fees related to disposition activities. Strategic initiative and financial restructuring-related expenses Strategic initiative and financial restructuring-related expenses include legal, accounting and other expenses related to strategic initiative and financial restructuring-related activities.
Gain on FFF Put and Call Rights See Note 5 - Fair Value Measurements to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Other reconciling items Other reconciling items include, but are not limited to, gains and losses on disposal of long-lived assets and imputed interest on notes payable to former limited partners. 36 Results of Operations

39 Consolidated Results - Comparison of the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 to 2021 The variances in the material factors contributing to the changes in the consolidated results are discussed further in “Segment Results” below.
Net Revenue Net revenue decreased by $19.6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to a decrease of $44.8 million in products revenue, partially offset by increases of $21.2 million in software licenses and other services and support revenue and $4.0 million in net administrative fees. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue decreased by $25.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to a decrease of $35.3 million in cost of products revenue, partially offset by an increase of $9.5 million in cost of services and software licenses.
Operating Expenses Operating expenses decreased by $3.9 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease of $6.3 million in SG&A expenses partially offset by an increase of $2.1 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
Other Income, Net Other income, net decreased by $5.6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease of $4.4 million in equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates and an increase of $1.7 million in interest expense, net.
Income Tax Expense For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded tax expense of $23.8 million and $6.4 million, respectively. The tax expense recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 resulted in effective tax rates of 27% and 8%, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the impact of the Subsidiary Reorganization on the prior year effective tax rate. (See Note 12 - Income Taxes to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.) Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest Net income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased by $1.4 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in the portion of net income attributable to non-controlling interests in PRAM, DePre, ExPre and Contigo Health.
Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP financial measure as defined in “Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”, decreased by $1.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by an increase of $4.2 million in Performance Services partially offset by a decrease of $6.3 million in Supply Chain Services. Corporate Adjusted EBITDA was flat compared to prior year.

The increase was primarily attributable to growth of $9.1 million in other revenue driven by growth in Contigo Health as well as incremental revenue from the TRPN acquisition, growth of $5.8 million in consulting services under our PINC AI platform and growth of $4.9 million in software licenses driven by an increased number of
enterprise analytics license agreements entered into during the current year period.
Cost of Revenue Performance Services segment cost of revenue increased by $16.7 million, or 20%, during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in consulting services expenses as well as higher personnel costs associated with increased headcount to support revenue growth.
Operating Expenses Performance Services segment operating expenses increased by $8.0 million, or 9%, during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was driven by an increase of $5.9 million in SG&A expenses due to higher personnel costs associated with increased headcount primarily in our PINC AI and Remitra businesses, as well as an increase of $2.0 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets primarily due to the TRPN acquisition.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA Performance Services Segment Adjusted EBITDA was flat for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. 45 Corporate The following table presents corporate expenses and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change 2022 2021 Change Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative $ 45,719  $ 55,933  $ (10,214) (18)% $ 85,625  $ 96,902  $ (11,277) (12)% Operating expenses 45,719  55,933  (10,214) (18)% 85,625  96,902  (11,277) (12)% Operating loss (45,719) (55,933) 10,214   (18)% (85,625) (96,902) 11,277   (12)% Depreciation and amortization 2,074  2,192  4,299  4,423  Stock-based compensation 2,801  16,330  10,150  24,081  Strategic initiative and financial restructuring-related expenses 7,527  3,749  9,046  3,774  Deferred compensation plan income 2,659  2,389  289  2,071  Other reconciling items, net —  (1) —  (2) Adjusted EBITDA $ (30,658) $ (31,274) $ 616   2% $ (61,841) $ (62,555) $ 714   1% Comparison of the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 to 2021
Operating Expenses
Corporate operating expenses decreased by $10.2 million, or 18%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense due to lower forecasted achievement of performance share awards, offset by an increase in professional fees related to strategic initiative and financial restructuring-related activities. Adjusted EBITDA Corporate adjusted EBITDA was flat for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Comparison of the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 to 2021
Operating Expenses
Corporate operating expenses decreased by $11.3 million, or 12%, during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense due to lower forecasted achievement of performance share awards as compared to prior year as well as a decrease in deferred compensation plan expense as a result of market changes. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in professional fees related to strategic initiatives and financial restructuring-related activities. Adjusted EBITDA Corporate adjusted EBITDA was flat for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal source of cash has been primarily cash provided by operating activities. From time to time we have used, and expect to use in the future, borrowings under our Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8 - Debt and Notes Payable to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) as a source of liquidity. Our primary cash requirements include operating expenses, working capital fluctuations, revenue share obligations, tax payments, capital expenditures, dividend payments on our Class A common stock, if and when declared, repurchases of Class A common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs in place from time to time, acquisitions and related business investments, and general corporate activities.
46 Our capital expenditures typically consist of internally developed software costs, software purchases and computer hardware purchases.
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $94.6 million and $86.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, there was $300.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, of outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we borrowed $285.0 million and repaid $135.0 million under our Prior Loan Agreement (as defined in Note 8 - Debt and Notes Payable to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements), which was used for other general corporate purposes and to partially fund the TRPN acquisition (see Note 3 - Business Acquisitions for further information). For the six months ended December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings or repayments under the Credit Facility. In January 2023, we repaid $30.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. We expect cash generated from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility to provide us with adequate liquidity to fund our anticipated working capital requirements, revenue share obligations, tax payments, capital expenditures, dividend payments on our Class A common stock, if and when declared, repurchases of Class A common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs in place from time to time and to fund business acquisitions. Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including funding requirements for our product and service development and commercialization efforts, our information technology requirements, and the amount of cash generated by our operations. We believe that we have adequate capital resources at our disposal to fund currently anticipated capital expenditures, business growth and expansion, and current and projected debt service requirements. However, strategic growth initiatives will likely require the use of one or a combination of various forms of capital resources including available cash on hand, cash generated from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facility and other long-term debt and, potentially, proceeds from the issuance of additional equity or debt securities. Discussion of Cash Flows for the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 A summary of net cash flows is as follows (in thousands): Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 196,725  $ 197,527  Investing activities (227,466) (68,660) Financing activities 39,230  (171,846) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash flows (9) (1) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 8,480   $ (42,980) Net cash provided by operating activities was flat for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $158.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the TRPN acquisition in the current year period, partially offset by the cash outlay for the investment in Exela Holdings, Inc. in the six months ended December 31, 2021 and a decrease in purchase of property and equipment.
Net cash provided by financing activities changed by $211.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The change in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by the prior year cash outflow of $173.9 million for the repurchase of Class A common stock under our fiscal 2022 stock repurchase program and an increase of $100.0 million in net borrowings under our Credit Facility. These changes were partially offset by $36.6 million less proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock in connection with the exercise of outstanding stock options in the current year period as compared to the prior year period as well as a decrease of $24.7 million in other financing activities. The change in other financing activities was primarily driven by fiscal 2022 proceeds from member health systems that acquired membership interests in ExPre in fiscal 2022. Discussion of Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow for the
Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 We define Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less early termination payments to certain former limited partners that elected to execute a Unit Exchange Agreement in connection with our August 2020 Restructuring and purchases of property and equipment. Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow does not represent
47 discretionary cash available for spending as it excludes certain contractual obligations such as debt repayments under our Credit Facility.
A summary of Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities for the periods presented is as follows (in thousands): Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 196,725  $ 197,527  Purchases of property and equipment (38,416) (42,660) Early termination payments to certain former limited partners that elected to execute a Unit Exchange Agreement
(a) (48,670) (47,741) Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow $ 109,639   $ 107,126   _________________________________ (a) Early termination payments to certain former limited partners that elected to execute a Unit Exchange Agreement in connection with our August 2020 Restructuring are presented in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows under “Payments made on notes payable.” During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we paid $51.3 million to members including imputed interest of $2.7 million which is included in net cash provided by operating activities. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, we paid $51.3 million to members including imputed interest of $3.6 million which is included in net cash provided by operating activities. See Note 8 - Debt and Notes Payable to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further information.
Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow increased by $2.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow was primarily due to a decrease of $4.2 million in purchases of property and equipment.
See “Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” above for additional information regarding our use of Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow. Contractual Obligations Notes Payable to Former Limited Partners At December 31, 2022, $256.7 million remains to be paid without interest in 10 equal quarterly installments to former limited partners that elected to execute Unit Exchange Agreements ending with the quarter ended June 30, 2025. See Note 8 - Debt and Notes Payable to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.
Other Notes Payable At December 31, 2022, we had commitments of $3.0 million for other obligations under notes payable. Other notes payable have stated maturities between three to five years from the date of issuance and are non-interest bearing. See Note 8 - Debt and Notes Payable to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. Credit Facility Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8 - Debt and Notes Payable to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for more information) bear interest on a variable rate structure with borrowings bearing interest at either the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus an adjustment of 0.100% plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.250% to 1.750% or the prime lending rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.250% to 0.750%. We pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.225% for unused capacity under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2022, the interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility was 5.633% and the commitment fee was 0.125%.
The Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at December 31, 2022. The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including a cross-default of any indebtedness or guarantees in excess of $75.0 million. If any event of default occurs and is continuing, the administrative agent under the Credit Facility may, with the consent, or shall, at the request of a majority of the lenders under the Credit Facility, terminate the commitments and declare all of the amounts owed under the Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable.
Proceeds from borrowings under the Credit Facility may generally be used to finance ongoing working capital requirements, including permitted acquisitions, repurchases of Class A common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs, in place from time to time, dividend payments, if and when declared, and other general corporate activities. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings of $300.0 million under the Credit Facility with $699.9 million of available borrowing capacity after
48 reductions for outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit. In January 2023, we repaid $30.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. The above summary does not purport to be complete, and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the complete text of the Credit Facility, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this quarterly report. See also Note 8 - Debt and Notes Payable to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Cash Dividends In each of September 2022 and December 2022, we paid a cash dividend of $0.21 per share on outstanding shares of Class A common stock. On January 26, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share, payable on March 15, 2023 to stockholders of record on March 1, 2023. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue to be paid on or about December 15, March 15, June 15, and September 15. However, the actual declaration of any future cash dividends, and the setting of record and payment dates as well as the per share amounts, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors each quarter after consideration of various factors, including our results of operations, financial condition and capital requirements, earnings, general business conditions, restrictions imposed by our current credit facility and any future financing arrangements, legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Fiscal 2023 Developments COVID-19 Pandemic, Variants Thereof, Recurrences or Similar Pandemics
The COVID-19 global pandemic and its variants continue to create challenges throughout the United States and the rest of the world. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity in the future will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and variants thereof, the continued actions to contain it and treat its impact, including the success of COVID-19 vaccination programs, or recurrences of COVID-19, variants thereof or similar pandemics. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our 2022 Annual Report as well as “Market and Industry Trends and Outlook” within Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report for further discussion of the material risks we face. Russia-Ukraine War In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine which resulted in sanctions, export controls and other measures imposed against Russia, Belarus and specific areas within Ukraine. As the war endures, it continues to affect the global economy and financial markets, as well as exacerbating ongoing economic challenges, including issues such as rising inflation, energy costs and global supply-chain disruption. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our 2022 Annual Report as well as “Market and Industry Trends and Outlook” within Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report for further discussion. Impact of Inflation The U.S. economy is experiencing the highest rates of inflation since the 1980s. Through December 31, 2022, we have continued to limit the impact of inflation on our members, and maintain significantly lower inflation impact across our diverse product portfolio than national levels. However, there is still some level of risk and uncertainty for our members and other customers in 2023 as labor costs, raw material cost and availability, rising interest rates and inflation continue to pressure supplier pricing as well as apply significant pressure on our margin.
We continue to measure the contributing factors, specifically transportation and freight, raw materials, and labor, that led to temporary adjustments to selling prices. We have begun to see logistics costs normalize to pre-pandemic levels as well as some reductions in specific raw materials; however, the cost of labor remains high. We are continuously working to lower these price increases as market conditions change. The impact of inflation to our aggregated product portfolio is partially mitigated by contract term price protection for a large portion of our portfolio, as well as continued price reductions in certain product categories such as pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, as the Federal Reserve seeks to curb rising inflation, market interest rates have steadily risen, and may continue to rise, increasing the cost of borrowing under our Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8 - Debt and Notes Payable to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) as well as impacting our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 49 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of any interest expense we must pay with respect to outstanding variable-rate debt instruments. At December 31, 2022, we had $300.0 million outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility. Based on the weighted average interest rate charged on outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility at December 31, 2022, a one-percent change in the weighted average interest rate charged on outstanding borrowings would increase or decrease interest expense over the next twelve months by $3.0 million.
We invest our excess cash in a portfolio of individual cash equivalents. We do not hold any material derivative financial instruments. We do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. We plan to mitigate default, market, and investment risks of our invested funds by investing in low-risk securities. Foreign Currency Risk
Substantially all of our financial transactions are conducted in U.S. dollars. We do not have significant foreign operations and, accordingly, do not believe we have market risk associated with foreign currencies. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon our evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. Management’s quarterly evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures did not include an assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures for certain assets of TRPN, which was acquired during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and is included in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and for the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2022. The aggregate assets and total net revenues of TRPN accounted for 5.1% and 0.4%, respectively, of the condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
50 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We operate businesses that are subject to substantial litigation from time to time. We are periodically involved in litigation, arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, which from time to time may include claims relating to contractual disputes, product liability, tort or personal injury, employment, antitrust, intellectual property or other commercial or regulatory matters. If current or future government regulations are interpreted or enforced in a manner adverse to us or our business, including without limitation those with respect to antitrust or healthcare laws, we may be subject to enforcement actions, penalties, damages and material limitations on our business.
From time to time, we have been named as a defendant in class action or other antitrust lawsuits brought by suppliers or purchasers of medical products. Typically, these lawsuits have alleged the existence of a conspiracy among manufacturers of competing products, distributors and/or operators of GPOs, including us, to deny the plaintiff access to a market for certain products, to raise the prices for products and/or limit the plaintiff’s choice of products to buy. We believe that we have at all times conducted our business affairs in an ethical and legally compliant manner and have successfully resolved all such actions. No assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to similar actions in the future or that any such existing or future matters will be resolved in a manner satisfactory to us or which will not harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. On March 4, 2022, a shareholder derivative complaint captioned City of Warren General Employees’ Retirement System v. Michael Alkire, et al., Case No. 2022-0207-JTL, purportedly brought on behalf of Premier, was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against our current and former Chief Executive Officers and certain current and former directors. We are named as a nominal defendant in the complaint. The lawsuit alleges that the named officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties and committed corporate waste by approving agreements between Premier and certain of the former LPs that provided for accelerated payments as consideration for the early termination of the TRA with such LPs. The complaint asserts that the aggregate early termination payment amounts of $473.5 million exceeded the alleged value of the tax assets underlying the TRA by approximately $225.0 million.
The complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, including attorney fees, and declaratory and other equitable relief. Since the lawsuit is purportedly brought on behalf of Premier, and we are only a nominal defendant, the alleged damages were allegedly suffered by us. We and the individual defendants deny the allegations in the complaint and intend to vigorously defend the litigation. In light of the fact that the lawsuit is in an early stage and the claims do not specify an amount of damages, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the suit. Additional information relating to certain legal proceedings in which we are involved is included in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
