Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2022   NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   Cytta Corp., (“Cytta” or the “Company”) was incorporated on May 30, 2006 under the laws of the State of Nevada. It is located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Cytta is in the business of imagineering, developing and securing disruptive technologies.
NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 28,975,715
and has also generated losses since inception. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.   In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged. Because COVID-19 infections have been reported throughout the United States, certain federal, state and local governmental authorities have issued stay-at-home orders, proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, and reduced operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but it may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Management expects that its business will be impacted to some degree, but the significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company’s business and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time.   The Company develops and distributes proprietary technology that radically shifts how video is streamed, consumed, transferred and stored. Our proprietary SUPR Stream is the technology at the core of our products, designed specifically for streaming and storing HD, 4K, and higher resolution video. The IGAN (Incident Global Area Network) Incident Command System (ICS) seamlessly streams and stores all relevant video and audio during emergency situations. This creates real-time situational awareness for police, firefighters, first responders, EMS, and their command centers. Our products work in size, weight, and power-constrained (SWaP) operating environments, and evolved through use in the military by meeting the need to stream multiple HD, 4K, and 4K+ video feeds with ultra-low latency, bandwidth, and power consumption. The Company is taking this streaming, storage, and transfer technology to enterprises that would like to send more high-quality videos with fewer resources. All of our products are manufactured in the USA.   The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may not be sufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation   The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period.
7 Table of Contents   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original term of three months or less to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalent balances may, at certain times, exceed federally insured limits. The Company has no cash equivalents at December 31, 2022, and 2021.   Accounts Receivable   The Company records accounts receivable at the time products and services are delivered. An allowance for losses is established through a provision for losses charged to expenses. Receivables are charged against the allowance for losses when management believes collectability is unlikely. The allowance (if any) is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses on existing receivables, based on evaluation of the collectability of the accounts and prior loss experience.   Prepaid expenses   The Company considers expenses or services paid for prior to the period the expense is completed to be recorded as a prepaid expense. Included in this account is the value of common stock issued to consultants. Such issuances are pursuant to consulting agreements that can have a one-to-two-year term. The Company amortized the value of the stock issued over the term of the agreement. The activity for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is summarized as:       December 31,       2022     2021   Balance beginning of period   $ 32,897     $ 772,394   Value of common stock issued     -       860,267   Amortization of stock-based compensation     -       ( 425,985
) Other prepaid expense activity     ( 5,970
)     ( 3,440
)     $ 26,927     $ 1,203,236     Inventory   Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on the first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs include finished goods and component parts. In evaluating the net realizable value of inventory, management also considers, if applicable, other factors, including known trends, market conditions, currency exchange rates and other such issues. Inventory as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, was $- 0 - and $- 0 -, respectively.
Property and equipment   Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is provided by use of a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.   The Company reviews property and equipment for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment is as follows:     Vehicles and equipment 5
years   Software 3
years     8 Table of Contents   Fair value of financial instruments   The Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level.   The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:     ● Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   ● Level 2 - Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.   ● Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.   The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, certain notes payable and notes payable - related party, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.   Revenue recognition   Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from the commercial sales of products by: (1) identify the contract (if any) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract (if any); (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract (if any); and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company has no outstanding contracts with any of its’ customers. The Company recognizes revenue when title, ownership, and risk of loss pass to the customer, all of which occurs upon shipment or delivery of the product and is based on the applicable shipping terms.   Stock-based compensation   The Company accounts for its stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”)(ASC 718) using the modified prospective method for transactions in which the Company obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions and the Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 96-18 “Accounting For Equity Instruments That Are Issued To Other Than Employees For Acquiring, Or In Conjunction With Selling Goods Or Services” (“EITF No. 96-18”) for share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in SFAS No. 123(R) (ASC 718). All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the third-party performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur.     9 Table of Contents   Income taxes   The Company accounts for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS No. 109”) (ASC 740). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.   Cash flows reporting   The Company follows the provisions of ASC 230 for cash flows reporting and accordingly classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (“Indirect method”) as defined by ASC 230 to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments.   Reporting segments   ASC 280 establishes standards for the way that public enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires reporting of selected information about operating segments in interim financial statements regarding products and services, geographic areas and major customers. ASC 280 defines operating segments as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performances. Currently, ASC 280 has no effect on the Company’s financial statements as substantially all of the Company’s operations are conducted in one industry segment.   Concentrations of Credit Risk   The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents and related party payables it will likely incur in the near future. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times, its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Company’s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited.   Earnings (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock   The Company has adopted ASC 260-10-20, “Earnings per Share,” (“EPS”) which requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. In the accompanying financial statements, basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   Other than the above there have no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the three months ended December 31, 2022, that are of significance or potential significance to the Company.     10 Table of Contents   NOTE 4 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   The following table represents the Company’s property and equipment as of December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022:       December 31, 2022     September 30, 2022   Property and equipment   $ 230,900     $ 230,900   Accumulated depreciation     ( 119,814

ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely- than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.   In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management must determine that there will be sufficient taxable income to allow for the realization of deferred tax assets. Based upon the historical and anticipated future income, management has determined that the deferred tax assets do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for realizability. Accordingly, there is a full valuation allowance provided against the Company’s deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022, and September 30, 2022.   In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management must determine that there will be sufficient taxable income to allow for the realization of deferred tax assets.

Our current capital and our other existing resources will not be sufficient to provide the working capital needed for our current business Additional capital will be required to meet our obligations, and to further expand our business. We may be unable to obtain the additional capital required. Our inability to generate capital or raise additional funds when required will have a negative impact on our business development and financial results. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as well as our recurring losses from operations and the need to raise additional capital to fund operations. This “going concern” could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of debt or equity securities.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $28,975,715 and has also generated losses since inception. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.   As of December 31, 2022, we had cash of $143,341 compared to $755,122 at September 30, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we had current assets of $175,263 and current liabilities of $517,990, which resulted in working capital deficiency of $342,727. The current liabilities are comprised of accounts payable, accounts payable-related parties, accrued expenses, deferred revenue and stock to be issued.   In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged. Because COVID-19 infections have been reported throughout the United States, certain federal, state and local governmental authorities have issued stay-at-home orders, proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, and reduced operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but it may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Management expects that its business will be impacted to some degree, but the significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company’s business and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time.   Operating Activities   For the three months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $611,781 compared to $522,310 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, our net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the net loss of $1,100,708, adjusted by stock-based compensation of $407,275 and depreciation of $11,904. Net changes of $69,748 in operating assets and liabilities decreased the cash used in operating activities.     17 Table of Contents   For the three months ended December 31, 2021, our net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the net loss of $1,164,106, adjusted by stock-based compensation of $455.985 and depreciation of $11,904. Net changes of $173,906 in operating assets and liabilities decreased the cash used in operating activities.   Investing Activities   For the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, there was no cash used in investing activities.
Financing Activities   For the three months ended December 31, 2022, there were no financing activities. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $2,963,500, pursuant to the sale of 59,270,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock at $0.05 per share.   Critical Accounting Policies   Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 3 of our financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause an effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.   Accounts Receivable   The Company records accounts receivable at the time products and services are delivered. An allowance for losses is established through a provision for losses charged to expenses. Receivables are charged against the allowance for losses when management believes collectability is unlikely. The allowance (if any) is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses on existing receivables, based on evaluation of the collectability of the accounts and prior loss experience.   Property and Equipment   Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is provided by use of a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.   The Company reviews property and equipment for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment is as follows:     Vehicles and equipment 5 years   Software 3 years   Revenue Recognition   Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from the commercial sales of products by: (1) identify the contract (if any) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract (if any); (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract (if any); and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company has no outstanding contracts with any of its’ customers. The Company recognizes revenue when title, ownership, and risk of loss pass to the customer, all of which occurs upon shipment or delivery of the product and is based on the applicable shipping terms.     18 Table of Contents   Stock-Based Compensation   The Company accounts for its stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”)(ASC 718) using the modified prospective method for transactions in which the Company obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions and the Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 96-18 “Accounting For Equity Instruments That Are Issued To Other Than Employees For Acquiring, Or In Conjunction With Selling Goods Or Services” (“EITF No. 96-18”) for share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in SFAS No. 123(R) (ASC 718). All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the third-party performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur.   Earnings (Loss) Per Share   The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, “Earnings per Share.” ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options, using the treasury stock method, and convertible notes and stock warrants, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options, warrants and conversion of convertible notes. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   We have no off-balance sheet arrangements including arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits.   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   Not Applicable.   Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for the reasons discussed below.     19 Table of Contents   A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.     1.
We do not have an Audit Committee – While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management’s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company’s financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management’s activities.         2.
We did not maintain appropriate cash controls – As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for cash, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signatures on the Company’s bank accounts.
Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls.   Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.   Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting   There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     20 Table of Contents   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   On November 24, 2020, Lee Skoblow (the “Plaintiff”) filed a complaint in the State District Court for Clark County, Nevada, naming Cytta as a Defendant. The Plaintiff contends that the Company had breached an agreement. On or about January 15, 2021, the Defendant filed an Answer and Counterclaim in the litigation and also contended that in fact the Plaintiff owed money to Cytta having breached an earlier services agreement, of limited scope and duration, and was liable for defaming Cytta in various communications he had sent to certain persons or entities. Management has been contesting the matter vigorously. A bench trial was held in June 2022, and the court has not yet made a ruling.
Other than the above, we know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our Company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.   Item 1A.
