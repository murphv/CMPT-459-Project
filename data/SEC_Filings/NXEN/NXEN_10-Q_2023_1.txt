Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation
Nexien
BioPharma, Inc. (the “Company” or “Nexien”) was incorporated in the State of Michigan on November 10, 1952 as
Gantos, Inc., and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 2008, changing its name to Kinder Holding Corp. In October 2017, the Company
completed a reverse acquisition of Intiva BioPharma Inc., a Colorado corporation (“BioPharma”), incorporated on March 27,
2017, through an exchange of shares (the “Share Exchange Transaction”) and changed its name to Intiva BioPharma Inc. In September
2018, the Company changed its name to Nexien BioPharma, Inc.
As
further described in Note 4, BioPharma became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Since this transaction resulted in the existing
shareholders of BioPharma acquiring control of the Company, for financial reporting purposes, the business combination has been accounted
for as an additional capitalization of the Company (a reverse acquisition with BioPharma as the accounting acquirer). The operations
of BioPharma were the only continuing operations of the Company.
BioPharma
was incorporated to pursue pre-clinical and drug development activities, in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)
protocols, for certain pharmaceutical formulations that include cannabinoids. It is pursuing the formulation and development of drugs
containing cannabinoids for the treatment of various diseases, disorders and medical conditions, and owns a license covering certain
intellectual property, including certain patent applications, and has filed three of its own provisional patent applications for other
drugs that include cannabinoids and other substances, including terpenes, that are intended to be developed with the objective of treating
certain medical conditions and disorders. It was formed as a corporate subsidiary of the Colorado corporation Kanativa USA Inc. (“Kanativa
USA”), which is a subsidiary of the Ontario, Canada corporation, Kanativa Inc.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include BioPharma and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Intiva BioPharma Inc. (a Colorado
corporation), NexN Inc. (“NexN”) and NexDM Inc. (collectively the “Company”), and were prepared from the accounts
of the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP). All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.
Note
2 -
Going Concern Uncertainty
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a
going concern. The Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs, and as such, has incurred an operating
loss since inception of $ 11,121,924 . The development of pharmaceuticals with the objective of obtaining approval by the FDA and other
international regulatory authorities is not a short-term endeavor for any specific drug candidate. It also requires extremely significant
amounts of capital funding for clinical trials and other matters. At December 31, 2022, the Company had a working capital deficit of
$ 202,321 . The Company will require significant additional capital to fund the implementation and execution of its business plan. This
capital, which likely will be millions of dollars for a single drug candidate, will be required for research, regulatory applications,
and clinical trials. At the present time, the Company does not have any commitments or known sources for this level of funding. These
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial
statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or
the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from the estimates.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
For
financial statement presentation purposes, the Company considers those short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents. There were
no
cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.
Valuation
of Long-Lived Assets
The
Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets including equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, when events or
changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible
impairment is based on the Company’s ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pre-tax cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset,
an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value. The Company’s primary measure
of fair value is based on discounted cash flows. The measurement of impairment requires management to make estimates of these cash flows
related to long-lived assets, as well as other fair value determinations.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
FASB
ASC 825, “Financial Instruments,” requires entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and
liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. FASB ASC 825 defines
fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing
parties. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the carrying value of certain financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents, accounts
payable and accrued expenses) approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments or interest rates, which are comparable
with current rates.
Fair
Value Measurements
The
Company measures fair value under a framework that utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of inputs
which prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value are:
Level
1: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company
has the ability to access.
Level
2: Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
●
Quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;
●
Quoted
prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets;
●
Inputs
other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability;
●
Inputs
that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

NEXIEN
BIOPHARMA, INC.
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note
3 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
If
the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the
asset or liability.
Level
3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
The
assets or liabilities fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs.
When
the Company changes its valuation inputs for measuring financial assets and liabilities at fair value, either due to changes in current
market conditions or other factors, it may need to transfer those assets or liabilities to another level in the hierarchy based on the
new inputs used. The Company recognizes these transfers at the end of the reporting period that the transfers occur. For the periods
ended December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, there were no significant transfers of financial assets or financial liabilities between the
hierarchy levels.
As
at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, no assets or liabilities were required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
Earnings
per Common Share
The
Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earning per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic
and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available
to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS
gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred
stock using the if-converted method. In computing Diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number
of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares
if their effect is anti-dilutive. At December 31, 2022, there were potentially dilutive securities convertible into shares of common
stock comprised of (i) stock options – convertible into
7,995,000
shares, (ii) warrants – convertible into
5,529,409
shares
and (iii) promissory notes – convertible into
6,597,414
shares.
Income
Taxes
The
Company has adopted ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Pursuant to ASC 740, the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits
for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in these financial
statements because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward
in future years.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company has adopted ASC 606 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from the commercial
sales of products, licensing agreements and contracts to perform pilot studies by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract
with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction
price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied.
Research
and Development Expenses
Research
and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred.

Advertising
Expenses
Advertising
expenses are charged to operations as incurred. There were
no

Stock-based
compensation
Pursuant
to FASB ASC 718, all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized in the statement of
operations based on their fair values.
Issuance
of shares for non-cash consideration
The
Company accounts for the issuance of equity instruments to acquire goods and/or services based on the fair value of the goods and services
or the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of issuance, whichever is more reliably determinable. The Company’s accounting
policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of the standards
issued by the FASB. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined as the earlier of (i) the
date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor’s
performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized
over the term of the consulting agreement.
Reclassifications
Certain
amounts in the consolidated financial statements for prior year periods have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
Although
there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB, which the Company has adopted or will adopt, as
applicable, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on its consolidated
financial position or results of operations. Management has evaluated accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective
as of December 31, 2022 and does not expect such pronouncements to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position,
operations, or cash flows.

Share Exchange Agreement
On
August 8, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement, as amended and restated on October 13, 2017 (the “Agreement”),
with BioPharma. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue to the shareholders of BioPharma
42,642,712
post-reverse
stock-split shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $ 0.0001
(“Common Stock”), in exchange for all of the issued
and outstanding shares of BioPharma capital stock, thereby making BioPharma a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As part of the
Closing of the Agreement, the
20,000,000
pre-reverse split shares of the Company’s Common Stock previously purchased by Kanativa
USA, effective on June 26, 2017 in a change in control transaction from the Company’s control shareholders, were canceled. Since
this transaction resulted in the existing shareholders of BioPharma acquiring control of the Company, for financial reporting purposes,
the business combination has been accounted for as an additional capitalization of the Company (a reverse acquisition with BioPharma
as the accounting acquirer).

Upon execution of the agreement, as amended September 18, 2018, $ 35,000
was paid to the licensor; an additional $ 30,000
was paid in cash
during the year ended June 30, 2019; and a final payment of $ 35,000
was paid in common stock of the Company during the year ended June
30, 2020. The Company is required to pay milestone payments upon obtaining regulatory approval of pharmaceutical licensed products and
royalties based upon sales of licensed products. The Company may grant sublicenses under the terms of the agreement.
The
Company had previously estimated that it may not be able to recover the $ 65,000
of costs capitalized under the Accu-Break License Agreement,
and recognized an impairment of $ 65,000
for the license at June 30, 2019. The $ 35,000
value of common stock issued in the year ended
June 30, 2020 was charged to operations. Although the Company has recognized an impairment under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,
it retains its rights under the Accu-Break license agreement.

Convertible Notes Payable
Convertible
note purchase agreement
On
January 18, 2022, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with Quick Capital pursuant to which the Company issued Quick Capital
a twelve-month convertible promissory note, due January 18, 2023, in the principal amount of $ 170,454
(the “Note”). The Company
received net proceeds of $ 146,750
from the note, after Quick Capital’s legal fees of $ 3,250 , and an original issuance discount
of
12 % ($ 23,704 ). In connection with the Note issuance, Quick Capital was also issued
500,000
restricted shares of the Company’s
common stock and a
three-year
warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase up to an aggregate of
347,512
restricted shares of the
Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $ 0.075
per share). These issuances were valued and then using the relative fair
value method of the cash received on the Note began with an unamortized discount totaling $ 27,383 . At December 31, 2022 and June 30,
2022, the balance due on the Note is $ 167,652
(net of unamortized discount of $ 2,082 ) and $ 142,180
(net of unamortized discount of $ 28,274 ),
respectively.

7 – Convertible Notes Payable (continued)
Quick
Capital is entitled to a cash payment of $ 20,000
as liquidated damages for any failure to include all shares issuable upon the conversion
of the Note (the “Conversion Shares”) and the Warrant Shares on any registration statement filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. For twelve months following the issuance of the Quick Note, Quick Capital will have the right of first refusal to
participate in future financings proposed to the Company by bonafide third parties on the same terms as such third parties and participation
rights to purchase up to $ 1,000,000
of securities in other offerings, subject to certain exceptions.
The
Note is convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $ 0.035
per share. The Note may be prepaid at any time within
the first six months at
130 % of face value. Thereafter, the Note can only be prepaid at Quick Capital’s discretion.
If
an event of default (as described in the Note) occurs, the Note will become immediately due and payable in an amount equal to
150 % of
the then outstanding principal amount of the Note plus any interest or amounts owing to Quick Capital.
The
Note may not be converted and the Warrant may not be exercised if after giving effect to such conversion or exercise, as the case may
be, Quick Capital and its affiliates would beneficially own more than
9.99 % of the outstanding common stock of the Company. On or after
May 7, 2022 and upon the mutual agreement of the Company and Quick Capital, Quick Capital may purchase additional note(s) in an aggregate
amount not to exceed $ 350,000
on similar terms.
The
Company has recorded the original issue discount, legal fees, financing shares and warrants of the Note, aggregating $ 51,087
as a discount
to the Note. The fair value for the expense portion of the Note is being amortized over the term of the Note. This fair value has been
determined based on the current trading prices of the Company’s common stock. Management has determined that this treatment is
appropriate given the uncertain nature of the value of the Company and its stock, and there will be no revaluations until the Note is
paid or redeemed for stock. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, $ 25,472
was charged to operations for amortization of the
recorded discount. The Company is currently in negotiations with Quick Capital for extension of the Note.
Convertible
notes payable - related
On
November 24, 2020, the Company entered into financing agreements with two individuals, its CEO and a shareholder. Under the agreements,
the Company issued unsecured convertible promissory notes due in
three years
( November 24, 2023 ) with accrued interest at the rate of
8 % per annum, compounded annually. The notes and accrued interest are convertible at the option of the holders at any time into restricted
shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $ 0.037631 , being the volume-weighted average price of the common stock over
the
10
trading days immediately preceding the date the notes were funded. The CEO was issued a note in the principal amount of $ 40,000 ,
which included a $ 15,000
advance made in October 2020 and an additional loan of $ 25,000 . A stockholder of the Company loaned $ 25,000
on these terms. Both lenders were also issued three types of warrants, exercisable for a
five-year
period, at prices of $ 0.040265 , $ 0.043276 ,
and $ 0.045157 , to purchase a total of
5,181,897
shares.
The
Company has recorded the conversion feature as a Beneficial Conversion Feature. The fair value of $ 65,000
for the expense portion of
the notes is being amortized over the term of the notes. As the warrants exceeded the value of the notes themselves, the discount is
the entire amount of the notes. This fair value has been determined based on the current trading prices of the Company’s common
stock. Management has determined that this treatment is appropriate given the uncertain nature of the value of the Company and its stock,
and there will be no revaluations until the note is paid or redeemed for stock. The note holders have agreed not to convert the loans
unless sufficient shares of common stock are available for conversion.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN OF OPERATION
Forward-Looking
Statements
The
following plan of operation provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results
of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto. This section
includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
Certain statements that the Company may make from time to time, including all statements contained in this report that are not statements
of historical fact, constitute “forward-looking statements”. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as
“plans,” “expects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “projects,”
“will,” “should,” and other words of similar meaning used in conjunction with, among other things, discussions
of future operations, financial performance, product development and new product launches, market position and expenditures. You should
not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions.
The
following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended
to help you understand our historical results of operations during the periods presented and our financial condition for the three and
six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements as of
June 30, 2022 and 2021.
Overview
We
are engaged in pursuing pre-clinical and drug development activities for certain pharmaceutical formulations that include cannabinoids.
We have filed three provisional patent applications, and acquired a license covering certain intellectual property related to a drug
delivery system.
As
a relatively new business engaged in start-up operations and activities, we will require substantial additional funding to successfully
complete any of our drug development programs. At present, we cannot estimate the substantial capital requirements needed to secure regulatory
approvals for our drug candidates. We estimate that we will need to raise at a minimum $50,000 just to maintain our existence as a public
company for the remainder of the current year.
We
are a start-up company with no revenues from operations. Notwithstanding our successful raise of $2,076,158, net of offering costs, in
equity capital and the receipt of $146,750, net of financing costs, from a debt issuance during the period from inception to December
31, 2022, there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months without a significant infusion
of capital or entering into a business combination transaction. We do not anticipate that Nexien BioPharma will generate revenues from
its research and development activities related to its drug development projects in the near future, due to the protracted revenue model
of pursuing pharmaceutical drug development in accordance with the pathway set forth by the FDA. The Company had to cease research and
development activities due to the lack of sufficient working capital. The Company received a funding commitment from a third-party lender
during the year ended June 30, 2022 and is evaluating the recommencing of research and development activities on its myotonic dystrophy
project. While management continues its efforts to raise additional capital for the Company, it is also seeking merger or other business
combination or restructuring opportunities.
Results
of Operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021
Net
loss for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $93,592, a decrease in loss of $126,602 from the net loss of $220,194 reported
for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
General
and administrative costs of $66,872 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 includes $50,750 as the value of non-cash stock-based
compensation costs for common shares issued to the Company’s officers. In comparison, general and administrative costs of $202,056
incurred for the three months ended December 31, 2021 includes non-cash charges of $163,255 for the fair value of the shares issued for
the acquisition of CRX Bio Holdings LLC and $35,500 as the value of non-cash stock-based compensation costs for common shares issued
to officers.
15
General
and administrative expenses, exclusive of non-cash compensation costs, were consistent during the 2022 and 2021 periods, and consisted
predominately of costs and expenses associated with the Company’s maintaining its public company status.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred $18,138 and $5,402, respectively, for amortization of discount
related to the convertible debt financings. Interest expense, all related to convertible debt financings, for the 2022 and 2021 periods
was $2,422 and $1,296, respectively. The increase in interest expense for 2022 is attributable to the convertible debt financing of January
2022.
There
were no research and development costs for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to the Company’s limited financial
resources and availability of research personnel.
Professional
fees of $6,160 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $5,280 from $11,440 for the period ended December 31, 2021.
Fees for the 2022 and 2021 periods consisted of legal fees for securities related matters and fees for auditor quarterly review and other
required tax and regulatory Fees for the 2021 period included partial fee incurrence for the 2021 fiscal year annual audit as the audit
was completed in October 2021, whereas the 2022 audit was completed in September 2022.
During
the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued 250,000 shares of common stock to each of three officers for services rendered
to the Company.
Results
of Operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021
Net
loss for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $188,466, a decrease in loss of $153,439 from the net loss of $341,905 reported for
the six months ended December 31, 2021.
General
and administrative costs of $125,927 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 includes $101,500 as the value of non-cash stock-based
compensation costs for common shares issued to the Company’s officers. In comparison, general and administrative costs of $310,955
incurred for the six months ended December 31, 2021 includes non-cash charges of $223,255 for the fair value of the shares issued for
the acquisition of CRX Bio Holdings LLC and $70,000 as the value of non-cash stock-based compensation costs for common shares issued
to officers.
General
and administrative expenses, exclusive of non-cash compensation costs, were consistent during the 2022 and 2021 periods, and consisted
predominately of costs and expenses associated with the Company’s maintaining its public company status.
During
the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred $36,276 and $10,863, respectively, for amortization of discount
related to the convertible debt financings. Interest expense, all related to convertible debt financings, for the 2022 and 2021 periods
was $4,843 and $2,607, respectively. The increase in interest expense for 2022 is attributable to the convertible debt financing of January
2022.
There
were no research and development costs for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to the Company’s limited financial
resources and availability of research personnel.
Professional
fees of $21,420 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $3,940 from $17,480 for the period ended December 31, 2021. Fees
for the 2022 and 2021 periods consisted of legal fees for securities related matters and fees for auditor annual audit and quarterly
review and other required tax and regulatory filings.
During
the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued 500,000 shares of common stock to each of three officers for services rendered
to the Company.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
At
December 31, 2022, we had a working capital deficit of $202,321 and cash of $68,991, as compared to a working capital deficit of $117,605
and cash of $116,898 at June 30, 2022. The decrease in both working capital and cash was due primarily to the utilization of existing
cash for operating activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022. Substantially all available funds were being utilized solely
for maintaining corporate operations as a public company. We used $47,907 of cash for operating activities during the six months ended
December 31, 2022.
16
While
management of the Company believes that the Company will be successful in its current and planned activities, there can be no assurance
that the Company will be successful in its drug development activities, and raise sufficient equity, debt capital or strategic relationships
to sustain the operations of the Company.
Our
ability to create sufficient working capital to sustain us over the next twelve-month period, and beyond, is dependent on our raising
additional equity or debt capital, or entering into strategic arrangements with one or more third parties.
There
can be no assurance that sufficient capital will be available to us. We currently have no agreements, arrangements or understandings
with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources.
Availability
of Additional Capital
Notwithstanding
our success in raising gross proceeds of $2.1 million from the private sale of equity securities through December 31, 2022, and the completion
of a debt financing agreement resulting in the receipt of $146,750 in January 2022, there can be no assurance that we will continue to
be successful in raising additional funds through equity capital and/or debt financings and have adequate capital resources to fund our
operations or that any additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms or in amounts required by us. We estimate that we
will require at a minimum $50,000 just to maintain our existence as a public company for the remainder of the current year.
Any
additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders, new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior
to those of existing holders of our shares of Common Stock. Debt or equity financing may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant
interest costs.
Capital
Expenditure Plan During the Next Twelve Months
To
date, we raised approximately $2.1 million, in equity capital (including exercised warrants) and $146,750 in debt financings, and we
may be expected to require a minimum of $50,000 in capital during the remainder of the year to continue our existence as a public company.
There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in raising capital in sufficient amounts and/or at terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Company. Our revenues are expected to come from our drug development projects. As a result, we will continue to incur
operating losses unless and until we have obtained regulatory approval with respect to one of our drug development projects and commence
to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our operating expenses. There can be no assurance that we will obtain regulatory approval and
the market will adopt our future drugs. In the event that we are not able to successfully: (i) raise equity capital and/or debt financing;
or (ii) market our drugs after obtaining regulatory approval, our financial condition and results of operations will be materially and
adversely affected.
Going
Concern Consideration
Our
registered independent auditors have issued an opinion on our financial statements as of June 30, 2022 which includes a statement describing
our going concern status. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve
months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills and meet our other financial obligations. This is because we have not generated
any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we begin marketing any drugs that we successfully develop. Accordingly, we must raise
capital from sources other than the actual sale from any drugs that we develop. We must raise capital to continue our drug development
activities and stay in business.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
At
December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation
S-K promulgated under the Securities Act of 1934.
17
Contractual
Obligations and Commitments
On
February 28, 2018, we obtained a worldwide exclusive license with respect to a proprietary delivery system for cannabinoid-based medications.
Upon execution of the agreement, as amended September 18, 2018, $35,000 was paid to the licensor. An additional $10,000 was paid on November
1, 2018, $20,000 was paid on February 28, 2019 and a final payment, in cash or stock at the option of the Company, of $35,000, due August
31, 2019, was paid in shares of our common stock. We are required to pay milestone payments upon obtaining regulatory approval of pharmaceutical
licensed products and royalties based upon sales of licensed products. We may grant sublicenses under the terms of the agreement.
