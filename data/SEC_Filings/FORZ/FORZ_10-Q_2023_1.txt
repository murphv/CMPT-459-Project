NOTE
1 -
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Forza
Innovations Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on December 9, 2014, under the laws of the State of Florida. The Company
was a diversified multi-industry manufacturer of complex metal components and products. We serve all general industrial markets such
as Aerospace, Automotive, Commercial, Food Processing, Industrial, Maritime, Medical, Railroad, Oil and Gas, Packaging, Telecom, Textiles,
Robotics, Space Travel, Transportation and many more. We are a vertically integrated precision CNC manufacturing and fabrication company
with core emphasis on product design, engineering and precision manufacturing of complex components and products.
On
February 5, 2018, the Company formed Genesys Industries, LLC as a wholly owned subsidiary in the state of Missouri.
On
January 21, 2021, Shefali Vibhakar, President of the Company closed a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) that she
entered into with Johnny Forzani to sell all of her
170,000,000
common shares and
10,000,000
preferred shares to Johnny Forzani for cash
consideration of $ 177,000 .
Further,
as part of the Agreement, Ms. Vibhakar agrees to spin out all of the Company’s assets (except for certain machinery valued at $ 40,000
– which is subject to a separate purchase agreement) as well as all of the Company’s liabilities (except the Company’s
note with Tangiers Capital, LLC). The value date of the assets and liabilities will be January 21, 2021.
On
January 21, 2021, a change in control of the Company occurred pursuant to the Agreement. Mr. Forzani now has voting control over
93.9%
of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock.
On
January 21, 2021, the Company received the resignation of Shefali Vibhakar as the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer,
Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Director and appointed Johnny Forzani as its President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer,
Chief Financial Officer and Secretary.
Effective
January 21, 2021, the Company’s new address is 30 Forzani Way NW, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T3Z 1L5.
On
February 17, 2021, the Company filed Articles of Continuance with the Secretary of State for the state of Wyoming. Accordingly, the Company
transferred its state of formation from Florida to Wyoming and became a Wyoming entity.
On
February 18, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State for the State of Florida, effectively dissolving
the Company's existence in Florida.
As
of June 30, 2021, Forza Innovations has moved out of the precision CNC manufacturing and fabrication business and has moved into the
health-tech wearable performance business.  The Company has acquired the ownership and rights to certain late developmental stage
products, including the J4 Sport, J4 X and J4 Fitbelt. These products are wearable back compression devices, used to relax, warmup, loosen,
or relax stiff & sore muscles. The therapeutic application of heat causes a change in temperature of the soft tissues which decreases
joint stiffness and relieves inflammation.
On
March 1, 2022, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Sustainable Origins Inc. (“Sustainable”),
whereby the Company acquired 100% of the shares of Sustainable in exchange for  600,000  shares of the Company’s common
stock and a cash payment of $ 17,000  and the payment of certain initial expenses, thereby making Sustainable a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company. Sustainable is in the business of used cooking oil recycling and has recently entered into an asset purchase agreement
with Oil Industries, Inc. of North Carolina to acquire certain assets related to the used cooking oil business. The Company valued the
shares of common stock at $ 0.038 , the closing stock price on the effective date of the agreement, for a valuation of $ 22,800 . At the
time of acquisition Sustainable had no operations. As such the Company fully impaired the $22,800. As of December 31, 2022, the shares
have not yet been issued to Sustainable.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows at December 31, 2022 and for the related periods presented have been made. The results for the six months ended December 31, 2022
are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. These financial statements and related footnotes should
be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended June 30, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
8
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Significant estimates
include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Concentrations
of Credit Risk
We
maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts, the balances of which at times may exceed federally insured limits. We continually monitor
our banking relationships and consequently have not experienced any losses in our accounts. We believe we are not exposed to any significant
credit risk on cash.
Cash
Equivalents
The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There
were
no
cash equivalents for the six months ended December 31, 2022, or the year ended June 30, 2022.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for three and six months ended December 31, 2022, include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Sustainable Origins. All material inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Reclassifications
Certain
reclassifications have been made to the prior period financial information to conform to the presentation used in the financial statements
for the period ended December 31, 2022.
Property,
Plant and Equipment
Property
and equipment are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Major betterments that extend the useful lives of assets are
also capitalized. Normal maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the
cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations.
Derivative
Financial Instruments
The
Company evaluates its convertible notes to determine if such instruments have derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded
derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded
at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations.
For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a weighted-average Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value
the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether
such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial
instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure
the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  To increase
consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy
which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels.  The fair value hierarchy
gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority
to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:
Level 1:
Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2:
Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as
of the reporting date.
Level 3:
Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
9
The
carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate
their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.  The Company’s notes payable amates the fair value of
such instruments as the notes bear interest rates that are consistent with current market rates.
The
following table classifies the Company’s asset measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the fair value hierarchy as of
December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022:

Basic
and Diluted Loss Per Share
Under
ASC 260 “Earnings Per Share,” the Company presents basic and diluted earnings (loss) per-share (“EPS”) amounts
on the face of the statements of operations. Basic EPS computed by dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders (the numerator)
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Shares issued during the period and
shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding. The computation of diluted
EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares
that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. Potentially diluted amounts from preferred
stock are not presented when the effect of the computations are anti-dilutive due to the losses incurred. Accordingly, there is no difference
in the amounts presented for basic and diluted loss per share.
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
The
Company has implemented all new applicable accounting pronouncements that are in effect.  These pronouncements did not have any
material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new
accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
NOTE
3 -
GOING CONCERN
The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has limited revenue and an accumulated deficit of $ 7,895,333
($ 3,069,884
of which is from the FY
2021 loss on the asset acquisition and disposition of assets).
While
the Company is successfully executing its growth strategy, its cash position may not still be sufficient to support the Company’s
daily operations without additional financing. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to produce sales volume and
in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity
for the Company to continue as a going concern.
NOTE

MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT
Long
lived assets, including property and equipment and certain intangible assets to be held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses
are recognized if expected future cash flows of the related assets are less than their carrying values. Measurement of an impairment
loss is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of are reported at
the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
10
Property
and Equipment and intangible assets are first recorded at cost. Depreciation and/or amortization is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets between three and five years. Leasehold improvements are being
depreciated over ten years, and the building over twenty years.
Maintenance
and repair expenses, as incurred, are charged to expense. Betterments and renewals are capitalized in plant and equipment accounts. Cost
and accumulated depreciation applicable to items replaced or retired are eliminated from the related accounts with any gain or loss on
the disposition included as income.
Property
and equipment stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation for continuing operations consisted of the following:

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements, included herewith. This discussion
should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion
reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present
assessment of our management.
Forward
Looking Statements
Certain
matters discussed herein are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q involve risks and
uncertainties, including statements as to:
• our
future operating results;
• our
business prospects;
• our
contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;
• the
dependence of our future success on the general economy;
• our
possible future financings; and
• the
adequacy of our cash resources and working capital.
These
forward-looking statements can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as we “believe,”
“anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate” or words of similar meaning. Similarly, statements that describe
our future plans, objectives or goals are also forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks
and uncertainties which are described in close proximity to such statements and which could cause actual results to differ materially
from those anticipated. Shareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors in evaluating the forward-looking
statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included
herein are only made as of the date of this Form 10-Q, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements
to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
Cautionary
Statement:
Statements
included in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in future filings by the
Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the Company’s press releases and in oral statements made with the approval
of an authorized executive officer that are not historical or current facts are “forward-looking statements.” These statements
are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected.
These risks and uncertainties are described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021, as well
as other filings the Company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company wishes to caution readers not to place undue
reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made and are not predictions of actual future results.
The Company disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the
date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
Plan
of Operations
The
Company has acquired the ownership and rights to certain late developmental stage products, including the J4 Sport, J4 X and J4 Fitbelt.
These products are wearable back compression devices, used to relax, warmup, loosen, or relax stiff & sore muscles. The therapeutic
application of heat causes a change in temperature of the soft tissues which decreases joint stiffness and relieves inflammation.
We
have recently successfully completed our first acquisition of “Sustainable Origins” which is an eco-friendly ESG company,
that converts used cooking oil to reusable biodiesel. This acquisition is part of our ongoing strategic plan for future revenue and expansion.
While our primary focus will always be revolving around the innovation of wearable technology, these projects will take time to market.
We want to align ourselves with like-minded Entrepreneurs that will mesh well with our team and collective interest. Having the ability
to acquire companies current operations to generate steady revenue streams, will also help aid in financing the production of “WarmUp”
and other products we will develop.

Critical
Accounting Estimates and Policies
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period.  Note 1 to the Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of
the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes.  Actual results could differ materially
from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates
used in the preparation of the Financial Statements.
We
are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business.  We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment
of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies.
An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  We regularly evaluate current information available to
us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.
We
recognize deferred tax assets (future tax benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.  The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent
the expected future tax return consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets
and liabilities are recovered or settled.  Future tax benefits have been fully offset by a 100% valuation allowance as management
is unable to determine that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized.
Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”) that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation,
they concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2022.
In
designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs.
Changes
in Internal Controls
Based
on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that no change occurred in the Company's internal
controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.
