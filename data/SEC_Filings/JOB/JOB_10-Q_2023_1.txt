Exhibits   24   Signatures   25       2 Table of Contents   CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS   As a matter of policy, the Company does not provide forecasts of future financial performance. The statements made in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements often contain or are prefaced by words such as "believe", "will" and "expect." These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our business based, in part, on assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result of a number of factors, our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Certain factors that might cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the negative effects of the Coronavirus Pandemic (“COVID-19”), including uncertainties regarding economic recovery and changed socioeconomic norms, general business conditions, the demand for the Company's services, competitive market pressures, the ability of the Company to attract and retain qualified personnel for regular full-time placement and contract assignments, the possibility of incurring liability for the Company's business activities, including the activities of its contract employees and events affecting its contract employees on client premises, cyber risks, including network security intrusions and/or loss of information, and the ability to attract and retain qualified corporate and branch management, as well as those risks discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, and in other documents which we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. See additional risk factors included below in Part II – Other Information, Item 1A. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) and does not intend to update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.     3 Table of Contents   Part I -FINANCIAL INFORMATION   ITEM 1.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)   1. B asis of Presentation   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending September 30, 2023. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 as filed on December 20, 2022.
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year’s condensed consolidated financial statements and/or related disclosures to conform to the current year’s presentation.   2. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Falloffs   Direct hire placement service revenues from contracts with customers are recognized when employment candidates accept offers of employment, less a provision for estimated credits or refunds to customers as the result of applicants not remaining employed for the entirety of the Company’s guarantee period (referred to as “falloffs”). The Company’s guarantee periods for permanently placed employees generally range from 60 to 90 days from the date of hire.
Falloffs and refunds during the period are reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations as a reduction of placement service revenues and were approximately $ 165
and $ 694
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Expected future falloffs and refunds are estimated and reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of accounts receivable as described below.   An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to bad debt expense where collection is considered to be doubtful due to credit issues. The Company charges off uncollectible accounts against the allowance once the invoices are deemed unlikely to be collectible. An allowance for placement falloffs also is recorded as a reduction of revenues for estimated losses due to applicants not remaining employed for the Company’s guarantee period. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 the allowance for doubtful accounts and falloffs was $ 731
and $ 738 , respectively. The allowance includes $ 575
and $ 548
for doubtful accounts and $ 156
and $ 190
for falloffs as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively.   3. Advertising Expenses   The Company expenses the costs of print and internet media advertising and promotions as incurred and reports these costs in selling, general and administrative expenses. For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, advertising expense totaled $ 581
and $ 518 , respectively.   4. Earnings per Share   Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares may consist of incremental shares issuable upon the vesting of restricted shares granted but unissued, exercise of stock options and warrants. The dilutive effect of the common stock equivalents is reflected in earnings per share by use of the treasury stock method.
For the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the weighted average dilutive incremental shares, or common stock equivalents, included in the calculations of dilutive shares were
816
and
1,442 , respectively. Common stock equivalents, which are excluded because their effect is anti-dilutive, were approximately
3,373
and
1,748
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.     8 Table of Contents   G EE GROUP INC.

7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets   Goodwill   The Company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment assessment, as of September 30, 2022, and determined that its goodwill was not impaired. Prior to this, as of December 31, 2021, an assessment showed the amount of discount inherent in the Company’s market capitalization as reported on the NYSE American exchange when compared with consolidated stockholders’ equity, or net book value, had increased since the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2021; therefore, the Company performed an interim assessment of its goodwill for impairment. The estimated fair values of its Professional Services and Industrial Services reporting units were adjusted based on qualitative and quantitative analysis so that they reconcile more precisely with the Company’s market capitalization as of December 31, 2021, plus an assumed control premium. As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $ 2,150
during the three months ended December 31, 2021. No impairment was recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2022.     10 Table of Contents   G EE GROUP INC.

Senior Bank Loan, Security and Guarantee Agreement   On May 14, 2021, the Company and its subsidiaries entered a Loan, Security and Guaranty Agreement for a $ 20
million asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility with CIT Bank, N.A. The CIT Facility is collateralized by 100% of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries who are co-borrowers and/or guarantors. The CIT Facility matures on the fifth anniversary of the closing date ( May 14, 2026 ).
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding borrowings and $ 13,029
available for borrowing under the terms of the CIT Facility. The Company also had $ 522
in unamortized debt issue cost associated with the CIT Facility. The amortization expense of these debt costs totaled $ 38
for both the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Under the CIT Facility, advances will be subject to a borrowing base formula that is computed based on 85% of eligible accounts receivable of the Company and subsidiaries as defined in the CIT Facility, and subject to certain other criteria, conditions, and applicable reserves, including any additional eligibility requirements as determined by the administrative agent. The CIT Facility is subject to usual and customary covenants and events of default for credit facilities of this type. The interest rate, at the Company’s election, will be based on either the Base Rate, as defined, plus the applicable margin; or the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), or any successor thereto, for the applicable interest period, subject to a 1% floor, plus the applicable margin. The CIT Facility also contains provisions addressing the future replacement of LIBOR utilized and referenced in the loan agreement, which will be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) in July 2023. SOFR is a secured, risk-free rate based on the cost of borrowing overnight. In addition to interest costs on advances outstanding, the CIT Facility will provide for an unused line fee ranging from
0.375 % to
0.50 % depending on the amount of undrawn credit, original issue discount and certain fees for diligence, implementation, and administration. The unused line fees incurred and included in interest expense totaled $ 26
for both the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   9. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) Payroll Protection Program Loans   During April and May 2020, the Company obtained Payroll Protection Program loans (“PPP loans”) for each of its operating subsidiaries. The PPP loans were used primarily to restore employee pay-cuts, recall furloughed or laid-off employees, support the payroll costs for existing employees, hire new employees, and for other allowable purposes including interest costs on certain business mortgage obligations, rent and utilities. Each of the Company’s subsidiaries executed a separate promissory note evidencing unsecured loans under the PPP.
11 Table of Contents   G EE GROUP INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)    The Company and its operating subsidiaries have been granted forgiveness of their respective PPP loans by the SBA. During fiscal 2021, the PPP loans and interest were forgiven for Access Data Consulting Corporation, Agile Resources, Inc., Scribe Solutions Inc., Triad Logistics, Inc., and Triad Personnel Services, Inc., in the amounts of $ 1,470 , $ 1,220 , $ 279 , $ 79 , and $ 408 , respectively, which were recognized as aggregate gains at that time. The Company’s remaining four PPP loans and interest for GEE Group Inc., BMCH, Inc., Paladin Consulting, Inc., and SNI Companies, Inc. were forgiven in December 2021 in the amounts of $ 2,024 , $ 2,630 , $ 1,956 , and $ 10,163 , respectively. As a result, the Company recognized aggregate gains of $ 16,773
during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The former PPP loans obtained by GEE Group Inc., and its operating subsidiaries together as an affiliated group, exceeded the $ 2,000
audit threshold established by the SBA, and therefore, will be subject to audit by the SBA in the future. If any of the nine forgiven PPP loans are reinstated in whole or in part as the result of a future audit, a charge or charges would be incurred, accordingly, and they would need to be repaid. If the companies are unable to repay the portions of their PPP loans that ultimately may be reinstated from available liquidity or operating cash flow, we may be required to raise additional equity or debt capital to repay the PPP loans.   10. Share-based Compensation   Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended   As of December 31, 2022, there were shares of restricted stock and stock options outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended (“Incentive Stock Plan”). During fiscal 2021, the Incentive Stock Plan was amended to increase the total shares available for restricted stock and stock options grants by
10,000
to a total of
15,000
( 7,500
restricted stock shares and
7,500
stock option shares). The Incentive Stock Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to grant either incentive or non-statutory stock options to employees. Vesting periods are established by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant. As of December 31, 2022, there were
8,760
shares available to be granted under the Plan ( 4,098
shares available for restricted stock grants and

shares available for stock option grants).   Restricted Stock   The Company granted 760 shares of restricted stock during the three months ended December 31, 2022. On September 27, 2022, the Company adopted a new annual incentive compensation program (“AICP”) for its executives to be administered under the Company’s Incentive Stock Plan. The AICP includes a long term incentive (“LTI”) compensation plan in the form of restricted stock awards comprised of two components: one that vests based on future service only, and a second that vests based on future service and performance. Initial awards under both service-only and service plus performance-based components of the AICP LTI plan are determined based on financial performance measures for the immediately preceding fiscal year. During the three months ended December 31, 2022,
551
of the
760
restricted shares were granted based on actual results for fiscal 2022, as measured against corresponding financial targets for that year, and will cliff vest as of December 2, 2025.
The remaining 209 of the 760 restricted shares were also granted based on fiscal 2022 results, and as further adjusted for the probable outcome with regard to the financial targets set by the Company’s board of directors for fiscal 2023. These restricted shares are subject to adjustment over their corresponding fiscal 2023 reporting period, based on probability of achieving the fiscal 2023 performance conditions. The final number of fiscal 2022 service plus performance-based restricted shares granted will be determined once the actual financial performance of the Company is determined for fiscal 2023, and will cliff vest on December 2, 2025, the third anniversary from their date of grant.     12 Table of Contents   G EE GROUP INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)    Under the AICP LTI plan, the service plus performance-based grants of 209 restricted shares during the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, represent the first tranche of a three-year schedule of awards. The next two tranches of up to 262 shares each (up to an additional 524 restricted shares in total) are scheduled to become effective as the Company’s financial plans and targets are set by the board of directors prior to each anniversary date for each of the two subsequent fiscal years, respectively. As the vesting of the two subsequent tranches will be based in part on performance conditions that have not yet been determined, the grant dates and fair values of these scheduled awards will be established in the future. The end of the requisite service periods for the entire 760 restricted shares granted during the three months ended December 30, 2022, plus the additional 524 restricted shares eligible to be granted in the future, once the performance conditions are determined for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, is December 2, 2025. Therefore, the remaining two tranches of the fiscal 2022 service plus performance-based awards may be expected to have grant dates corresponding with the establishment of the fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 financial performance targets by the Company’s board of directors. However, all final shares determined for each of the two subsequent annual tranches also will cliff vest on December 2, 2025.     Share-based compensation expense attributable to restricted stock was $ 87
and $ 72
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, there was approximately $ 882
of unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock outstanding and the weighted average vesting period for those grants was

Income Tax   The following table presents the provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:       Three Months Ended, December 31,       2022     2021   Provision for income taxes     73       ( 29 ) Effective tax rate     10 %     0 %   The effective income tax rate on operations is based upon the estimated income for the year, and adjustments, if any, in the applicable quarterly periods for the potential tax consequences, benefits, resolutions of tax audits or other tax contingencies.   The effective tax rates for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the effect of the change in valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset (“DTA”) position. Other than the deferred tax liability relating to indefinite lived assets, the Company is maintaining a valuation allowance against the remaining net DTA position.   12. Commitments and Contingencies   Litigation and Claims   The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business. There are no pending significant legal proceedings to which the Company is a party for which management believes the ultimate outcome would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.

Ended December 31,                   2022     2021     Change     Change   Professional contract services   $ 31,783     $ 32,595     $ (812)     -2% Industrial contract services     3,618       4,089       (471)     -12% Total professional and industrial contract services     35,401       36,684       (1,283)     -3%                                   Direct hire placement services     5,747       6,163       (416)     -7% Consolidated net revenues   $ 41,148     $ 42,847     $ (1,699)     -4%   Contract staffing services contributed $35,401 or approximately 86% of consolidated revenue and direct hire placement services contributed $5,747, or approximately 14%, of consolidated revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022. This compares to contract staffing services revenue of $36,684, or approximately 86%, of consolidated revenue and direct hire placement revenue of $6,163, or approximately 14%, of consolidated revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2021.   The net decrease in professional contract services revenues of $812, or 2%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, was attributable to completion of certain significant discreet projects as the three-month period ended December 31, 2021 included revenue for staffing support provided to vaccination and testing facilities related to COVID-19 and its variants which have since downsized or closed. These discreet projects generated $2,325 in revenue during the three-month period ended December 31, 2021. Excluding the effects of these discreet projects, professional contract services revenues would have increased $1,513, or 5%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Industrial staffing services for the quarter decreased by $471, or 12%, mainly due to a decrease in orders from clients. The industrial staffing markets continue to stabilize after the effects of COVID-19; however, competition for orders and temporary labor to fill orders also has increased.
Direct hire placement revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $416, or approximately 7%, over the three months ended December 31, 2021. Demand for the Company’s direct hire services decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2022, in part, due to a slowing in permanent placement orders from clients as economic uncertainties linger, including some predictions of a potential recession. It also is noteworthy that our 2022 fiscal year, which included the three months ended December 31, 2021, set a record of being one of our highest ever in terms of direct hire revenues.   Cost of Contract Services   Cost of contract services includes wages and related payroll taxes and employee benefits of the Company's contract services employees, and certain other contract employee-related costs, while working on contract assignments. Cost of contract services for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by approximately 2% to $26,757 compared to $27,265 for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The $508 overall decrease in cost of contract services is consistent with the decrease in revenues as discussed above.     17 Table of Contents   (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)    Gross Profit percentage by service:                               Three Months       Ended December 31,       2022     2021   Professional contract services     25.4%     27.0% Industrial contract services     15.5%     15.3% Professional and industrial services combined     24.4%     25.7%                   Direct hire placement services     100.0%     100.0% Combined gross profit margin (1)     35.0%     36.4%   (1) Includes gross profit from direct hire placements, for which all associated costs are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses.
The Company’s combined gross profit margin, including direct hire placement services (recorded at 100% gross margin) for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 35.0% as compared with approximately 36.4% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2021.
In the professional contract staffing services segment, the gross margin (excluding direct placement services) was approximately 25.4% for three-month period ended December 31, 2022 as compared with approximately 27.0% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2021. This is due in part to increases in contractor pay associated with the recent rise in inflation resulting in some spread compression. The Company has stepped-up counter-inflationary increases in bill rates and spreads where possible in response to this margin compression.   The Company’s industrial staffing services gross margin for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 15.5% versus approximately 15.3% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2021. Gross profit for the Company’s industrial staffing services segment for the three months ended December 31, 2021 includes $18 of annual premium refunds from the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation insurance programs, while the three months ended December 31, 2022 did not include any refunds. The Industrial Services gross margin excluding the effect of these refunds and distributions was approximately 14.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase, excluding the effects of the workers compensation premium refunds and distributions, is mainly attributable to an increase in rates enacted to offset increases in contractor payroll, leading to a higher spread in the Industrial Segment.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) include the following categories:     • Compensation and benefits in the operating divisions, which includes salaries, wages and commissions earned by the Company’s employment consultants, recruiters and branch managers on permanent and temporary placements;         • Administrative compensation, which includes salaries, wages, share-based compensation, payroll taxes, and employee benefits associated with general management and the operation of corporate functions, including principally, finance, human resources, information technology and administrative functions;         • Occupancy costs, which includes office rent, and other office operating expenses;       • Recruitment advertising, which includes the cost of identifying and tracking job applicants; and         • Other selling, general and administrative expenses, which includes travel, bad debt expense, fees for outside professional services and other corporate-level expenses such as business insurance and taxes.     18 Table of Contents   (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)    The Company’s SG&A for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $449 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. SG&A for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as a percentage of revenues, was approximately 31% compared to approximately 29% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to additional incentive compensation and awards for producers related to recent performance.   SG&A also includes certain non-cash costs and expenses incurred related to acquisition, integration, restructuring and other non-recurring activities, such as certain corporate legal and general expenses associated with capital markets activities, that either are not directly associated with core business operations or have been eliminated on a going forward basis. These costs were estimated to be $44 and $526 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and include mainly expenses associated with former closed and consolidated locations, and personnel costs associated with eliminated positions.   Depreciation Expense   Depreciation expense was $101 and $86 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The increase in depreciation expense is due to recent net additions to fixed assets.     Amortization Expense   Amortization expense was $720 and $1,014 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease is due to intangible assets related to certain non-compete agreements and trade names becoming fully amortized.   Goodwill Impairment   The Company recently completed its annual goodwill impairment assessment, as of September 30, 2022, and determined that its goodwill was not impaired. As of December 31, 2021, the Company performed an interim assessment of its goodwill for impairment and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $2,150 during the three months ended December 31, 2021.   Income (Loss) from Operations   The income (loss) from operations was $762 and $(27) for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This increase of $789 is mainly attributable to the non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $2,150 impacting results for the three months ended December 31, 2021, offset as a result of the combination of matters in regards to the Company’s revenues, costs and expenses as discussed above.
Gain on Extinguishment of Debt   The Company recorded a gain of $16,773 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 related to forgiveness and extinguishment of its remaining PPP loans and accrued interest.
Interest Expense   Interest expense was $73 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, which decreased by $34 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in interest expense is mainly attributable to the three months ending December 31, 2021 including interest of $32 on the Company’s remaining PPP loans which were forgiven during that quarter.     19 Table of Contents   (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)    Interest Income   The Company began holding cash in a money market account in August 2022 on which interest has since been earned on a monthly basis. Interest income earned from this account was $38 for the three months ended December 31, 2022.   Provision for Income Taxes   The Company recognized income tax expense (benefits) of $73 and $(29) for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the effect of the change in valuation allowance on the net DTA position.
Net Income   The Company’s net income was $654 and $16,668 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in net income is mainly attributable to gains of $16,773 from extinguishment of the Company’s remaining PPP loans, offset by a $2,150 non-cash goodwill impairment charge during the three months ended December 31, 2021. The remaining net decrease of $1,391 is consistent with the decrease in gross profit and gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021, as explained in the preceding paragraphs.
20 Table of Contents   (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)    Liquidity and Capital Resources   The primary sources of liquidity for the Company are revenues earned and collected from its clients for the placement of contract employees and independent contractors on a temporary basis and permanent employment candidates and borrowings available under its asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility. Uses of liquidity include primarily the costs and expenses necessary to fund operations, including payment of compensation to the Company’s contract and permanent employees, and employment-related expenses, operating costs and expenses, taxes and capital expenditures.   The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of cash flows data:       Three Months
Ended December 31,       2022     2021   Cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities   $ (326)   $ 2,264   Cash flows used in investing activities   $ (50)   $ (84) Cash flows used in financing activities   $ -     $ -     As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $18,472 of cash, which was a decrease of $376 from $18,848 as of September 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had working capital of $28,536 compared to $26,643 of working capital as of September 30, 2022. The increase in working capital is mainly attributable to the final installment of deferred payroll taxes under the CARES Act being paid and annual incentive compensation payments during the three months ended December 31, 2022, which were reflected in current liabilities in the aggregate amount of $3,027 as of September 30, 2022. These payments also account for corresponding reductions in cash flows provided by operating activities and ending cash as of December 31, 2022.   The primary uses of cash for investing activities were for the acquisition of property and equipment in the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   There were no cash flows used in financing activities for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   The Company had approximately $13,029 in availability for borrowings under its CIT Facility as of December 31, 2022. There were no outstanding borrowings on the CIT Facility as of December 31, 2022, or September 30, 2022, except for certain accrued carrying fees and costs, which are included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.   All the Company’s office facilities are leased. Minimum lease payments under all the Company’s lease agreements for the twelve-month period commencing after the close of business on December 31, 2022, are approximately $1,449. There are no minimum debt service principal payments due during the twelve-month period commencing after the close of business on December 31, 2022.   Management believes that the Company can generate adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the foreseeable future and at least for the next twelve months.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   As of December 31, 2022, there were no transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements to which an unconsolidated entity was a party, under which the Company (a) had any direct or contingent obligation under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest in the unconsolidated entity, or (b) had a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to the unconsolidated entity.     21 Table of Contents   (Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)    Item 3.
