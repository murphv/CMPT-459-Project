(In thousands, except share and per share amounts) 1.
Organization Hamilton Lane Incorporated (“HLI”) is a holding company whose principal asset is a controlling equity interest in Hamilton Lane Advisors, L.L.C. (“HLA”). As the sole managing member of HLA, HLI operates and controls all of the business and affairs of HLA, and through HLA, conducts its business. As a result, HLI consolidates HLA’s financial results and reports a non-controlling interest related to the portion of HLA units not owned by HLI. The assets and liabilities of HLA represent substantially all of HLI’s consolidated assets and liabilities with the exception of certain cash, certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, payable to related parties pursuant to a tax receivable agreement, and dividends payable. Unless otherwise specified, “the Company” refers to the consolidated entity of HLI, HLA and subsidiaries throughout the remainder of these notes. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, HLI held approximately
69.0 % and
68.9 %, respectively, of the economic interest in HLA. As future exchanges of HLA units occur pursuant to the exchange agreement in place with HLA’s members, the economic interest in HLA held by HLI will increase.
HLA is a registered investment advisor with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), providing asset management and advisory services, primarily to institutional investors, to design, build and manage private markets portfolios. HLA generates revenues primarily from management fees, by managing assets on behalf of customized separate accounts, specialized fund products and distribution management accounts, and advisory fees, by providing asset supervisory and reporting services.
HLA sponsors the formation, and serves as the general partner or managing member, of various limited liability partnerships consisting of specialized funds and certain single client separate account entities (“Partnerships”) that acquire interests in third-party managed investment funds that make private equity and equity-related investments. The Partnerships may also make direct investments, including investments in debt, equity, and other equity-based instruments. The Company, which includes certain subsidiaries that serve as the general partner or managing member of the Partnerships, may invest its own capital in the Partnerships and generally makes all investment and operating decisions for the Partnerships. HLA operates several wholly-owned entities through which it conducts its foreign operations. 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Management believes it has made all necessary adjustments (which consisted of only normal recurring items) so that the condensed consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and that estimates made in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent. Results of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending March 31, 2023. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in HLI’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.

(In thousands, except share and per share amounts) Accounting for Differing Fiscal Periods
The Partnerships primarily have a fiscal year end as of December 31, and the Company accounts for its investments in the Partnerships using a three-month lag due to the timing of financial information received from the investments held by the Partnerships. The Partnerships primarily invest in private equity funds, which generally require at least 90 days following the calendar year end to present audited financial statements. The Company records its share of capital contributions to and distributions from the Partnerships in investments in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets during the three-month lag period. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company utilizes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach, and cost approach). The levels of the hierarchy are described below: • Level 1: Values are determined using quoted market prices for identical financial instruments in an active market.
• Level 2: Values are determined using quoted prices for similar financial instruments and valuation models whose inputs are observable.
• Level 3:
V alues are determined using pricing models that use significant inputs that are primarily unobservable, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, fees receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. The amendments in this update clarify the guidance in Topic 820 when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual sale restrictions and introduce new disclosure requirements related to such equity securities. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements. Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 3.

Investments Investments consist of the following: December 31, March 31, 2022 2022 Equity method investments in Partnerships $ 328,311   $ 326,296   Other equity method investments —   1,573 Other investments 20,189   19,820 Investments valued under the measurement alternative 165,832   156,100 Total Investments $ 514,332   $ 503,789   Equity method investments The Company’s equity method investments in Partnerships represent its ownership in certain specialized funds and customized separate accounts. The strategies and geographic location of investments within the Partnerships vary by fund. The Company has a
1 % interest in substantially all of the Partnerships.
During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company sold its ownership interests in its joint venture that automates the collection of fund and underlying portfolio company data from general partners, Private Markets Connect, for $ 10,000
and recognized a gain of $ 9,783
which is recorded in non-operating (expense) income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Immediately preceding the sale, the Company received a distribution from the joint venture of $ 1,406 .
11 Hamilton Lane Incorporated Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts) Other investments The Company’s other investments represent a publicly traded security and investments in private equity funds and direct credit and equity investments that are held as collateral on the Company’s secured financing. The private equity fund investments can only be redeemed through distributions received from the liquidation of underlying investments of the fund, and the timing of distributions is currently indeterminable. The direct credit investments are debt securities classified as trading securities. Other investments are measured at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded in non-operating (expense) income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company accounts for its secured financing at fair value under the fair value option. The primary reason for electing the fair value option is to mitigate volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes. The significant input to the fair value of the secured financing is the fair value of the other investments delivered as collateral which are estimated using Level 3 inputs with the significant inputs as shown in Note 5 below. The Company recognized a gain on other investments held as collateral of $ 821
and $ 915
during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and a gain of $ 2,288
and $ 3,239
during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively, that are recorded in non-operating (expense) income. The Company recognized a loss on the secured financing liability of $ 821
and
$ 915
during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and a loss of $ 2,288
and $ 3,239
during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively, that are recorded in non-operating (expense) income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Investments valued under the measurement alternative During the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Company made investments in
two
private companies. The Company invested $ 3,000
in a technology driven platform that provides a digitized token for investors that improves the efficiency of capital raises. Additionally, the Company invested $ 12,000
in an online financial services platform. Due to the lack of readily determinable fair values for these investments, over which the Company does not have significant influence, the Company values the investments under the measurement alternative. During the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Company made an additional investment of $ 5,236
in a company that maintains a platform of solutions designed to aid individual investors and various wealth management platforms with their wealth management needs.
As a result of the transaction, the Company marked its original investment to fair value based upon the transaction price, which resulted in total unrealized gain of $ 6,687
during the three months ended June 30, 2022, that is recorded in non-operating (expense) income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Due to the lack of readily determinable fair value for this investment, over which the Company does not have significant influence, the Company will continue to value the investment under the measurement alternative. During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company made investments in
two
private companies. The Company invested $ 3,000
in a digital platform that offers financial planning and portfolio management tools to retail and accredited investors. The Company invested $ 4,000
in a cloud-based treasury and liquidity solution for investment management firms. Due to the lack of readily determinable fair values for these investments, over which the Company does not have significant influence, the Company will value the investments under the measurement alternative. 12 Hamilton Lane Incorporated Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts) During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company made additional investments in
three
private companies in which it previously invested. The Company invested an additional $ 1,228
in a cloud-based treasury and liquidity solution for investment management firms. The Company invested an additional $ 5,061
in a company that provides environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) reporting metrics and analysis to private market firms and private companies. As a result of the transaction, the Company marked its original investment to fair value based upon the transaction price, which resulted in a total unrealized gain of $ 11,521
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that is recorded in non-operating (expense) income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company invested an additional $ 600
in a technology company that has developed software to automate manual data entry tasks associated with alternative investment reporting. As part of that funding round, a convertible note issued by the investee to the Company converted into additional shares of the investee with a value of $ 550 . Due to the lack of readily determinable fair values for these investments, over which the Company does not have significant influence, the Company will continue to value these investments under the measurement alternative. The Company performs qualitative impairment assessments at each quarter end on its investments recorded under the measurement alternative. As a result of this assessment as of December 31, 2022, the Company determined that a quantitative assessment was required to be performed for one of its investments given a significant decrease in earnings performance and overall economic and market conditions. The assessment indicated that the fair value was less than the carrying value at December 31, 2022. Prior to the impairment recorded, the carrying value of the investment was $ 74,189 . The impairment amount was $ 43,289
and is included in non-operating (expense) income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value was estimated using Level 3 inputs with the significant input as shown in Note 5 below. 5.

Acquisitions On April 1, 2021, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of 361 Capital, LLC for a total aggregate cash amount of $ 13,096 , of which $ 10,096
was paid on the closing date of the acquisition. The remaining $ 3,000
will be paid in
two
equal installments on the first and second anniversaries of the closing. On April 1, 2022, the Company paid the first of the two equal installments. The purchase price based upon the fair value of consideration transferred at the date of acquisition is $ 12,946 . The Company recorded $ 7,145
of definite lived intangible assets related primarily to the acquired investment management contracts, which will be amortized over
seven years , and $ 5,623
of goodwill, which are both recorded in other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining assets acquired and liabilities assumed are not material to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Revenue and net income attributable to the acquisition of 361 Capital, LLC were not material for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and therefore, pro forma information related to this acquisition is not presented. In December 2022, the Company finalized the transfer of the advisory arrangement to a third party for an agreed upon percentage of the respective funds’ management fees over two calendar years. The Company recognized a gain of $ 2,771
on the sale of the advisory agreements that is recorded in non-operating (expense) income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 7.
Variable Interest Entities The Company consolidates certain variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which it is determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary.
Consolidated Variable Interest Entities The Company consolidates general partner entities of certain Partnerships and a Partnership in which it is currently the primary beneficiary, which are not wholly-owned by the Company.
The total assets of these consolidated VIEs are $ 41,498
and $ 10,036
as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.
The consolidated VIEs had
no
liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022.
The assets of the consolidated general partner VIEs represent equity method-investments in direct investment funds and customized separate accounts and the assets of the consolidated Partnership VIE represent cash and direct credit investments. The assets may only be used to settle obligations of the respective consolidated VIEs, if any.
In addition, there is no recourse to the Company for the consolidated VIEs’ liabilities, except for certain entities in which there could be a clawback of previously distributed carried interest. The Company previously sponsored and consolidated Hamilton Lane Alliance Holdings I, Inc. (“HLAH”) through HL Alliance Holdings Sponsor LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On January 15, 2021, HLAH completed an IPO raising total gross proceeds of $ 276,000 , which were placed in a trust and could only be utilized for funding a business combination or the redemption of Class A shares of HLAH. In a private placement concurrent with the IPO, HLAH sold warrants to HL Alliance Holdings Sponsor LLC for gross proceeds of $ 7,520 , which were used by HLAH to pay the offering costs and also to provide working capital. On December 15, 2022, HLAH was liquidated, as it was determined that HLAH would be unable to consummate an initial business combination within the time period required by its governing documents. In connection with the liquidation, HLAH redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock, cancelled all of the outstanding public and private warrants and settled all other outstanding liabilities.
16 Hamilton Lane Incorporated Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts) Nonconsolidated Variable Interest Entities The Company holds variable interests in certain Partnerships that are VIEs, which are not consolidated, as it is determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary based upon the Company’s equity interest percentage in each of the VIEs.
Certain Partnerships are considered VIEs because limited partners lack the ability to remove the general partner or dissolve the entity without cause, by simple majority vote (i.e. do not have substantive “kick out” or “liquidation” rights).
The Company’s involvement with such entities is in the form of direct equity interests in, and fee arrangements with, the Partnerships in which it also serves as the general partner or managing member. In the Company’s role as general partner or managing member, it generally considers itself the sponsor of the applicable Partnership and makes all investment and operating decisions. As of December 31, 2022, the total remaining unfunded commitments from the Company’s general partner entities to the nonconsolidated VIEs was $ 140,691 . Investor commitments are the primary source of financing for the nonconsolidated VIEs. The maximum exposure to loss represents the potential loss of assets recognized by the Company relating to these nonconsolidated entities. The Company believes that its maximum exposure to loss is limited because it establishes separate limited partnerships or limited liability companies to serve as the general partner or managing member of the Partnerships. The carrying value of assets and liabilities recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet related to the Company’s interests in these nonconsolidated VIEs and the Company’s maximum exposure to loss relating to non-consolidated VIEs were as follows: December 31, March 31, 2022 2022 Investments $ 190,735   $ 191,378   Fees receivable 16,418   9,754   Due from related parties 1,901   778   Total VIE Assets 209,054   201,910   Less: Non-controlling interests ( 1,534 ) ( 1,873 ) Maximum exposure to loss $ 207,520   $ 200,037   8.
Debt The Company’s debt consisted of the following: As of December 31, 2022 As of March 31, 2022 Principal Outstanding Carrying Value Interest Rate Principal Outstanding Carrying Value Interest Rate Term Loan $ 100,000   $ 99,578   6.25   % $ 71,754   $ 71,574   2.25   % 2020 Multi-Draw Facility 100,000   99,548   3.50   % 100,000   99,752   3.50   % Total Debt $ 200,000   $ 199,126   $ 171,754   $ 171,326   In October 2022, the Company modified its existing credit facility with its lender. The modifications took the form of a new 2022 Multi-Draw Term Loan and Security Agreement, as well as amendments to the existing Revolving Loan and Security Agreement, Term Loan and Security Agreement and 2020 Multi-Draw Term Loan and Security Agreement (collectively, the “Loan Agreements”). 17 Hamilton Lane Incorporated Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts) The modifications extended maturity dates of the Loan Agreements, increased the principal outstanding under the term loan to $ 100,000
and added borrowing capacity across the Loan Agreements, subject to an overall cap of $ 325,000
of loan principal outstanding. The facility is secured by substantially all of HLA’s personal property assets, subject to certain excluded assets. The Loan Agreements contain financial and operational covenants, events of default and remedies that the Company believes to be customary.
The carrying value of the Company’s outstanding debt as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 approximated fair value except for the 2020 multi-draw facility which had an estimated fair value of $ 86,782
as of December 31, 2022. The estimated fair value of debt is based on then-current market rates for similar debt instruments and is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

18 Hamilton Lane Incorporated Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts) Performance Awards The Company granted performance stock awards to certain employees that are subject to both a market-based vesting and a service-based vesting condition (“Performance Awards”). The Performance Awards will vest based upon (i) the market price of HLI Class A common stock achieving certain price thresholds from $ 150
per share to $ 230
per share and (ii) continued employment through the date the price target is met (with a minimum of
five years
of service required after the grant date for vesting). If the price target is met prior to the fifth anniversary of the grant date, the vesting date will be the fifth anniversary of the grant date. Holders of the Performance Awards do not participate in dividends until such awards have met both their market-based and service-based vesting requirements.
Due to the existence of the service requirement, the vesting period for these awards will vary with each respective tranche as the employees must be employed with the Company at the point in which the market requirement is met with a minimum of
five years
of service required after the grant date for vesting. As such, compensation expense will be recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the grant date to the end for the employee’s service period. The fair value of the awards granted are based on a Monte-Carlo simulation valuation model.
A summary of Performance Award activity for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 is presented below: Total Unvested Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value of Award March 31, 2022 —   $ —   Granted
528,282   $ 29.79   Vested —   $ —   Forfeited —   $ —   December 31, 2022 528,282   $ 29.79   Below is a summary of the grant date fair value based on the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model and the significant assumptions used to estimate the grant date fair value of the Performance Awards granted September 16, 2022:

Compensation and Benefits The Company has recorded the following amounts related to compensation and benefits: Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Base compensation and benefits $ 35,473   $ 29,340   $ 116,549   $ 79,014   Incentive fee compensation 7,368   2,953   34,870   9,308   Equity-based compensation 2,835   1,711   6,816   5,706   Total compensation and benefits $ 45,676   $ 34,004   $ 158,235   $ 94,028   12.
Income Tax The Company’s effective tax rate used for interim periods is based on an estimated annual effective tax rate including the tax effect of items required to be recorded discretely in the interim period in which those items occur.
The effective tax rate is dependent on many factors, including the estimated amount of income subject to income tax; therefore, the effective tax rate can vary from period to period. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis and adjusts the valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. The Company’s effective tax rate was
35.0 % and
22.2 % for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and
12.6 % and
15.2 % for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The effective tax rates were different from the statutory tax rates due to the portion of income allocated to non-controlling interests, valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and discrete tax adjustments recorded in the periods. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had
no
unrecognized tax positions and believes there will be no changes to uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months. 13.
Earnings per Share Shares of the Company’s Class B common stock do not share in the earnings or losses attributable to HLI, and, therefore, are not participating securities. As a result, a separate presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock under the two-class method has not been included. Shares of the Company’s Class B common stock are, however, considered potentially dilutive to the Class A common stock because the Class B units to which the Class B common stock corresponds are exchangeable for shares of Class A common stock on a
one -for-one basis, at which time the share of Class B common stock is surrendered in exchange for a payment of its par value. 20 Hamilton Lane Incorporated Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Commitments and Contigencies Litigation In the ordinary course of business, the Company may be subject to various legal, regulatory, and/or administrative proceedings from time to time. Although there can be no assurance of the outcome of such proceedings, in the opinion of management, the Company does not believe it is probable that any pending or, to its knowledge, threatened legal proceeding or claim would individually or in the aggregate materially affect its condensed consolidated financial statements. Incentive Fees The Partnerships have allocated carried interest still subject to contingencies and did not meet the Company’s criteria for revenue recognition in the amounts of $ 952,188
and $ 1,191,066 , net of amounts attributable to non-controlling interests, at December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. If the Company ultimately receives the unrecognized carried interest, a total of $ 238,047
and $ 297,766
as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively, would potentially be payable to certain employees and third parties pursuant to compensation arrangements related to carried interest profit-sharing plans. Such amounts have not been recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets or Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as the payment is not yet probable. Commitments The Company serves as the investment manager of the Partnerships. The general partner or managing member of each Partnership is generally a separate subsidiary of the Company and has agreed to invest funds on the same basis as the limited partners in most instances. The Company’s aggregate unfunded commitment to the Partnerships was $ 212,895
and $ 186,164
as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The Company has an unrealized net gain on its investments valued under the measurement alternative of $ 29,004
as of December 31, 2022, of which up to
15 % may be paid as a discretionary bonus as those gains are realized. Leases The Company’s leases consist primarily of operating leases for office space and office equipment in various locations around the world. Some leases have the option to extend for an additional term or terminate early. Short-term lease costs are not material . 23 Hamilton Lane Incorporated Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Business Overview We are a global private markets investment solutions provider and operate our business in a single segment. We offer a variety of investment solutions to address our clients’ needs across a range of private markets, including private equity, private credit, real estate, infrastructure, natural resources, growth equity, venture capital and impact. These solutions are constructed from a range of investment types, including primary investments in funds managed by third-party managers, direct investments alongside such funds and acquisitions of secondary stakes in such funds, with a number of our clients utilizing multiple investment types. These solutions are offered in a variety of formats covering some or all phases of private markets investment programs: • Customized Separate Accounts : We design and build customized portfolios of private markets funds and direct investments to meet our clients’ specific portfolio objectives with regard to return, risk tolerance, diversification and liquidity. We generally have discretionary investment authority over our customized separate accounts, which comprised approximately $81 billion of our assets under management (“AUM”) as of December 31, 2022.
• Specialized Funds : We organize, invest and manage specialized primary, secondary and direct investment funds. Our specialized funds invest across a variety of private markets and include equity, equity-linked and credit funds offered on standard terms as well as shorter duration, opportunistically oriented funds. We launched our first specialized fund in 1997. Since then, our product offerings have grown steadily and now include evergreen offerings that invest primarily in secondaries and direct investments in equity and credit and are available to certain high-net-worth individuals. Specialized funds comprised approximately $27 billion of our AUM as of December 31, 2022. • Advisory Services : We offer investment advisory services to assist clients in developing and implementing their private markets investment programs. Our investment advisory services include asset allocation, strategic plan creation, development of investment policies and guidelines, the screening and recommending of investments, legal negotiations, the monitoring of and reporting on investments and investment manager review and due diligence. Our advisory clients include some of the largest and most sophisticated private markets investors in the world. We had approximately $724 billion of assets under advisement (“AUA”) as of December 31, 2022. 25 • Distribution Management : We offer distribution management services to our clients through active portfolio management to enhance the realized value of publicly traded stock they receive as distributions in-kind from private equity funds.
• Reporting, Monitoring, Data and Analytics:
We provide our clients with comprehensive reporting and investment monitoring services, usually bundled into our broader investment solutions offerings, but also on a stand-alone, fee-for-service basis. We also provide comprehensive research and analytical services as part of our investment solutions, leveraging our large, global, proprietary and high-quality database for transparency and powerful analytics. Our data, as well as our benchmarking and forecasting models, are accessible through our proprietary technology solution, Cobalt LP, on a stand-alone, subscription basis. Our client and investor base is broadly diversified by type, size and geography. Our client base primarily comprises institutional investors that range from those seeking to make an initial investment in alternative assets to some of the world’s largest and most sophisticated private markets investors. As we offer a highly customized, flexible service, we are equipped to provide investment services to institutional clients of all sizes and with different needs, internal resources and investment objectives. Our clients include prominent institutional investors in the United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and Latin America. We provide private markets solutions and services to some of the largest global pension, sovereign wealth and U.S. state pension funds. In addition, we believe we are a leading provider of private markets solutions for U.S. labor union pension plans, and we serve numerous smaller public and corporate pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, financial institutions and insurance companies, endowments and foundations, as well as family offices and selected high-net-worth individuals.
Key Financial and Operating Measures Our key financial measures are discussed below.
Revenues We generate revenues primarily from management and advisory fees, and to a lesser extent, incentive fees. Management and advisory fees
comprise specialized fund and customized separate account management fees, advisory and reporting fees and distribution management fees.
Revenues from customized separate accounts are generally based on a contractual rate applied to committed capital or net invested capital under management. These fees often decrease over the life of the contract due to built-in declines in contractual rates and/or as a result of lower net invested capital balances as capital is returned to clients. In certain cases, we also provide advisory and/or reporting services, and, therefore, we also receive fees for services such as monitoring and reporting on a client’s existing private markets investments. In addition, we may provide for investments in our specialized funds as part of our customized separate accounts. In these cases, we generally reduce the management and/or incentive fees on customized separate accounts to the extent that assets in the accounts are invested in our specialized funds so that our clients do not pay duplicate fees. Revenues from specialized funds are based on a percentage of limited partners’ capital commitments to, net invested capital or net asset value in, our specialized funds. The management fee during the commitment period is often charged on capital commitments and after the commitment period (or a defined anniversary of the fund’s initial closing) is typically reduced by a percentage of the management fee for the preceding year or charged on net invested capital. In the case of certain funds, we charge
26 management fees on capital commitments, with the management fee increasing during the early years of the fund’s term and declining in the later years. Management fees for certain funds are discounted based on the amount of the limited partners’ commitments, whether the limited partners commit early in the offering period or if the limited partners are investors in our other funds.
Revenues from advisory and reporting services are generally annual fixed fees, which vary depending on the services we provide. In limited cases, advisory service clients are charged basis point fees annually based on the amounts they have committed to invest pursuant to their agreements with us. In other cases where our services are limited to monitoring and reporting on investment portfolios, clients are charged a fee based on the number of investments in their portfolio.
Distribution management fees are generally earned by applying a percentage to AUM or proceeds received. Certain active management clients may elect a fee structure under which they are charged an asset-based fee plus a fee based on net realized and unrealized gains and income net of realized and unrealized losses.
Incentive fees
comprise carried interest earned from our specialized funds and certain customized separate accounts structured as single-client funds in which we have a general partner commitment, and performance fees earned on certain other customized separate accounts. For each of our secondary funds, direct investment funds, strategic opportunity funds and evergreen funds, we generally earn carried interest equal to a fixed percentage of net profits, usually 10.0% to 12.5%, subject to a compounded annual preferred return that is generally 6.0% to 8.0%. To the extent that our primary funds also directly make secondary investments and direct investments, they generally earn carried interest on a similar basis. Furthermore, certain of our primary funds earn carried interest on their investments in other private markets funds on a primary basis that is generally 5.0% of net profits, subject to the fund’s compounded annual preferred return. We recognize carried interest when it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The primary contingency regarding incentive fees is the “clawback,” or the obligation to return distributions in excess of the amount prescribed by the applicable fund or separate account documents. Incentive fees are typically only required to be returned on a net of tax basis due to a clawback. As such, the tax-related portion of incentive fees is typically not subject to clawback and is therefore recognized as revenue immediately upon receipt. In the event that a payment is made before it can be recognized as revenue, this amount would be included as deferred incentive fee revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and recognized as income in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. Performance fees, which are a component of incentive fees, are based on the aggregate amount of realized gains earned by the applicable customized separate account, subject to the achievement of defined minimum returns to the clients. Performance fees range from 5.0% to 12.5% of net profits, subject to a compounded annual preferred return that varies by account but is generally 6.0% to 8.0%. Performance fees are recognized when the risk of clawback or reversal is not probable.
27 Expenses Compensation and benefits
is
our largest expense and consists of (a) base compensation comprising salary, bonuses and benefits paid and payable to employees, (b) equity-based compensation associated with the grants of restricted stock and performance awards and (c) incentive fee compensation, which consists of carried interest and performance fee allocations. We expect to continue to experience a general rise in compensation and benefits expense commensurate with expected growth in headcount and with the need to maintain competitive compensation levels as we expand geographically and create new products and services.
Our compensation arrangements with our employees contain a significant bonus component driven by the results of our operations. Therefore, as our revenues, profitability and the amount of incentive fees earned by our customized separate accounts and specialized funds increase, our compensation costs rise.
Certain current and former employees participate in a carried interest program whereby approximately 25% of incentive fees from certain of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts are awarded to plan participants. We record compensation expense payable to plan participants as the incentive fees become estimable and collection is probable.
General, administrative and other
includes travel, accounting, legal and other professional fees, commissions, placement fees, office expenses, depreciation and other costs associated with our operations. Our occupancy-related costs and professional services expenses, in particular, generally increase or decrease in relative proportion to the number of our employees and the overall size and scale of our business operations.
Other Income (Expense) Equity in income (loss) of investees
primarily
represents our share of earnings from our investments in our specialized funds and certain customized separate accounts in which we have a general partner commitment. Equity income primarily comprises our share of the net realized and unrealized gains (losses) and investment income partially offset by the expenses from these investments. We have general partner commitments in our specialized funds and certain customized separate accounts that invest solely in primary funds, secondary funds and direct investments, as well as those that invest across investment types. Equity in income (loss) of investees will increase or decrease as the change in underlying fund investment valuations increases or decreases. Since our direct investment funds invest in underlying portfolio companies, their quarterly and annual valuation changes are more affected by individual company movements than our primary and secondary funds that have exposures across multiple portfolio companies in underlying private markets funds. Our specialized funds and customized separate accounts invest across industries, strategies and geographies, and therefore our general partner investments do not include any significant concentrations in a specific sector or area outside the United States.
Interest expense
includes interest paid and accrued on our outstanding debt, along with the amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of original issue discount and the write-off of deferred financing costs due to the repayment of previously outstanding debt.
Interest income
is income earned on cash and cash equivalents.
Non-operating income (expense)
consists primarily of gains and losses on certain investments, changes in liability under the tax receivable agreement and other non-recurring or non-cash items. 28 Other income (expense) of consolidated Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”)
consists primarily of the share of earnings of investments of consolidated general partner entities, which are not wholly-owned by us, in our specialized funds and certain customized separate accounts in which they have a general partner commitment and interest income on investments held in trust and changes in fair value of liabilities of our sponsored special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”).
Income Tax Expense
We are a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and therefore are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes on our share of taxable income generated by HLA. Prior to our IPO, we operated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and therefore were not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. HLA is treated as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. As such, income generated by HLA flows through to its limited partners, including us, and is generally not subject to U.S. federal or state income tax at the partnership level. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries generally operate as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, with certain of these entities subject to non-U.S. income taxes. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to local jurisdiction income taxes at the entity level. Accordingly, the tax liability with respect to income attributable to non-controlling interests in HLA is borne by the holders of such non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests reflect the portion of income or loss and the corresponding equity attributable to third-party equity holders and employees in certain consolidated subsidiaries that are not 100% owned by us. Non-controlling interests are presented as separate components in our consolidated statements of income to clearly distinguish between our interests and the economic interests of third parties and employees in those entities. Fee-Earning AUM Fee-earning AUM is a metric we use to measure the assets from which we earn management fees. Our fee-earning AUM comprise assets in our customized separate accounts and specialized funds from which we derive management fees that are generally derived from applying a certain percentage to the appropriate fee base. We classify customized separate account revenue as management fees if the client is charged an asset-based fee, which includes the majority of our discretionary AUM accounts but also includes certain non-discretionary AUA accounts. Our fee-earning AUM is equal to the amount of capital commitments, net invested capital and net asset value (“NAV”) of our customized separate accounts and specialized funds depending on the fee terms. Substantially all of our customized separate accounts and specialized funds earn fees based on commitments or net invested capital, which are not affected by market appreciation or depreciation. Therefore, revenues and fee-earning AUM are not significantly affected by changes in market value.
Our calculations of fee-earning AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our definition of fee-earning AUM is not based on any definition that is set forth in the agreements governing the customized separate accounts or specialized funds that we manage. 29 Consolidated Results of Operations The following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Total revenues increased $35.4 million, or 39%, to $127.1 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to increases in both management and advisory fees and incentive fees. Management and advisory fees increased $17.5 million, or 22%, to $97.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Specialized funds revenue increased $15.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to a $5.3 million increase in revenue from our latest secondary fund, a $3.9 million increase in revenue from our evergreen funds, and a $3.5 million increase in revenue from our latest direct equity fund, which added $1.6 billion, $1.1 billion, and $0.9 billion, respectively, in fee-earning AUM between periods. Revenue from our latest secondary and direct equity funds included $2.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, in retroactive fees for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Retroactive fees are management fees earned in the current period from investors that commit to a specialized fund towards the end of the fundraising period and are required to pay a catch-up management fee as if they had committed to the fund at the first closing in a prior period. Customized separate accounts revenue increased $3.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 due to the addition of several new accounts and additional allocations from existing accounts. Distribution management revenue decreased $2.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 due to decreased distribution activity.
Incentive fees increased $17.9 million to $29.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to increases in incentive fees from our specialized funds and customized separate accounts.

Specialized funds revenue increased $36.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to a $15.2 million increase in revenue from our evergreen funds, a $9.1 million increase in revenue from our latest secondary fund, and an $8.6 million increase in revenue from our latest direct equity fund, which added $1.1 billion, $1.6 billion, and $0.9 billion, respectively, in fee-earning AUM between periods. Revenue from our latest direct equity fund included $2.4 million in retroactive fees for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. Customized separate accounts revenue increased $11.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021 due to the addition of several new accounts and additional allocations from existing accounts. Distribution management revenue decreased $7.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021 due to decreased distribution activity. Fund reimbursement revenue increased $3.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to the recognition of fund reimbursements from our latest secondary fund in the current year period. Incentive fees increased $102.4 million to $139.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to increases in incentive fees from our specialized funds.

Compensation and benefits expenses increased $11.7 million, or 34%, to $45.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to increases in base compensation and benefits and incentive fee compensation. Base compensation and benefits increased $6.1 million, or 21%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to an increase in our bonus plan accrual related to the increase in incentive fee revenue and an increase in salary expense from additional headcount in the current year period compared to the prior year period. Incentive fee compensation increased $4.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to the increase in incentive fee revenue.

Other Income (Expense) The following table shows the equity in income (loss) of investees of the Company and its consolidated VIEs included in other income (expense): Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, ($ in thousands) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Equity in income (loss) of investees Primary funds $ (537) $ 1,129  $ (210) $ 7,124  Direct investment funds (305) 867  (5,496) 15,375  Secondary funds 234  4,074  (546) 11,824  Customized separate accounts (1,350) 5,042  (3,502) 20,201  Other equity method investments 2,997  1,514  3,291  5,827  Total equity in income (loss) of investees $ 1,039  $ 12,626  $ (6,463) $ 60,351  Three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to three months ended December 31, 2021
Other income decreased $75.4 million to a $24.7 million loss for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to a decrease in other non-operating income and equity in income of investees. Non-operating income decreased $65.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to the recognition of a $43.3 million loss on an investment in the current year period and $31.7 million in gains on two investments in the prior year period.
Equity in income of investees decreased $11.6 million to a $1.0 million gain for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. This was due primarily to the gains of public market valuations during the quarter ended September 30, 2021. 33 Other income of consolidated VIEs increased $2.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to interest income of investments held in trust of our sponsored SPAC. Nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to nine months ended December 31, 2021 Other income decreased $140.1 million to a $16.2 million loss for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to a decrease in other non-operating income and equity in income of investees. Non-operating income decreased $74.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, due to the recognition of $15.0 million in losses on investments in the current year period compared to $59.7 million in gains on investments in the prior year period.
Equity in income of investees decreased $66.8 million to a $6.5 million loss for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021. This was due primarily to the prior year gains from increases in public market valuations during the period ended September 30, 2021 compared to losses for the period ended September 30, 2022. Other income of consolidated VIEs increased $7.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, due primarily to interest income of investments held in trust of our sponsored SPAC. Income Tax Expense
Our effective tax rate was 35.0% and 12.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 22.2% and 15.2% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
These rates were different from the statutory tax rates due to the portion of income allocated to non-controlling interests, valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and discrete tax adjustments recorded in the periods.
The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 were more than the three and nine
months ended December 31, 2021 due primarily to a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets not expected to be realized and discrete tax adjustments, which were higher in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 than the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021.

These are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are reconciled below. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Other companies may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.
Fee Related Earnings Fee Related Earnings (“FRE”) is used to highlight our earnings from recurring management fees. FRE represents net income excluding (a) incentive fees and related compensation, (b) interest income and expense, (c) income tax expense, (d) equity in income of investees, (e) other non-operating income and (f) certain other significant items that we believe are not indicative of our core performance. We believe FRE is useful to investors because it provides additional insight into the operating profitability of our business. FRE is presented before income taxes.
Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is an internal measure of profitability. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it enables them to better evaluate the performance of our core business across reporting periods. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income excluding (a) interest expense on our outstanding debt, (b) income tax expense, (c) depreciation and amortization expense, (d) equity-based compensation expense, (e) other non-operating income and (f) certain other significant items that we believe are not indicative of our core performance.

Incentive fee related compensation includes incentive fee compensation expense and bonus related to carried interest that is classified as base compensation.
37 Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share Non-GAAP earnings per share measures our per-share earnings excluding certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our core performance and assuming all Class B and Class C units in HLA were exchanged for Class A common stock in HLI. Non-GAAP earnings per share is calculated as adjusted net income divided by adjusted shares outstanding. Adjusted net income is income before taxes fully taxed at our estimated statutory tax rate and excludes any impact of changes in carrying amount of our redeemable non-controlling interest. Adjusted shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are equal to the weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding - diluted. We believe adjusted net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are useful to investors because they enable them to better evaluate total and per-share operating performance across reporting periods.
The following table shows a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income attributable to Hamilton Lane Incorporated for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, (in thousands, except share and per-share amounts) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net income attributable to Hamilton Lane Incorporated $ 9,669  $ 51,849  $ 78,034  $ 132,161  Income attributable to non-controlling interests in Hamilton Lane Advisors, L.L.C. 9,146  26,181  51,326  76,849  Income tax expense 11,788  11,519  38,766  37,515  Adjusted pre-tax net income 30,603  89,549  168,126  246,525  Adjusted income taxes

Represents corporate income taxes at our estimated statutory tax rate of 23.9% and 23.8% for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, applied to adjusted pre-tax net income. The 23.9% is based on a federal tax statutory rate of 21.0% and a combined state income tax rate net of federal benefits of 2.9%. The 23.8% is based on a federal tax statutory rate of 21.0% and a combined state income tax rate net of federal benefits of 2.8%.
38 Investment Performance The following tables present information relating to the historical performance of our specialized funds with fund families having at least two distinct vintages and most recent fund sizes of greater than $500 million per fund. The data are presented from the date indicated through September 30, 2022 and have not been adjusted to reflect acquisitions or disposals of investments subsequent to that date. When considering the data presented below, note that the historical results of our specialized funds are not indicative of the future results you should expect from such investments, from any future investment funds we may raise or from an investment in our Class A common stock, in part because: • market conditions and investment opportunities during previous periods may have been significantly more favorable for generating positive performance than those we may experience in the future; • the performance of our funds is generally calculated on the basis of the NAV of the funds’ investments, including unrealized gains, which may never be realized; • our historical returns derive largely from the performance of our earlier funds, whereas future fund returns will depend increasingly on the performance of our newer funds or funds not yet formed; • our newly established funds may generate lower returns during the period that they initially deploy their capital; • in recent years, there has been increased competition for investment opportunities resulting from the increased amount of capital invested in private markets alternatives and high liquidity in debt markets, and the increased competition for investments may reduce our returns in the future; and
• the performance of particular funds also will be affected by risks of the industries and businesses in which they invest. The historical and potential future returns of the investment funds we manage are not directly linked to returns on our Class A common stock. Therefore, you should not conclude that continued positive performance of the investment funds we manage will necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in our Class A common stock. As used in this discussion, internal rate of return (“IRR”) is calculated on a pooled basis using daily cash flows. See “Performance Methodology” below for more information on how our returns are calculated. Specialized Fund Performance We organize, invest and manage specialized primary, secondary and direct investment funds. Our specialized funds invest across a variety of private markets and include equity, equity-linked and credit funds offered on standard terms, as well as shorter duration, opportunistically oriented funds. Below is performance information across our various specialized funds. Substantially all of these funds are globally focused, and they are grouped by the investment strategy utilized. 39 Fund Vintage year Fund size ($M) Capital invested ($M) Gross multiple Net Multiple Gross IRR (%) Net IRR (%) Gross Spread vs. S&P 500 PME Net Spread vs. S&P 500 PME Gross Spread vs. MSCI World PME Net Spread vs. MSCI World PME Primaries

We believe these indices are commonly used by private markets and credit investors to evaluate performance. The PME calculation methodology allows private markets investment performance to be evaluated against a public index and assumes that capital is being invested in, or withdrawn from, the index on the days the capital was called and distributed from the underlying fund managers. The S&P 500 Index is a total return capitalization-weighted index that measures the performance of 500 U.S. large cap stocks. The MSCI World Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index of over 1,600 world stocks that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets. The CS HY II Index, formerly known as the DLJ High Yield Index, is designed to mirror the investable universe of the U.S. dollar denominated high yield debt market. Prices for the CS HY II Index are
40 available on a weekly basis. The CS LL Index is an index designed to mirror the investable universe of the U.S. dollar denominated leveraged loan market. Loans must be rated 5B or lower and the index frequency is monthly.
Our IRR represents the pooled IRR for all discretionary investments for the period from inception to September 30, 2022. Gross IRR is presented net of management fees, carried interest and expenses charged by the general partners of the underlying investments, but does not include our management fees, carried interest or expenses. Our gross IRR would decrease with the inclusion of our management fees, carried interest and expenses. Net IRR is net of all management fees, carried interest and expenses charged by the general partners of the underlying investments, as well as by us. Net IRR figures for our funds do not include cash flows attributable to the general partner. Note that secondary portfolio IRRs can be initially impacted by purchase discounts (or premiums) paid at the closing of a transaction, the impact of which will diminish over time. “Capital Invested” refers to the total amount of all investments made by a fund, including commitment-reducing and non-commitment-reducing capital calls. “Multiple” represents total distributions from underlying investments to the fund plus the fund’s market value divided by total contributed capital. “Gross Multiple” is presented net of management fees, carried interest and expenses charged by the fund managers of the underlying investments. Specialized fund and pre-fund performance does not include ten funds-of-funds that have investor-specific investment guidelines.
Many of our specialized funds utilize revolving credit facilities, which provide capital that is available to fund investments or pay partnership expenses and management fees. Borrowings may be paid down from time to time with investor capital contributions or distributions from investments. The use of a credit facility affects the fund’s return and magnifies the performance on the upside or on the downside.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Historical Liquidity and Capital Resources We have managed our historical liquidity and capital requirements primarily through the receipt of management and advisory fee revenues. Our primary cash flow activities involve: (1) generating cash flow from operations, which largely includes management and advisory fees; (2) realizations generated from our investment activities; (3) funding capital commitments that we have made to certain of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts; (4) making dividend payments to our stockholders and distributions to holders of HLA units; and (5) borrowings, interest payments and repayments under our outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents were $146.1 million and $72.1 million, respectively. Our
material
sources of cash from our operations include: (1) management and advisory fees, which are collected monthly or quarterly; (2) incentive fees, which are volatile and largely unpredictable as to amount and timing; and (3) fund distributions related to investments in
our specialized
funds and certain customized separate accounts that we manage. We use cash flow from operations primarily to pay compensation and related expenses, general, administrative and other expenses, debt service, capital expenditures and distributions to our owners and to fund commitments to certain of our
specialized
funds and customized separate accounts. If cash flow from operations were insufficient to fund distributions to our owners, we expect that we would suspend paying such distributions. 41 We have also accessed the capital markets and used proceeds from sales of our Class A common stock to settle in cash exchanges of HLA membership interests by direct and indirect owners of HLA pursuant to our exchange agreement.
Finally, we have used available cash and borrowings from our Loan Agreements (defined below) to make strategic investments in companies that seek to offer technology-driven private markets data and wealth management solutions. Loan Agreements On October 20, 2022, we entered into a new Multi-Draw Term Loan and Security Agreement (the “2022 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement”) and amended our existing Term Loan and Security Agreement (as amended, the “Term Loan Agreement”), Revolving Loan and Security Agreement (as amended, the “Revolving Loan Agreement”) and Multi-Draw Term Loan and Security Agreement (as amended, the “2020 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement” and, together with the 2022 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement, Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Loan Agreement, the “Loan Agreements”), with First Republic Bank (“First Republic”). The Loan Agreements are cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted and the aggregate principal amount of loans that may be outstanding under all of the Loan Agreements is subject to an aggregate cap of $325 million (the “Cap”). The 2022 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement has a maturity date of October 1, 2029 and the interest rate is a floating per annum rate equal to the prime rate minus 1.25% subject to a floor of 3.00%. As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding balance under the 2022 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement. We are entitled to request term loans not to exceed $75 million in the aggregate, subject to the Cap, through September 30, 2025. The Term Loan Agreement has a maturity date of January 1, 2030 and the interest rate is a floating per annum rate equal to the prime rate minus 1.25% subject to a floor of 3.00%. As of December 31, 2022, we had an outstanding balance of $100 million under the Term Loan Agreement. We are entitled to request additional uncommitted term advances not to exceed $25 million in the aggregate, subject to the Cap, through December 31, 2023. The Revolving Loan Agreement provides that the aggregate outstanding balance will not exceed $50 million, subject to the Cap, and has a maturity date of March 24, 2025. The interest rate is a floating per annum rate equal to the prime rate minus 1.50% subject to a floor of 2.25%. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have an outstanding balance under the Revolving Loan Agreement. The 2020 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement provides for a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $100 million with a maturity date of July 1, 2030. Advances could be drawn through March 31, 2022 and the interest rate is a fixed per annum rate of 3.50%. As of December 31, 2022, we had an outstanding balance of $100 million under the 2020 Multi-Draw Term Loan Agreement. 42 The Loan Agreements contain covenants that, among other things, limit HLA’s ability to incur indebtedness, transfer or dispose of assets, merge with other companies, create, incur or allow liens, make investments, pay dividends or make distributions, engage in transactions with affiliates and take certain actions with respect to management fees. The Loan Agreements also require HLA to maintain, among other requirements, (i) a specified amount of management fees, (ii) a specified amount of adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Loan Agreements, and (iii) a specified minimum tangible net worth, during the term of each of the Loan Agreements. The obligations under the Loan Agreements are secured by substantially all the assets of HLA. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the principal amount of debt outstanding equaled $200 million and $171.8 million, respectively.
Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity We generate significant cash flows from operating activities. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital requirements through our cash flows from operating activities, existing cash and cash equivalents and our ability to obtain future external financing.
We believe we will also continue to evaluate opportunities, based on market conditions, to access the capital markets and use proceeds from sales of our Class A common stock to settle in cash exchanges of HLA membership interests by direct and indirect owners of HLA pursuant to our exchange agreement. The timing or size of any potential transactions will depend on a number of factors, including market opportunities and our views regarding our capital and liquidity positions and potential future needs. There can be no assurance that any such transactions will be completed on favorable terms, or at all. We will also continue to evaluate opportunities to make strategic investments in companies that seek to offer technology-driven private markets data and wealth management solutions. In November 2018, we authorized a program to repurchase up to 6% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock, not to exceed $50 million (the “Stock Repurchase Program”). The Stock Repurchase Program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended or terminated by us at any time. We intend to finance the purchases using available working capital and/or external financing. The Stock Repurchase Program expires 12 months after the date of the first acquisition under the authorization. We have not repurchased any of our Class A common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program, and therefore the full purchase authority remains available. Our board of directors periodically reviews the Stock Repurchase Program and most recently re-approved it in December 2022. We expect that our primary short-term and long-term liquidity needs will comprise cash to: (1) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our business; (2) fund commitments to our investments; (3) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees; (4) make payments and/or exercise early termination buyout rights under the tax receivable agreement; (5) fund capital expenditures and make strategic investments; (6) pay interest and principal due on our outstanding debt; (7) pay income taxes; (8) make dividend payments to our stockholders and distributions to holders of HLA units in accordance with our distribution policy; (9) settle exchanges of HLA membership interests by direct and indirect owners of HLA pursuant to our exchange agreement from time to time; and (10) fund purchases of our Class A common stock pursuant to the Stock Repurchase Program.
We are required to maintain minimum net capital balances for regulatory purposes for certain of our foreign subsidiaries and our broker-dealer subsidiary. These net capital requirements are met by retaining cash. As a result, we may be restricted in our ability to transfer cash between different operating entities and jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, we were required to maintain approximately $3.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in liquid net assets within these subsidiaries to
43 meet regulatory net capital and capital adequacy requirements. We are in compliance with these regulatory requirements.
Dividend Policy The declaration and payment by us of any future dividends to holders of our Class A common stock is at the sole discretion of our board of directors. We intend to continue to pay a cash dividend on a quarterly basis. Subject to funds being legally available, we will cause HLA to make pro rata distributions to its members, including us, in an amount at least sufficient to allow us to pay all applicable taxes, to make payments under the tax receivable agreement, and to pay our corporate and other overhead expenses. Tax Receivable Agreement We expect that periodic exchanges of membership units of HLA by members of HLA will result in increases in the tax basis in our share of the assets of HLA that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis are expected to increase our depreciation and amortization deductions and create other tax benefits and therefore may reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. The tax receivable agreement will require us to pay 85% of the amount of these and certain other tax benefits, if any, that we realize (or are deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment, a change in control or a material breach by us of our obligations under the tax receivable agreement) to the pre-IPO members of HLA. Cash Flows Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
Nine Months Ended December 31, ($ in thousands) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 213,371  $ 152,512  Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 201,565  $ (55,664) Net cash used in financing activities $ (338,038) $ (104,885) Operating Activities Our operating activities generally reflect our earnings in the respective periods after adjusting for significant non-cash activity, including equity in income (loss) of investees, equity-based compensation, lease expense and depreciation and amortization, all of which are included in earnings. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our net cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by receipts of management fees and incentive fees offset by payment of operating expenses, which includes compensation and benefits and general, administrative and other expenses.
Investing Activities Our investing activities generally reflect cash used for acquisitions, fixed asset purchases and contributions to and distributions from our investments. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by purchases of furniture, fixtures
44 and equipment and net contributions to our funds. Additionally, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we received sale proceeds from and made purchases of non-fund investments. Financing Activities Our financing activities generally reflect cash received from debt and equity financings, payments to owners in the form of dividends, distributions and repurchases of shares and scheduled repayments of our outstanding debt. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by dividends paid to shareholders and distributions to HLA members. Additionally, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we borrowed additional amounts under our existing term loan and borrowed and fully repaid amounts under our revolving credit facility in order to fund contributions to our funds and other non-fund investments.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements There have been no material changes in our off-balance sheet arrangements discussed in our 2022 Form 10-K. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies  There have been no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies from those specified in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2022 Form 10-K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding recent accounting developments and their impact on our results can be found in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to a broad range of risks inherent in the financial markets in which we participate, including price risk, interest-rate risk, access to and cost of financing risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and foreign exchange-rate risk. Potentially negative effects of these risks may be mitigated to a certain extent by those aspects of our investment approach, investment strategies, fundraising practices or other business activities that are designed to benefit, either in relative or absolute terms, from periods of economic weakness, tighter credit or financial market dislocations.
45 Our predominant exposure to market risk is related to our role as general partner or investment manager for our specialized funds and customized separate accounts and the sensitivities to movements in the fair value of their investments, which may adversely affect our equity in income of investees. Since our management fees are generally based on commitments or net invested capital, our management fee and advisory fee revenue is not significantly impacted by changes in investment values.
Fair value of the financial assets and liabilities of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts may fluctuate in response to changes in the value of securities, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. The impact of investment risk is as follows: • Equity in income of investees changes along with the realized and unrealized gains of the underlying investments in our specialized funds and certain customized separate accounts in which we have a general partner commitment. Our general partner investments include thousands of unique underlying portfolio investments with no significant concentration in any industry or country outside of the United States. • Management fees from our specialized funds and customized separate accounts are not significantly affected by changes in fair value as the management fees are not generally based on the value of the specialized funds or customized separate accounts, but rather on the amount of capital committed or invested in the specialized funds or customized separate accounts, as applicable.
• Incentive fees from our specialized funds and customized separate accounts are not materially affected by changes in the fair value of unrealized investments because they are based on realized gains and subject to achievement of performance criteria rather than on the fair value of the specialized fund’s or customized separate account’s assets prior to realization. Minor decreases in underlying fair value would not affect the amount of deferred incentive fee revenue subject to clawback.
Exchange Rate Risk Several of our specialized funds and customized separate accounts hold investments denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies that may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and foreign currency, which could impact investment performance. The currency exposure related to investments in foreign currency assets is limited to our general partner interest, which is typically one percent of total capital commitments. We do not possess significant assets in foreign countries in which we operate or engage in material transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Therefore, changes in exchange rates are not expected to materially impact our financial statements.
Interest Rate Risk  As of December 31, 2022, we had $200.0 million in borrowings outstanding under our Loan Agreements. The annual interest rate on the Term Loan Agreement, which is at the prime rate minus 1.25%, subject to a floor of 3.00%, was 6.25% as of December 31, 2022. The annual interest rate on the Revolving Loan Agreement, which is at the prime rate minus 1.50%, subject to a floor of 2.25%, was 6.00% as of December 31, 2022. Based on the floating rate component of our Loan Agreements payable as of December 31, 2022, we estimate that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in increased interest expense of $1.0 million over the next 12 months.
46 Credit Risk We are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In such agreements, we depend on the respective counterparty to make payment or otherwise perform. We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions to reputable financial institutions. In other circumstances, availability of financing from financial institutions may be uncertain due to market events, and we may not be able to access these financing markets.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Our disclosure controls and procedures are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on management’s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at December 31, 2022. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 47 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to various legal, regulatory and/or administrative proceedings from time to time. Although there can be no assurance of the outcome of such proceedings, in the opinion of management, we do not believe it is probable that any pending or, to our knowledge, threatened legal proceeding or claim would individually or in the aggregate materially affect our condensed consolidated financial statements. Item 1A. Risk Factors There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2022 Form 10-K. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The following table provides information about our repurchase activity with respect to shares of our Class A common stock for the quarter ended December 31, 2022: Period Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Maximum Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (2) October 1-31, 2022 —  $ —  —  $ 50,000,000  November 1-30, 2022 —  $ —  —  $ 50,000,000  December 1-31, 2022 991  $ 72.27  —  $ 50,000,000  Total 991   $ 72.27   —  $ 50,000,000  (1) Represents shares of Class A common stock tendered by employees as payment of taxes withheld on the vesting of restricted stock granted under HLI’s 2017 Equity Incentive Plan. (2) On November 6, 2018, we announced that our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to 6% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the date of the authorization, not to exceed $50 million (the “Stock Repurchase Program”). The authorization provides us the flexibility to repurchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, based on market conditions and other factors. We have not repurchased any of our Class A common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program, so the full purchase authority remains available under this program, which expires 12 months after the date of the first acquisition under the authorization. Our board of directors most recently re-approved the Stock Repurchase Program in December 2022. 48 Item 6.
