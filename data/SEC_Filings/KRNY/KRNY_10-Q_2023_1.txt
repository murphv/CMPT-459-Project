NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)
1.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kearny Financial Corp. (the “Company”), its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kearny Bank (the “Bank”) and the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company conducts its business principally through the Bank. Management prepared the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), including the elimination of all significant inter-company accounts and transactions during consolidation. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X and do not include the information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial condition, income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements have been included. The results of operations for the three months and six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other period. The data in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at June 30, 2022 was derived from the Company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. That data, along with the interim unaudited financial information presented in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, Income, Comprehensive Income, Changes in Stockholders’ Equity and Cash Flows should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, included in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to U.S. GAAP and to general practice within the financial services industry. A discussion of these policies can be found in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies since June 30, 2022. 2.     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company has evaluated events and transactions occurring subsequent to the statement of financial condition date of December 31, 2022, for items that should potentially be recognized or disclosed in these consolidated financial statements. The evaluation was conducted through the date this document was filed. On January 26, 2023, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.11
per share, payable on February 22, 2023 to stockholders of record as of February 8, 2023. 3.     RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued
ASU 2022-02, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures”
to improve the usefulness of information provided to investors about certain loan refinancings, restructurings and writeoffs. ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors and enhances disclosure requirements for certain modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, ASU 2022-02 requires public business entities to disclose current-period gross writeoffs for financing receivables and net investments in leases by year of origination in the vintage disclosures. For entities that have adopted ASU 2016-13, the amendments in ASU 2022-02 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted if an entity has adopted ASU 2016-13, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity elects to early adopt the amendments in ASU 2022-02, the guidance should be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. An entity may elect to early adopt the amendments about TDRs and related disclosure enhancements separately from the amendments related to vintage disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2022-02 should be applied prospectively, but for the amendments related to the recognition and measurement of TDRs, an entity has the option to apply a modified retrospective transition method that would result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.
- 8 - Index Adoption of New Accounting Standards In December 2022, the FASB issued
ASU 2022-06, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848”
that extends the period of time preparers can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance. In 2020, the FASB issued
ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting”
which provides optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The objective of the guidance in Topic 848 is to provide relief during the temporary transition period, so the FASB included a sunset provision within Topic 848 based on expectations of when LIBOR would cease being published. In 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority delayed the intended cessation date of certain tenors of USD LIBOR to June 30, 2023. To ensure the relief in Topic 848 covers the period of time during which a significant number of modifications may take place, ASU 2022-06 defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. For all entities, the amendments in ASU 2022-06 are effective upon issuance. The Company adopted this ASU on December 21, 2022 on a prospective basis; therefore, there was no impact to its consolidated financial statements upon adoption. In March 2022, the FASB issued
ASU 2022-01, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method”
which clarifies the guidance in ASC 815 on fair value hedge accounting of interest rate risk for portfolios of financial assets. This ASU amends the guidance in ASU 2017-12 (released in August 2017) that, among other things, established the last-of-layer method to enable fair value hedge accounting for these portfolios to be more accessible. ASU 2022-01 expands the current last-of-layer method to allow multiple hedged layers of a single closed portfolio under this method. To reflect that expansion, the last-of-layer method is renamed the portfolio layer method. The scope of last-of-layer hedging will be expanded so that the portfolio layer method can be utilized for nonprepayable financial assets. In addition, ASU 2022-01 specifies eligible hedging instruments in a single-layer hedge, provides additional guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of hedge basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method, and specifies how hedge basis adjustments should be considered when determining credit losses for the assets included in the closed portfolio. For public business entities, the amendments in ASU 2022-01 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted on any date on or after the issuance of ASU 2022-01 for any entity that has adopted the amendments in ASU 2017-12 for the corresponding period. The Company adopted this ASU on July 1, 2022 on a prospective basis; therefore, there was no impact to its consolidated financial statements upon adoption . 4.     SECURITIES The following tables present the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and estimated fair values for available for sale securities and the amortized cost, gross unrecognized gains and losses and estimated fair values for held to maturity securities as of the dates indicated: December 31, 2022 Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Allowance for Credit Losses Fair Value (In Thousands) Available for sale:         Debt securities:         Asset-backed securities $ 161,509   $ —   $ 2,886   $ —   $ 158,623   Collateralized loan obligations 393,027   31   8,999   —   384,059   Corporate bonds 159,769   3   14,817   —   144,955   Total debt securities 714,305   34   26,702   —   687,637           Mortgage-backed securities:         Residential pass-through securities

An impairment related to credit factors would be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is limited to the amount by which the security’s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value. An impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses shall be recorded through other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Investment securities will be written down to fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Income if management intends to sell, or may be required to sell, the securities before they recover in value. The issuers of these securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments and none of these securities were past due or were placed in nonaccrual status at December 31, 2022. Management believes that the unrealized losses on these securities are a function of changes in market interest rates and credit spreads, not changes in credit quality.
No
allowance for credit losses was recorded at December 31, 2022 on available for sale securities.
- 13 - Index The sale of available for sale securities during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was part of a wholesale restructuring and the proceeds were reinvested in higher yielding securities. The Company was not required to sell these securities. At December 31, 2022, the held to maturity securities portfolio consists of agency mortgage-backed securities and obligations of state and political subdivisions. The mortgage-backed securities are issued by U.S. government agencies and are implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. The obligations of state and political subdivisions in the portfolio are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. The Company regularly monitors the obligations of state and political subdivisions sector of the market and reviews collectability including such factors as the financial condition of the issuers as well as credit ratings in effect as of the reporting period.
No
allowance for credit losses was recorded at December 31, 2022 on held to maturity securities.

Loans that become 90 days past due, but are well secured and in the process of collection, may remain on accrual status. Nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when all payments due are brought current and the Company expects to receive all remaining principal and interest payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Payments received in cash on nonaccrual loans, including both the principal and interest portions of those payments, are generally applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan. The Company did not recognize interest income on non-accrual loans during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Subsequent to their modification, TDRs are placed on non-accrual until such time as satisfactory payment performance has been demonstrated, at which time the loan may be returned to accrual status. On a case-by-case basis, the Company may agree to modify the contractual terms of a loan to assist a borrower who may be experiencing financial difficulty, as well as to preserve the Company’s position in the loan. If the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a concession has been made at the time of such modification, the loan is classified as a TDR. The Company had TDRs totaling $ 18.4
million and $ 22.2
million as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The allowance for credit losses associated with the TDRs presented in the tables below totaled $ 331,000

charge-offs related to TDRs. During the three months and six months ended December 31, 2022, there were
two
TDR defaults totaling $ 170,000 . During the three months and six months ended December 31, 2021, there were
no
defaults of TDRs. Loan modifications generally involve a reduction in interest rates and/or extension of maturity dates and also may include step up interest rates in their modified terms which will impact their weighted average yield in the future. The loans which qualified as TDRs during the three months and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, capitalized prior past due amounts and modified the repayment terms. - 17 - Index Individually Analyzed Loans Individually analyzed loans include loans which do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans. TDRs will generally be evaluated for individual impairment, however, after a period of sustained repayment performance which permits the credit to be returned to accrual status, a TDR would generally be removed from individual impairment analysis and returned to its corresponding pool. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of individually analyzed loans, including loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality that were individually analyzed, totaled $ 40.5
million, of which $ 36.9
million were considered collateral dependent. For collateral dependent loans where management has determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment of the loan is to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. See Note 12 for additional disclosure regarding fair value of individually analyzed collateral dependent loans. The following table presents the carrying value and related allowance of collateral dependent individually analyzed loans at the dates indicated: December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Carrying Value Related Allowance Carrying Value Related Allowance (In Thousands) Commercial loans: Multi-family mortgage $ 16,271   $ 352   $ 26,653   $ 849   Nonresidential mortgage

Credit Quality Indicators The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually to classify the loans as to credit risk. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Pass –
Loans that are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor (or guarantors, if any) or by the fair value, less cost to acquire and sell, of any underlying collateral in a timely manner. Special Mention
– Loans which do not currently expose the Company to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification but have some credit deficiencies or other potential weaknesses. Substandard –
Loans which are inadequately protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful –
Loans which have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. Loss –
Loans which are considered uncollectible or of so little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. - 18 - Index The following table presents the risk category of loans as of December 31, 2022 by loan segment and vintage year:

The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to specific wholesale funding positions and assets. Fair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Statement of Financial Condition
The tables below present the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the Statements of Financial Condition as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022: December 31, 2022 Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives Location Fair Value Location Fair Value (In Thousands) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Interest rate contracts Other assets $ 63,617   Other liabilities $ 2,500   Total $ 63,617   $ 2,500   June 30, 2022 Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives Location Fair Value Location Fair Value (In Thousands) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Interest rate contracts Other assets $ 41,223   Other liabilities $ —   Total $ 41,223   $ —   Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company’s uses derivatives to add stability to interest expense and interest income and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and an interest rate floor as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. These interest rate products are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a total of
12
interest rate swaps and caps with a total notional amount of $ 1.33
billion hedging specific wholesale funding and
one
interest rate floor with a notional amount of $ 100.0
million hedging floating-rate available for sale securities.
For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
For cash flow hedges on the Company’s wholesale funding positions, amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s hedged variable rate wholesale funding positions. During the three months and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company reclassified $ 4.1
million and $ 5.7
million, respectively, as a reduction in interest expense. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that $ 28.2
million will be reclassified as a reduction in interest expense. For cash flow hedges on the Company’s assets, amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest income as interest payments are received on the Company’s hedged variable rate assets. During the three months and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not reclassify any amount to interest income. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that $ 81,000
will be reclassified as additional interest income. - 25 - Index The table below presents the pre-tax effects of the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (In Thousands)

The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Such derivatives are used to hedge the changes in fair value of certain of its pools of fixed rate assets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had
three
interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $ 500.0
million hedging fixed-rate residential mortgage loans. For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income. The table below presents the effects of the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months and six months ended December 31, 2022. There were no fair value hedges for the three months and six months ended December 31, 2021: Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2022 (In Thousands)

Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, market data by correlation or other means.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. Assets Measured on a Recurring Basis: The following methods and significant assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022: Investment Securities Available for Sale
The Company’s available for sale investment securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the securities’ terms and conditions, among other things. From time to time, the Company validates prices supplied by the independent pricing service by comparison to prices obtained from third-party sources or derived using internal models. Derivatives The Company has contracted with a third party vendor to provide periodic valuations for its interest rate derivatives to determine the fair value of its interest rate contracts. The vendor utilizes standard valuation methodologies applicable to interest rate derivatives such as discounted cash flow analysis and extensions of the Black-Scholes model. Such valuations are based upon readily observable market data and are therefore considered Level 2 valuations by the Company. - 29 - Index Those assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below: December 31, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total (In Thousands) Assets: Debt securities available for sale: Asset-backed securities $ —   $ 158,623   $ —   $ 158,623   Collateralized loan obligations —   384,059   —   384,059   Corporate bonds —   144,955   —   144,955   Total debt securities —   687,637   —   687,637   Mortgage-backed securities available for sale: Residential pass-through securities —   450,156   —   450,156   Commercial pass-through securities —   148,561   —   148,561   Total mortgage-backed securities —   598,717   —   598,717   Total securities available for sale $ —   $ 1,286,354   $ —   $ 1,286,354   Interest rate contracts $ —   $ 63,617   $ —   $ 63,617   Total assets $ —   $ 1,349,971   $ —   $ 1,349,971   Liabilities: Interest rate contracts $ —   $ 2,500   $ —   $ 2,500   Total liabilities $ —   $ 2,500   $ —   $ 2,500   - 30 - Index June 30, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total (In Thousands) Assets: Debt securities available for sale: Obligations of state and political subdivisions $ —   $ 28,435   $ —   $ 28,435   Asset-backed securities —   166,557   —   166,557   Collateralized loan obligations —   307,813   —   307,813   Corporate bonds —   153,397   —   153,397   Total debt securities —   656,202   —   656,202   Mortgage-backed securities available for sale: Collateralized mortgage obligations —   7,122   —   7,122   Residential pass-through securities —   514,758   —   514,758   Commercial pass-through securities —   166,011   —   166,011   Total mortgage-backed securities —   687,891   —   687,891   Total securities available for sale $ —   $ 1,344,093   $ —   $ 1,344,093   Interest rate contracts $ —   $ 41,223   $ —   $ 41,223   Total assets $ —   $ 1,385,316   $ —   $ 1,385,316   Assets Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis: The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022: Individually Analyzed Collateral Dependent Loans The fair value of collateral dependent loans that are individually analyzed is determined based upon the appraised fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell. Such collateral primarily consists of real estate and, to a lesser extent, other business assets. Management may also adjust appraised values to reflect estimated changes in market values or apply other adjustments to appraised values resulting from its knowledge of the collateral. Internal valuations may be utilized to determine the fair value of other business assets. For non-collateral-dependent loans, management estimates fair value using discounted cash flows based on inputs that are largely unobservable and instead reflect management’s own estimates of the assumptions as a market participant would in pricing such loans. Individually analyzed collateral dependent loans are considered a Level 3 valuation by the Company. Other Real Estate Owned Other real estate owned is recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs when acquired, thus establishing a new cost basis. Fair value is generally based on independent appraisals. These appraisals include adjustments to comparable assets based on the appraisers’ market knowledge and experience. When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated selling costs, is charged to the allowance for credit losses. If further declines in the estimated fair value of the asset occur, a write-down is recorded through expense. The valuation of foreclosed assets is subjective in nature and may be adjusted in the future because of changes in economic conditions. Other real estate owned is considered a Level 3 valuation by the Company. - 31 - Index Those assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are summarized below:

___________________________________ (1) The fair value of collateral dependent loans is generally determined based on an independent appraisal of the fair value of a loan’s underlying collateral. (2) The fair value basis of collateral dependent loans and other real estate owned is adjusted to reflect management’s estimates of selling costs including, but not limited to, real estate brokerage commissions and title transfer fees. (3) The fair value of other real estate owned is generally determined based upon the lower of an independent appraisal of the property’s fair value or the applicable listing price or contracted sales price. At December 31, 2022, collateral dependent loans valued using Level 3 inputs comprised loans with principal balance totaling $ 23.3
million and valuation allowance of $ 2.8

Once a loan is foreclosed, the fair value of the other real estate owned continues to be evaluated based upon the fair value of the repossessed real estate originally securing the loan. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company held other real estate owned totaling $ 13.4

The fair value of commitments to fund credit lines and originate or participate in loans held in portfolio or loans held for sale is estimated using fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed rate loan commitments, including those relating to loans held for sale that are considered derivative instruments for financial statement reporting purposes, the fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest and the committed rates. The carrying value, represented by the net deferred fee arising from the unrecognized commitment, and the fair value, determined by discounting the remaining contractual fee over the term of the commitment using fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements with similar credit risk, is not considered material for disclosure.
Limitations.
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no fair value exists for a significant portion of the financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
The fair value estimates are based on existing on-and-off balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to value anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Other significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets and liabilities include premises and equipment, and advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance. In addition, the ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.
Finally, reasonable comparability between financial institutions may not be likely due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates which must be made given the absence of active secondary markets for many of the financial instruments. This lack of uniform valuation methodologies introduces a greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair values. - 35 - Index 13.     COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss included in stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 are as follows: December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 (In Thousands)

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include certain forward-looking statements based on current management expectations. Such forward-looking statements may be identified by reference to a future period or periods or by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as “may”, “will”, “believe”, “expect”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “continue”, or similar terms or variations on those terms, or the negative of those terms. The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those management expectations. This includes statements regarding general economic conditions, public health crisis such as the governmental, social and economic effects of the novel coronavirus, legislative and regulatory changes, monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, changes in tax policies, rates and regulations of federal, state and local tax authorities and failure to integrate or profitably operate acquired businesses. Additional potential factors include changes in interest rates, the rate of inflation, deposit flows, cost of funds, demand for loan products and financial services, competition and changes in the quality or composition of loan and investment portfolios of the Company. Other factors that could cause future results to vary from current management expectations include changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines, and other economic, competitive, governmental and technological factors affecting the Company’s operations, markets, products, services and prices. Further description of the risks and uncertainties to the business are included in the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on the Company, its clients and the communities it serves. Given its dynamic nature, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Reference is made to Item 1A “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, the Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to release publicly the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of the statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. Critical Accounting Policies
Our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. We consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or to make significant assumptions that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies. At December 31, 2022, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as compared to the critical accounting policies disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Reference is made to Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 Executive Summary.
Total assets increased $569.4 million to $8.29 billion at December 31, 2022 from $7.72 billion at June 30, 2022. The increase primarily reflected an increase in net loans receivable. Investment Securities.
Investment securities available for sale decreased $57.7 million to $1.29 billion at December 31, 2022, from $1.34 billion at June 30, 2022. This decrease was largely the result of sales of $120.4 million, principal repayments of $70.8 million and a fair value decrease of $32.8 million, partially offset by purchases of $166.5 million.
Investment securities held to maturity increased $35.5 million to $153.8 million at December 31, 2022 from $118.3 million at June 30, 2022. This increase was the result of purchases of $40.4 million, partially offset by principal repayments of $4.9 million. Additional information regarding our investment securities at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 is presented in Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. Loans Held-for-Sale.
Loans held-for-sale totaled $12.9 million at December 31, 2022 as compared to $28.9 million at June 30, 2022 and are reported separately from the balance of net loans receivable. Loans held-for-sale consisted of residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans of $4.3 million and $8.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022 as compared to $7.1 million and $21.7 million, respectively, at June 30, 2022. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we sold $59.3 million of residential mortgage loans, resulting in a gain on sale of $446,000, and $15.7 million of commercial mortgage loans, resulting in a net gain on sale of $28,000. - 38 - Index Net Loans Receivable.
Net loans receivable increased $564.5 million, or 10.5%, to $5.94 billion at December 31, 2022 from $5.37 billion at June 30, 2022. Details regarding the change in the loan portfolio, by loan segment, is presented below: December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Increase/

One- to four-family residential mortgage loan origination volume, excluding loans held-for-sale, totaled $150.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and was supplemented with the purchase of loans totaling $656,000. Home equity loan and line of credit origination volume for the same period totaled $18.1 million.
Loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios are based on current period loan balances and original appraised values at the time of origination unless a current appraisal has been obtained as a result of the loan being deemed collateral dependent and individually analyzed. The following table sets forth the composition of our real estate secured loans indicating the LTV, by loan category, at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022: December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Balance LTV Balance LTV (Dollars in Thousands) Commercial mortgage loans: Multi-family mortgage $ 2,851,721  64  % $ 2,409,090  64  % Nonresidential mortgage 1,017,341  54  1,019,838  54  Construction 186,663  60  140,131  61  Total commercial mortgage loans 4,055,725  61  3,569,059  61  One- to four-family residential mortgage 1,719,514  63  1,645,816  62  Consumer loans: Home equity loans 45,690  48  42,028  46  Total mortgage loans $ 5,820,929  62  % $ 5,256,903  61  % Additional information about our loans at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 is presented in Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. - 39 - Index Nonperforming Assets and TDRs.
Nonperforming assets decreased by $29.6 million to $62.6 million, or 0.76% of total assets, at December 31, 2022, from $92.2 million, or 1.19% of total assets, at June 30, 2022. At December 31, 2022, we had accruing TDRs totaling $10.5 million, an increase of $1.8 million from $8.7 million at June 30, 2022. At December 31, 2022, we had non-accrual TDRs totaling $7.9 million, a decrease of $5.6 million from $13.5 million at June 30, 2022. At December 31, 2022, nonperforming assets consisted of $40.5 million of nonperforming loans, $8.7 million of non-accrual commercial loans held for sale and $13.4 million of other real estate owned (“OREO”). At June 30, 2022, nonperforming assets consisted of $70.3 million of nonperforming loans, $21.7 million of non-accrual commercial loans held for sale and $178,000 of OREO. Additional information about our nonperforming loans and TDRs at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 is presented in Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”).
At December 31, 2022, the ACL totaled $48.9 million, or 0.81% of total loans, reflecting an increase of $1.8 million from $47.1 million, or 0.87% of total loans, at June 30, 2022. The increase during the six months ended December 31, 2022 was largely attributable to a provision for credit losses of $2.3 million, primarily driven by loan growth, partially offset by a reduction in the expected life of the loan portfolio and a reduction in the qualitative component of our ACL.
Additional information about our ACL at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 is presented in Note 6 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. Other Assets.
The aggregate balance of other assets, including premises and equipment, FHLB stock, interest receivable, goodwill, core deposit intangibles, bank owned life insurance, deferred income taxes, OREO and other assets, increased $69.1 million to $825.3 million at December 31, 2022 from $756.2 million at June 30, 2022. The increase in the balance of these other assets during the six months ended December 31, 2022 largely reflected a $22.4 million increase in the fair value of our derivative assets, a $21.9 million increase in FHLB stock and a $13.2 million increase in OREO. The increase in OREO was a result of our acquisition of a $13.0 million nonresidential real estate property through foreclosure during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The remaining change generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within these line items.
Deposits.
Total deposits increased $109.1 million, or 1.9%, to $5.97 billion at December 31, 2022 from $5.86 billion at June 30, 2022. Included in total deposits are brokered and listing service time deposits of $747.5 million at December 31, 2022 and $773.5 million at June 30, 2022. The following table sets forth the distribution of, and changes in, deposits, by type, for the periods indicated: December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Increase/ (Decrease) (In Thousands) Non-interest-bearing deposits $ 650,950  $ 653,899  $ (2,949) Interest-bearing deposits: Interest-bearing demand 2,316,485  2,265,597  50,888  Savings 901,514  1,053,198  (151,684) Certificates of deposit 2,102,422  1,889,562  212,860  Interest-bearing deposits 5,320,421  5,208,357  112,064  Total deposits $ 5,971,371  $ 5,862,256  $ 109,115  Additional information about our deposits at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 is presented in Note 7 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Borrowings.
The balance of borrowings increased by $482.2 million to $1.38 billion at December 31, 2022 from $901.3 million at June 30, 2022. The growth in borrowings complemented the growth in deposits and collectively were used to fund our balance sheet growth. Additional information about our borrowings at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 is presented in Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Other Liabilities.
The balance of other liabilities, including advance payments by borrowers for taxes and other miscellaneous liabilities, decreased $556,000 to $61.7 million at December 31, 2022 from $62.3 million at June 30, 2022. The change in the balance of these other liabilities generally reflected normal operating fluctuations during the period. - 40 - Index Stockholders’ Equity.
Stockholders’ equity decreased $21.4 million to $872.6 million at December 31, 2022 from $894.0 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease in stockholders’ equity during the six months ended December 31, 2022 largely reflected share repurchases of $14.4 million and cash dividends of $14.4 million. In addition, other comprehensive loss, net of income tax, was $13.3 million, which was driven by a decline in the fair value of our available for sale securities, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our derivatives portfolio. These items were partially offset by net income of $18.5 million. Book value per share decreased by $0.07 to $12.95 at December 31, 2022 while tangible book value per share decreased by $0.12 to $9.78 at December 31, 2022. On August 1, 2022, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized a new stock repurchase plan to repurchase up to 4,000,000 shares, and the completion of our previous stock repurchase plan, which authorized the repurchase of 7,602,021 shares. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 1,309,606 shares of common stock at a cost of $14.4 million, or $11.02 per share, including 984,461 shares, or 24.6% of the shares authorized for repurchase under the current repurchase program, at a total cost of $10.8 million or $10.98 per share. Comparison of Operating Results for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 Net Income . Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was $2.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to $18.8 million, or $0.26 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net income reflected a decrease in net interest income, an increase in the provision for credit losses, a decrease in non-interest income and an increase in non-interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense. The primary driver of the decrease in net income was the $15.2 million loss on the sale of securities that resulted from a previously announced wholesale restructuring. Net Interest Income . Net interest income decreased by $3.9 million to $44.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to $48.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The decrease between the comparative periods resulted from an increase of $20.4 million in interest expense, partially offset by an increase of $16.5 million in interest income. Included in net interest income for the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, was purchase accounting accretion of $1.9 million and $2.6 million, and loan prepayment penalty income of $166,000 and $1.5 million.
Net interest margin decreased 58 basis points to 2.38% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, from 2.96% for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 and reflected increases in the cost and average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by increases in the average balance and yield on interest-earning assets. The increased cost of interest-bearing liabilities and yield on interest-earning assets is the result of higher market interest rates that were caused by an increase in the federal funds target rate from 0% - 0.25% in March 2022 to 4.25% - 4.50% in December 2022. - 41 - Index Details surrounding the composition of, and changes to, net interest income are presented in the table below which reflects the components of the average balance sheet and of net interest income for the periods indicated. We derived the average yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented with daily balances used to derive average balances. No tax equivalent adjustments have been made to yield or costs. Non-accrual loans were included in the calculation of average balances, however interest receivable on these loans has been fully reserved for and therefore not included in interest income. The yields and costs set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense.

The provision for credit losses increased $4.1 million to a provision for credit losses of $1.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to a provision for credit losses reversal of $2.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The provision for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was largely attributable to loan growth, partially offset by a reduction in the qualitative component of our ACL. By comparison, the provision reversal for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 was largely attributable to a net reduction in reserves on individually evaluated loans and a reduction in the expected life of various segments of the loan portfolio. Additional information regarding the ACL and the associated provisions recognized during the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is presented in Note 6 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements as well as the Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.
Non-Interest Income . Total non-interest income decreased $12.6 million to a loss of $8.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Loss on sale and call of securities was $15.2 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to no gain or loss recorded during the prior period. The loss was the result of a previously announced wholesale restructuring that involved the sale of $120.4 million of available for sale securities during the quarter. The proceeds of the sale were reinvested in higher yielding securities. Gain on sale of loans decreased $836,000 to $134,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in loan sale gains largely reflected a decrease in the volume of loans sold between comparative periods.
Other non-interest income increased $3.2 million to $3.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The increase in other non-interest income was primarily attributable to a non-recurring gain of $2.9 million from the sale of a former branch location and a $660,000 increase in income from investment services. These increases were partially offset by $356,000 of non-recurring gains on asset disposals in the prior comparative period. The remaining changes in the other components of non-interest income between comparative periods generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those line items. Non-Interest Expense . Total non-interest expense increased $3.0 million to $32.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Salaries and employee benefits increased $1.8 million to $19.9 million for quarter ended December 31, 2022. This increase was largely due to higher salary expense, an increase in incentive payments tied to loan origination volume and non-recurring severance expense resulting from a workforce realignment. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in incentive compensation expense. FDIC insurance premiums increased $505,000 to $1.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The increase was largely driven by asset growth. Other non-interest expense increased $702,000 to $3.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to a $502,000 increase in the provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments.
The remaining changes in the other components of non-interest expense between comparative periods generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those line items. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes decreased $6.8 million to $33,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 from $6.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in income tax expense reflected a lower level of pre-tax income as compared to the prior period. Effective tax rates for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 1.7% and 26.6%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a year-to-date tax rate true-up which resulted from the loss on the sale of securities during the current quarter. The loss lowered our full year projected taxable income and income tax provision. - 43 - Index Comparison of Operating Results for the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 Net Income . Net income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $18.5 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $38.5 million, or $0.53 per diluted share for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net income reflected a decrease in net interest income, an increase in the provision for credit losses, a decrease in non-interest income and an increase in non-interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense.
Net Interest Income . Net interest income decreased by $5.0 million to $93.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $98.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease between the comparative periods resulted from an increase of $28.7 million in interest expense, partially offset by an increase of $23.7 million in interest income. Included in net interest income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, was purchase accounting accretion of $3.7 million and $5.5 million, and loan prepayment penalty income of $607,000 and $3.2 million. Net interest margin decreased 45 basis points to 2.53% for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from 2.98% for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and reflected increases in the cost and average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by increases in the average balance and yield on interest-earning assets. The increased cost of interest-bearing liabilities and yield on interest-earning assets is the result of higher market interest rates that were caused by an increase in the federal funds target rate from 0% - 0.25% in March 2022 to 4.25% - 4.50% in December 2022.
- 44 - Index Details surrounding the composition of, and changes to, net interest income are presented in the table below which reflects the components of the average balance sheet and of net interest income for the periods indicated. We derived the average yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented with daily balances used to derive average balances. No tax equivalent adjustments have been made to yield or costs. Non-accrual loans were included in the calculation of average balances, however interest receivable on these loans has been fully reserved for and therefore not included in interest income. The yields and costs set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense.

The provision for credit losses increased $10.2 million to a provision for credit losses of $2.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a provision for credit losses reversal of $7.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The provision for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was largely attributable to loan growth, partially offset by a reduction in the qualitative component of our ACL and a reduction in the expected life of the loan portfolio. By comparison, the provision reversal for the six months ended December 31, 2021 was largely attributable to a release of reserves, which reflected improvement in our credit risk outlook and a reduction in the expected life of various segments of the loan portfolio.
Additional information regarding the ACL and the associated provisions recognized during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is presented in Note 6 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements as well as the Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022.
Non-Interest Income . Total non-interest income decreased $10.5 million to a loss of $2.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Loss on sale and call of securities was $15.2 million during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to a gain of $1,000 recorded during the prior comparative period. The loss was the result of a previously announced wholesale restructuring that involved the sale of $120.4 million of available for sale securities during the six months ended December 31, 2022. The proceeds of the sale were reinvested in higher yielding securities. Gain on sale of loans decreased $1.4 million to $529,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in loan sale gains largely reflected a decrease in the volume of loans sold between comparative periods.
Income from bank owned life insurance increased $2.3 million to $5.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The increase is the result of payouts on life insurance policies.
Other non-interest income increased $3.6 million to $4.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in other non-interest income was primarily attributable to a non-recurring gain of $2.9 million from the sale of a former branch location and a $1.1 million increase in income from investment services. These increases were partially offset by $356,000 of non-recurring gains on asset disposals in the prior comparative period. The remaining changes in the other components of non-interest income between comparative periods generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those line items. Non-Interest Expense . Total non-interest expense increased $3.2 million to $64.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Salaries and employee benefits increased $3.6 million to $40.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. This increase was largely due to higher salary expense, an increase in incentive payments tied to loan origination volume and non-recurring severance expense resulting from a workforce realignment. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in incentive compensation expense. Net occupancy expense of premises decreased $1.6 million to $6.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to $1.5 million of non-recurring expenses related to the consolidation of three retail branch locations and a leased office facility recognized in the prior period. FDIC insurance premiums increased $919,000 to $2.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The increase was largely driven by asset growth. The remaining changes in the other components of non-interest expense between comparative periods generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those line items. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes decreased $8.8 million to $5.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $14.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in income tax expense reflected a lower level of pre-tax income as compared to the prior period. Effective tax rates for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 22.2% and 26.8%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to lower full year projected taxable income, noted above, as well as non-taxable payouts on life insurance policies, noted above, during the six months ended December 31, 2022. - 46 - Index Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity, represented by cash and cash equivalents, is a product of operating, investing and financing activities. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, cash flows from investment securities and loans receivable and funds provided from operations. While scheduled payments from the amortization and maturity of loans and investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds, general interest rates, economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and prepayments on loans and securities.
At December 31, 2022, liquidity included $75.7 million of short-term cash and equivalents and $1.29 billion of investment securities available for sale. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we had the capacity to borrow additional funds totaling $1.68 billion and $307.2 million from the FHLB of New York and FRB, respectively, without pledging additional collateral. As of that same date, we also had access to unsecured overnight borrowings with other financial institutions totaling $995.0 million of which none was outstanding. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding commitments to originate and purchase loans totaling $31.5 million while such commitments totaled $242.1 million at June 30, 2022. As of those same dates, our pipeline of loans held for sale included $10.2 million and $20.3 million, respectively, of loans in process whose terms included interest rate locks to borrowers that were paired with a best-efforts commitment to sell the loan to a buyer at a fixed price and within a predetermined timeframe after the sale commitment is established. Construction loans in process and unused lines of credit were $93.7 million and $162.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022 compared to $109.0 million and $159.3 million, respectively, at June 30, 2022. We are also subject to the contingent liabilities resulting from letters of credit whose outstanding balances totaled $115,000 and $130,000, at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the customer. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
Consistent with its goals to operate a sound and profitable financial organization, the Bank actively seeks to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution in accordance with regulatory standards. The following table sets forth the Bank’s capital position at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, as compared to the minimum regulatory capital requirements that were in effect as of those dates:

The interim final rule provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL’s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss method, followed by a three-year transition period established in the previous rule (five-year transition option). We have adopted the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period. The two-year delay ended for us as of June 30, 2022 and we then began the three-year transition period.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of our business of investing in loans and securities we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk. These financial instruments include significant purchase commitments, such as commitments related to capital expenditure plans and commitments to extend credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. We had no significant off-balance sheet commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2022. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For a discussion of the expected impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have yet to adopt, please refer to Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
The majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and as such, interest rate risk is a significant form of market risk that we must manage. Interest rate risk is generally defined in regulatory nomenclature as the risk to earnings or capital arising from the movement of interest rates and arises from several risk factors including re-pricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option risk. We maintain an Asset/Liability Management (“ALM”) program in order manage our interest rate risk. The program is overseen by the Board of Directors through its Interest Rate Risk Management Committee which has assigned the responsibility for the operational aspects of the ALM program to our Asset/Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”), which is comprised of various members of the senior and executive management team. The quantitative analysis that we conduct measures interest rate risk from both a capital and earnings perspective. With regard to earnings, movements in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve significantly influence the amount of net interest income (“NII”) that we recognize. Movements in market interest rates, and the effect of such movements on the risk factors noted above, significantly influence the spread between the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our projected NII over a one year period utilizing a static balance sheet assumption through which incoming and outgoing asset and liability cash flows are reinvested into similar instruments. Product pricing and earning asset prepayment speeds are appropriately adjusted for each rate scenario. With regard to capital, our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our Economic Value of Equity (“EVE”) to movements in interest rates. EVE represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet instruments. EVE attempts to quantify our economic value using a discounted cash flow methodology. The degree to which our EVE changes for any hypothetical interest rate scenario from its base case measurement is a reflection of our sensitivity to interest rate risk.
For both earnings and capital at risk, our interest rate risk analysis calculates a base case scenario that assumes no change in interest rates. The model then measures changes throughout a series of interest rate scenarios representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve up and down 100, 200 and 300 basis points with additional scenarios modeled where appropriate. The model requires that interest rates remain positive for all points along the yield curve for each rate scenario which may preclude the modeling of certain falling rate scenarios during periods of lower market interest rates. The level of interest rates prevalent at June 30, 2022 precluded the modeling of certain falling rate scenarios.

Changes in the composition and allocation of our balance sheet, or utilization of off-balance sheet instruments such as derivatives, can significantly alter the exposure to interest rate risk as quantified by the changes in the EVE sensitivity measures. Changes to certain external factors, most notably changes in the level of market interest rates and overall shape of the yield curve, can also alter the projected cash flows of our interest-earning assets and interest-costing liabilities and the associated present values thereof. Notwithstanding the rate change scenarios presented in the EVE and NII-based analyses above, future interest rates and their effect on net interest income are not predictable. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, prepayments and deposit run-offs and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Certain shortcomings are inherent in this type of computation. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of re-pricing, they may react at different times and in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate on certain types of assets and liabilities, such as demand deposits and savings accounts, may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, generally have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayments and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in the analyses set forth above. Additionally, an increase in credit risk may result as the ability of borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. ITEM 4.
