USE
OF MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes market and industry data that we have obtained from third-party sources, including industry publications,
as well as industry data prepared by our management on the basis of its knowledge of and experience in the industries in which we operate
(including our management’s estimates and assumptions relating to such industries based on that knowledge). Management has developed
its knowledge of such industries through its experience and participation in these industries. While our management believes the third-party
sources referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are reliable, neither we nor our management have independently verified any
of the data from such sources referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied
upon by such sources. Furthermore, internally prepared and third-party market prospective information, in particular, are estimates only
and there will usually be differences between the prospective and actual results, because events and circumstances frequently do not
occur as expected, and those differences may be material. Also, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to any publications,
reports, surveys or articles prepared by third parties should not be construed as depicting the complete findings of the entire publication,
report, survey or article. The information in any such publication, report, survey or article is not incorporated by reference in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Solely
for convenience, we refer to trademarks in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q without the ® or the ™ or symbols, but such references
are not intended to indicate that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights to our own trademarks. Other
service marks, trademarks and trade names referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, if any, are the property of their respective
owners, although for presentational convenience we may not use the ® or the ™ symbols to identify such trademarks.
OTHER
PERTINENT INFORMATION
Unless
the context otherwise indicates, when used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the terms “Global Technologies” “we,”
“us,” “our,” the “Company” and similar terms refer to Global Technologies, Ltd, a Delaware corporation,
and all of our subsidiaries and affiliates.
ii
CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2022 contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
These statements relate to future events including, without limitation, the terms, timing and closing of our proposed acquisitions or
our future financial performance. We have attempted to identify forward-looking statements by using terminology such as “anticipates,”
“believes,” “expects,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “estimates,”
“expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predict,”
“should” or “will” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only
predictions; uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any future results, levels or activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements. Our expectations are as of the date this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed, and
we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed to confirm
these statements to actual results, unless required by law.
You
should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. The cautionary statements set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
identify important factors which you should consider in evaluating our forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other
things:
●
Our
ability to effectively execute our business plan;
●
Our
ability to manage our expansion, growth and operating expenses;
●
Our
ability to protect our brands and reputation;
●
Our
ability to repay our debts;
●
Our
ability to rely on third-party suppliers outside of the United States;
●
Our
ability to evaluate and measure our business, prospects and performance metrics;
●
Our
ability to compete and succeed in a highly competitive and evolving industry;
●
Our
ability to respond and adapt to changes in technology and customer behavior;
●
Risks
in connection with completed or potential acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic growth opportunities and initiatives;
●
Risks
related to the anticipated timing of the closing of any potential acquisitions; and
●
Risks
related to the integration with regards to potential or completed acquisitions.
●
Various
risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”)
pandemic, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also contains estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by us relating to market
size and growth and other industry data. This data involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give
undue weight to such estimates. We have not independently verified the statistical and other industry data generated by independent parties
and contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness, though we do
generally believe the data to be reliable. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future
performance of the industries in which we operate are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of
factors. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including,
but not limited to, the possibility that we may fail to preserve our expertise in consumer product development; that existing and potential
distribution partners may opt to work with, or favor the products of, competitors if our competitors offer more favorable products or
pricing terms; that we may be unable to maintain or grow sources of revenue; that we may be unable maintain profitability; that we may
be unable to attract and retain key personnel; or that we may not be able to effectively manage, or to increase, our relationships with
customers; that we may have unexpected increases in costs and expenses. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially
from those expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by us.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies
This
summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s financial statements.
The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, which is responsible for their integrity and
objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and have been consistently
applied in the preparation of the financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on October 13, 2022.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Global Technologies and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash
Equivalents
Investments
having an original maturity of 90 days or less that are readily convertible into cash are considered to be cash equivalents. For the
periods presented, the Company had
no
cash equivalents. The Company has cash on deposit at one financial institution which, at times,
may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits. The Company has not experienced losses
in such accounts and periodically evaluates the creditworthiness of its financial institutions. In the future, the Company may reduce
its credit risk by placing its cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions. The Company had approximately $ 69
of
cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 of which none was held in foreign bank accounts and $ 0
was not covered by FDIC insurance
limits as of December 31, 2022.

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts :
Accounts
receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts and generally do not bear interest. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established, as
necessary, based on past experience and other factors which, in management’s judgment, deserve current recognition in estimating
bad debts. Such factors include growth and composition of accounts receivable, the relationship of the allowance for doubtful accounts
to accounts receivable and current economic conditions. The determination of the collectability of amounts due from customer accounts
requires the Company to make judgments regarding future events and trends. Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on assessing
the Company’s portfolio on an individual customer and on an overall basis. This process consists of a review of historical collection
experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, and the financial condition of Global Technologies’ customers. Based
on a review of these factors, the Company establishes or adjusts the allowance for specific customers and the accounts receivable portfolio
as a whole. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, an allowance for doubtful accounts was not considered necessary as all accounts receivable
were deemed collectible.
Accounts
receivable – related party and allowance for doubtful accounts
Accounts
receivable – related party are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances
when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances,
the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, a customer’s historical payment history, its current credit-worthiness
and current economic trends. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection.
Concentrations
of Risks
Concentration
of Accounts Receivable
–At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had $ 5,000
and $ 5,000
in accounts receivable,
respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, one customer accounted for
100 % of accounts receivable.
Concentration
of Revenues
– For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated $ 14,000
in revenue from one customer. For
the six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company generated $ 95,000
revenue.
Concentration
of Suppliers
– The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers and contract manufacturers. In particular, a single supplier
is currently the sole manufacturer of the Company’s CBD products.
Concentration
of Loans Receivable, Other
–At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Company had $ 17,533
and $ 18,380
in loans receivable,
other. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, one borrower accounted for
100 % of the Company’s total loans receivable, other. The
one borrower is controlled by the Company’s sole officer and director.
Concentration
of Notes Receivable
– The Company had notes receivable of $ 350,000  and $ 350,000  at December 31, 2022 and
June 30, 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2022, one borrower accounted for  100 % of the Company’s total notes
receivable.
Income
Taxes
In
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740 - Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset
and liability method. The asset and liability method measures deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory rates in effect at
the balance sheet date to the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts on the financial
statements. The resulting deferred tax assets or liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws as they occur. A valuation allowance
is provided when it is not more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized.
We
expect to recognize the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability that a tax authority
would sustain the position in an examination. For tax positions meeting a “more-likely-than-not” threshold, the amount to
be recognized in the financial statements will be the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority. For tax
positions not meeting the threshold, no financial statement benefit is recognized. As of December 31, 2022, we had no uncertain tax positions.
We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions as general and administrative expenses. We currently
have no federal or state tax examinations nor have we had any federal or state examinations since our inception. To date, we have not
incurred any interest or tax penalties.

Financial
Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We
adopted ASC Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis. ASC Topic 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing US GAAP that requires the use of fair value
measurements that establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.
ASC
820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC Topic 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:
Level
1:
Observable
inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level
2:
Observable
market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data
Level
3:
Unobservable
inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions.
The
carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial
assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared.
Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event
occurs. Except for the derivative liability, we had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured at fair value on a recurring
or nonrecurring basis during the periods presented.
Derivative
Liabilities
We
evaluate convertible notes payable, stock options, stock warrants and other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components
of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under the relevant sections of ASC Topic 815-40,
Derivative
Instruments and Hedging: Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity .
The
result of this accounting treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative instrument and
is marked-to-market at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability,
the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense. Upon conversion or exercise of
a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity.
Financial instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815-40 are reclassified
to a liability account at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. Please
see
NOTE I - DERIVATIVE LIABILITY
for further information.
Long-lived
Assets
Long-lived
assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment. We test for impairment losses on
long-lived assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not
be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the
future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Impairment evaluations involve
management’s estimates on asset useful lives and future cash flows. Actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from
those estimated by management which could have a material effect on our reporting results and financial positions. Fair value is determined
through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals,
as considered necessary.

the Company considers all revenues as arising from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized based on the five-step process outlined
in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606:
Step
1 – Identify the Contract with the Customer – A contract exists when (a) the parties to the contract have approved the contract
and are committed to perform their respective obligations, (b) the entity can identify each party’s rights regarding the goods
or services to be transferred, (c) the entity can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred, (d) the contract
has commercial substance and it is probably that the entity will collect substantially all of the consideration to which it will be entitled
in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.

Step
2 – Identify Performance Obligations in the Contract – Upon execution of a contract, the Company identifies as performance
obligations each promise to transfer to the customer either (a) goods or services that are distinct, or (b) a series of distinct goods
or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. To the extent a contract includes
multiple promised goods or services, the Company must apply judgement to determine whether the goods or services are capable of being
distinct within the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance
obligation.
Step
3 – Determine the Transaction Price – When (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, the Company shall recognize as
revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the performance obligation. The contract terms are used to determine
the transaction price. Generally, all contracts include fixed consideration. If a contract did include variable consideration, the Company
would determine the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price based on expected value method.
Variable consideration would be included in the transaction price, if in the Company’s judgement, it is probable that a significant
future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract would not occur.
Step
4 – Allocate the Transaction Price – After the transaction price has been determined, the next step is to allocate the transaction
price to each performance obligation in the contract. If the contract only has one performance obligation, the entire transaction price
will be applied to that obligation. If the contract has multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the performance
obligations based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) at contract inception.
Step
5 – Satisfaction of the Performance Obligations (and Recognize Revenue) – Revenue is recognized when (or as) goods or services
are transferred to a customer. The Company satisfies each of its performance obligations by transferring control of the promised good
or service underlying that performance obligation to the customer. Control is the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially
all of the remaining benefits from an asset. It includes the ability to prevent other entities from directing the use of and obtaining
the benefits from an asset. Indicators that control has passed to the customer include: a present obligation to pay; physical possession
of the asset; legal title; risks and rewards of ownership; and acceptance of the asset(s). Performance obligations can be satisfied at
a point in time or overtime.
Substantially
all of the Company’s revenues continue to be recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which is upon
shipment of the finished goods to the customer. All sales have fixed pricing and there are currently no material variable components
included in the Company’s revenue. Additionally, the Company will issue credits for defective merchandise, historically these credits
for defective merchandise have not been material. Based on the Company’s analysis of the new revenue standards, revenue recognition
from the sale of finished goods to customers, which represents substantially all of the Company’s revenues, was not impacted by
the adoption of the new revenue standards.
Service
revenue is recognized when the professional consulting, maintenance or other ancillary services are provided to the customer.

Stock-Based
Compensation
We
account for share-based awards to employees in accordance with ASC 718 “Stock Compensation”. Under this guidance, stock compensation
expense is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the estimated service
period (generally the vesting period) on the straight-line attribute method. The Company accounts for non-employee stock-based awards
in accordance with the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-07, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Under the new standard,
the Company will value all equity classified awards at their grant-date under ASC 718 and no options were required to be revalued at

We
compute net loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260. The ASC specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements
for loss per share for entities with publicly held common stock.
Basic
loss per share amounts are computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net
loss per common share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive securities (such as stock
options, warrants and convertible securities) outstanding. Dilutive securities having an anti-dilutive effect on diluted net loss per
share are excluded from the calculation. For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company excluded

Recently
Enacted Accounting Standards
In
June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13,
“Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU
2016-13”). Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326) amends guideline on reporting credit losses for assets held at
amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, Topic 326 eliminates the probable
initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit
losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets
to present the net amount expected to be collected. For available-for-sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner
similar to current GAAP, however Topic 326 will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down.
ASU 2016-13 affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net
income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures,
reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash.
The amendments in this ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our financial statements.
In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives
and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)”. This ASU reduces the number of accounting models
for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. As well as amend the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for
contracts in an entity’s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves
and amends the related EPS guidance. This standard is effective for us on May 1, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. Adoption is either a modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective method of transition. We are currently evaluating
the impact of the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on our financial statements.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
The
Company defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction
between willing parties. Financial instruments included in the Company’s financial statements include cash, accounts payable and
accrued expenses, accrued interest payable, loans payable to related parties, notes payable to third parties, notes payable to related
parties and derivative liability. Unless otherwise disclosed in the notes to the financial statements, the carrying value of financial
instruments is considered to approximate fair value due to the short maturity and characteristics of those instruments. The carrying
value of debt approximates fair value as terms approximate those currently available for similar debt instruments.

Goodwill
After
completing the purchase price allocation, any residual of cost over fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities was assigned
to the unidentifiable asset, goodwill. Formerly subject to mandatory amortization, this now is not permitted to be amortized at all,
by any allocation scheme and over any useful life. Impairment testing, using a methodology at variance with that set forth in FAS 144
(which, however, continues in effect for all other types of long-lived assets and intangibles other than goodwill), must be applied periodically,
and any computed impairment will be presented as a separate line item in that period’s income statement, as a component of income
from continuing operations (unless associated with discontinued operations, in which case, the impairment would, net of income tax effects,
be combined with the remaining effects of the discontinued operations. In accordance with Statement No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” the Company does not amortize goodwill, but performs impairment tests of the carrying value at least quarterly.

Goodwill
and Intangibles
Goodwill
is recorded when the cost of acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Intangible assets other
than goodwill are recorded at fair value at the time acquired or at cost, if applicable. Intangible assets that do not have indefinite
lives are amortized in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed. If the pattern of economic
benefit cannot be reliably determined, the intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the legal or
estimated life. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter
using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.

NOTE
D – ACQUISITION OF TCBM HOLDINGS, LLC (cont’d)
In
performing the annual impairment test, the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and
an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. For goodwill, the Company first assesses qualitative factors
to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, and whether
it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative test is required only if the Company concludes
that it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. For quantitative testing,
the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an
impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed
the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
Fair
values are determined using established business valuation techniques and models developed by the Company, estimates of market participant
assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and discount rates to value estimated cash flows. Changes in economic and operating
conditions, actual growth below the assumed market participant assumptions or an increase in the discount rate could result in an impairment
charge in a future period.
Acquisitions
Upon
acquisition of a business, the Company uses the income, market or cost approach (or a combination thereof) for the valuation as appropriate.
The valuation inputs in these models and analyses are based on market participant assumptions. Market participants are considered to
be buyers and sellers unrelated to the Company in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
Fair
value estimates are based on a series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.
Management values property, plant and equipment using the cost approach supported where available by observable market data, which includes
consideration of obsolescence. Management values acquired intangible assets using the relief from royalty method or excess earnings method,
forms of the income approach supported by observable market data for peer companies. The significant assumptions used to estimate the
value of the acquired intangible assets include discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of future cash flows (such
as revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates). Acquired inventories are marked to fair value for valuation of
the total purchase price. For certain items, the carrying value is determined to be a reasonable approximation of fair value based on
information available to the Company.

D – ACQUISITION OF TCBM HOLDINGS, LLC (cont’d)
For the six months ended December 31, 2022 and year
ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded an impairment of goodwill in the amount of $ 0
and $ 473,323 , respectively. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2021 (second calendar quarter of 2021), the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis on the TCBM Holdings,
LLC acquisition and its $ 946,646
goodwill balance based on assessed potential indicators of impairment, including recent disruptions to
the domestic CBD market resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the increasing uncertainty of near-term demand requirements, supply constraints
and financing constraints. In the previous 2020 annual goodwill impairment evaluation, this reporting unit had a fair value of approximately
100% of the carrying value. The impairment assessment and valuation method require the Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding
future operating results, cash flows, changes in working capital and capital expenditures, selling prices, profitability, and the cost
of capital. As a result of the fourth quarter 2021 goodwill impairment evaluation, the Company determined that the fair value of the TCBM
Holdings, LLC acquisition was below carrying value, including goodwill, by $ 473,323 . This was primarily due to changes in the timing and
amount of expected cash flows resulting from lower projected revenues, profitability and cash flows due to near-term reductions in the
domestic CBD market.

The Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Notes”)
contain a variable conversion feature based on the future trading price of the Company’s common stock. Therefore, the number of
shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes is indeterminate. Accordingly, we have recorded the fair value of the embedded
conversion features as a derivative liability at the respective issuance dates of the notes and charged the applicable amounts to debt
discounts (limited to the face value of the respective notes) and the remainder to other expenses. The increase (decrease) in the fair
value of the derivative liability from the respective issue dates of the notes to the measurement dates is charged (credited) to other
expense (income).
The fair value of the derivative liability was measured
at the respective issuance dates and at December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022 using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions
used for the calculation of the derivative liability of the Notes at December 31, 2022 were (1) stock price of $ 0.0001
per share, (2)
conversion price of $ 0.00005
per share, (3) term of 6 months, (4) expected volatility of
502.26 %, and (5) risk free interest rate of
4.76 %.
Assumptions used for the calculation of the derivative liability of the Notes at June 30, 2022 were (1) stock price of $ 0.0004
per share,
(2) conversion prices ranging from $ 0.0001
to $ 0.000122
per share, (3) term of
6
months to
8
months, (4) expected volatility of
305.48 %,
and (5) risk free interest rate of
0.05 % to
0.34 %.

Method of Conversion .
i.
Procedure- Before any holder of Series L Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of common stock, such holder
shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefore, duly endorsed, at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for the
Series L Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice 5 business days prior to date of conversion to the Company at its principal corporate
office, of the election to convert the same and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares
of common stock are to be issued. The Company shall, within five business days, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series
L Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of common stock
to which such holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. Conversion shall be deemed to have been effected on the date when delivery of notice
of an election to convert and certificates for shares is made, and such date is referred to herein as the “Conversion Date.”

formula:
For
retirement of debt:
One (1) share of Series L Preferred stock shall be issued for each Five Thousand Dollar ($5,000) tranche of outstanding
liability. As an example: If an officer has accrued wages due to him or her in the amount of $25,000, the officer can elect to accept

Conversion
Rights.
(a)
Automatic Conversion. Each Class B Share shall (subject to receipt of any and all necessary approvals) convert automatically into one
fully paid and non-assessable Class A Share (i) upon its sale, gift, or other transfer to a party other than a Principal Stockholder
(as defined below) or an Affiliate of a Principal Stockholder (as defined below), (ii) upon the death of the Class B Stockholder holding
such Class B Share, unless the Class B Shares are transferred by operation of law to a Principal Stockholder or an Affiliate of a Principal
Stockholder, or (iii) in the event of a sale, gift, or other transfer of a Class B Share to an Affiliate of a Principal Stockholder,
upon the death of the transferor. Each of the foregoing automatic conversion events shall be referred to hereinafter as an “Event
of Automatic Conversion.” For purposes of this ARTICLE FIVE, “Principal Stockholder” includes any of Donald H. Goldman,
Steven M. Fieldman, Lance Fieldman, Yuri Itkis, Michall Itkis and Boris Itkis and an “Affiliate of a Principal Stockholder”
is a person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control
with, the person specified. For purposes of this definition, “control,” when used with respect to any specified person, means
the power to direct or cause the direction of the management, and policies of such person, directly or indirectly, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. Without limitation, an Affiliate also includes the estate of such individual.
(b)
Voluntary Conversion. Each Class B Share shall be convertible at the option of the holder, for no additional consideration, into one
fully paid and non-assessable Class A Share at any time.
(c)
Conversion Procedure. Promptly upon the occurrence of an Event of Automatic Conversion such that Class B shares are converted automatically
into Class A Shares, or upon the voluntary conversion by the holder, the holder of such shares shall surrender the certificate or certificates
therefor, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer
agent for the Class A Shares, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office (i) stating that the shares are being converted
pursuant to an Event of Automatic Conversion into Class A Shares as provided in subparagraph 5.6(a) hereof or a voluntary conversion
as provided in subparagraph 5.6(b) hereof, (ii) specifying the Event of Automatic Conversion (and, if the occurrence of such event is
within the control of the transferor, stating the transferor’s intent to effect an Event of Automatic Conversion) or whether such
conversion is voluntary, (iii) identifying the number of Class B Shares being converted, and (iv) setting out the name or names (with
addresses) and denominations in which the certificate or certificates for Class A Shares shall be issued and including instructions for
delivery thereof. Delivery of such notice together with the certificates representing the Class B Shares shall obligate the Corporation
to issue such Class A Shares and the Corporation shall be justified in relying upon the information and the certification contained in
such notice and shall not be liable for the result of any inaccuracy with respect thereto. Thereupon, the Corporation or its transfer
agent shall promptly issue and deliver at such stated address to such holder or to the transferee of Class B Shares a certificate or
certificates for the number of Class A Shares to which such holder or transferee is entitled, registered in the name of such holder,
the designee of such holder or transferee, as specified in such notice. To the extent permitted by law, conversion pursuant to (i) an
Event of Automatic Conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as of the date on which the Event of Automatic Conversion occurred
or (ii) a voluntary conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as of the date the Corporation receives the written notice pursuant
to this subparagraph (c) (each date being the “Conversion Date”). The person entitled to receive the Class A Shares issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such Class A Shares at and as of the Conversion Date,
and the right of such person as the holder of Class B Shares shall cease and terminate at and as of the Conversion Date, in each case
without regard to any failure by the holder to deliver the certificates or the notice by this subparagraph (c).
(d)
Unconverted Shares. In the event of the conversion of fewer than all of the Class B Shares evidenced by a certificate surrendered to
the Corporation in accordance with the procedures of this Paragraph 5.6, the Corporation shall execute and deliver to or upon the written
order of the holder of such certificate, without charge to such holder, a new certificate evidencing the number of Class B Shares not
converted.

GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY
Under
ASC 205-40, we have the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about our ability to meet
our future financial obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. As required
by this standard, our evaluation shall initially not take into consideration the potential mitigating effects of our plans that have
not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued.
In
performing the first step of this assessment, we concluded that the following conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to
meet our financial obligations as they become due. We have a history of net losses: As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit
of $ 166,320,069 . For the six months ended December 31, 2022, we had cash used in operating activities of $ 324,425 . We expect to continue
to incur negative cash flows until such time as our operating segments generate sufficient cash inflows to finance our operations and
debt service requirements.
In
performing the second step of this assessment, we are required to evaluate whether our plans to mitigate the conditions above alleviate
the substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial
statements are issued. Our future plans include securing additional funding sources that may include establishing corporate partnerships,
establishing licensing revenue agreements, issuing additional convertible debentures and issuing public or private equity securities,
including selling common stock through an at-the-market facility (ATM).

(Unaudited)
NOTE
L - GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY (cont’d)
There
is no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will
be available through external sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations
or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore,
have a material effect on the business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available
on attractive terms or they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company’s existing shareholders. We have therefore
concluded there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that may result from our failure to continue as a going concern.

During the first quarter of calendar 2023, the Company received notification
from FINRA that the proposed corporate action submission, as noted within the Tersus Power Share Exchange Agreement, had passed the allotted
time for the corporate action to become effective. The Company is in the process of refiling the same corporate action. The delay on the
corporate action becoming effective has required Tersus Power to seek alternate financing and to reevaluate its business plan. There is
no guarantee that the corporate action will become effective, and as such, there is no guarantee that the transaction with Tersus Power
will be closed.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Not
required for smaller reporting companies.
Item
4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As
of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, management performed, with the participation of our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Our disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures. Based on the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that,
as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
Due
to resource constraints, material weaknesses are evident to management regarding our inability to generate all the necessary disclosure
for inclusion in our filings with the Securities and Exchanges Commission, which is due to the lack of resources and segregation of duties.
We lack sufficient personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in GAAP to meet the demands for a public
company, including the accounting skills and understanding necessary to fulfill the requirements of GAAP-based reporting. This weakness
causes us to not fully identify and resolve accounting and disclosure issues that could lead to a failure to perform timely internal
control and reviews. In addition, the Company has not established an audit committee, does not have any independent outside directors
on the Company’s Board of Directors, and lacks documentation of its internal control processes.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There
was no change to our internal controls or in other factors that could affect these controls during the period ended December 31, 2022
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. However, our
Board is currently seeking to improve our controls and procedures to remediate the deficiency described above.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item
1. Legal Proceedings
From
time to time, the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.

loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company will record a liability for the loss. I addition
to the estimated loss, the liability includes probable and estimable legal cost associated with the claim or potential claim. Litigation
is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm the Company
business. There is no pending litigation involving the Company at this time.
