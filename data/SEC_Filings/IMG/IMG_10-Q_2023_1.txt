This
report includes “forward looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),
Such forward-looking statements reflect the views of NuZee, Inc. (“NuZee” or the “Company”) with respect to future
events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain uncertainties and other factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. From time to time, our management or persons acting on our behalf may
make forward-looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about the Company. All statements other than statements
of historical facts included in this report regarding our financial position, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for
future operations, industry conditions, or any other matters, are forward-looking statements. When used in this report, forward-looking
statements are generally accompanied by terms or phrases such as “estimate,” “expects”, “project,”
“predict,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “target,” “plan,”
“intend,” “seek,” “goal,” “will,” “should,” “may” or other words
and similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Items contemplating or making assumptions about, actual
or potential future sales, market size, collaborations, and trends or operating results also constitute such forward-looking statements.
We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events,
or otherwise.
Forward-looking
statements in this report may include, without limitation, statements regarding:
●
our plans to obtain funding
for our operations, including funding necessary to develop, manufacture and commercialize our products, provide our co-packing services,
and to continue as a going concern;
●
our
expectation that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next nine months and our expectation
to need additional capital to fund our planned operations beyond that;
●
the accuracy of our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital
requirements and needs for additional financing;
●
our
expectations regarding our ability to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market;
●
the impact to our business,
including any supply chain interruptions, resulting from changes in general economic, business and political conditions, including
changes in the financial markets and macroeconomic conditions resulting from a pandemic such as COVID-19 or otherwise;
●
the evolving coffee preferences
of coffee consumers in North America and East Asia;
●
the size and growth of
the markets for our products and co-packing services;
●
our ability to compete
with companies producing similar products or providing similar co-packing services;
●
our ability to successfully
achieve the anticipated results of strategic transactions;
●
our expectation regarding
our future co-packing revenues;
●
our ability to develop
or offer innovative new products and services, and expand our co-packing services to other products that are complementary to our
current single serve coffee product offerings;
3
●
our
expectations regarding additional manufacturing, coffee roasting and co-packing capabilities to be provided through our manufacturing
partner, as well as our manufacturing partner’s ability to successfully facilitate distribution efforts to the Eastern United
States;
●
our reliance on third-party
roasters or manufacturing partners to roast coffee beans necessary to manufacture our products and to fulfill every aspect of our
co-packing services;
●
regulatory developments
in the U.S. and in non-U.S. countries;
●
our ability to retain key
management, sales and marketing personnel;
●
the scope of protection we are able to establish and maintain
for intellectual property rights covering our products and technology;
●
our ability to develop
and maintain our corporate infrastructure, including our internal control over financial reporting;
●
the outcome of pending,
threatened or future litigation; and
●
our financial performance.
The
forward-looking statements are not meant to predict or guarantee actual results, performance, events, or circumstances and may not be
realized because they are based upon our current projections, plans, objectives, beliefs, expectations, estimates and assumptions and
are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and other influences, many of which we have no control over. Actual results and the
timing of certain events and circumstances may differ materially from those described by the forward-looking statements as a result of
these risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. You should consider carefully the
statements in the section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 23, 2022, titled “Risk Factors”
and sections of this report that describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking
statements.
Readers
are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We assume
no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of
this report, other than as may be required by applicable law or regulation. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various
disclosures made by us in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission which attempt to advise interested parties of
the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. If one or more of these
risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those
expected or projected.

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
December
31, 2022
1.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of NuZee, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, referred to herein as
the “Company”, “we” or “NuZee”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 as filed with the SEC on December 23, 2022. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments, consisting of recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations
for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure
contained in the audited financial statements as reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, have
been omitted.
Reclassification
Certain
amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current period financial
statements. We reclassified lease expenses associated with subleased property from operating expenses to other expenses totaling $ 41,604
for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This reclassification had no effect on the previously reported net loss.
Principles
of Consolidation
The
Company prepares its financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts, balances and transactions have
been eliminated upon consolidation.
The
Company has two wholly owned international subsidiaries in NuZee KOREA Ltd. (“NuZee KR”) and NuZee Investment Co., Ltd. (“NuZee
INV”).
On
February 25, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), the Company acquired substantially all the assets and certain specified liabilities
(the “Acquisition”) of Dripkit, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Dripkit”), pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement,
dated as of February 21, 2022 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company, Dripkit, and Dripkit’s existing
investors (the “Stock Recipients”) who executed joinders to the Asset Purchase Agreement as of the Closing Date. Pursuant
to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the aggregate purchase price paid by the Company for the Acquisition was $ 860,000 , plus
the assumption of certain assumed liabilities, subject to certain adjustments and holdbacks as provided in the Asset Purchase Agreement.
Dripkit is engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of a single serve pour over coffee format that has a large-size single
serve pour over pack that sits on top of the cup. Dripkit operates as a new Dripkit Coffee business division that is wholly owned by
NuZee, Inc. The Company analyzed the Acquisition under ASC 805 and concluded that it should be accounted for as a business combination.
The Acquisition has been included in the Company’s financial statements from the date of the Acquisition.
10
2022
Reverse Stock Split
On
December 28, 2022 , we completed a
l-for-35 reverse stock split , which became effective on
December 28, 2022 upon acceptance of the Company’s filing of
an amendment to the Company’s
Articles of Incorporation, as amended,
with the Secretary of State of Nevada (the “Reverse Stock Split”). Accordingly,
each holder of common stock received one share of common stock for every 35 shares such stockholder held immediately prior to the effectiveness
of the Reverse Stock Split.
All
share and per share information included in these financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted to give effect
to the Reverse Stock Split.
Earnings
per Share
Basic
earnings per common share is equal to net earnings or loss divided by the weighted average of shares outstanding during the reporting
period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options, warrants and other commitments
to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings
of the Company. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the total number of common stock equivalents was
262,030
and
250,471 ,
respectively, comprised of stock options and warrants as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Company incurred a net loss
for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and therefore basic and diluted earnings per share for these periods
are the same because all potential common equivalent shares would be antidilutive.
Going
Concern and Capital Resources
Since
its inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, research and development, recruiting management
and technical staff, acquiring operating assets, raising capital and
the commercialization and
manufacture of its single serve coffee products . The Company has grown revenues from its principal operations; however, there
is no assurance of future revenue growth similar to historical levels.
As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of $ 6,491,819
and working capital of $ 6,781,959 . The Company has not attained profitable operations
since inception.
The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which contemplates continuation
of the Company as a going concern. The Company has had limited revenues, recurring losses and an accumulated deficit. These items raise
substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company’s continued existence
is dependent upon management’s ability to develop profitable operations and to raise additional capital for the further development
and marketing of the Company’s products and business.

Lease
In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to provide guidance on recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities
on the consolidated balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements, specifically differentiating between different
types of leases. The Company implemented ASU No. 2016-02 on October 1, 2019.
The
Company performs a quarterly analysis of leases to determine if there are any operating leases that require recognition under ASC 842.
The Company has a long-term operating lease for office and manufacturing space in Plano, Texas. The leased property in Plano, Texas,
has a remaining lease term through June 2024. The lease has an option to extend beyond the stated termination date, but exercise of this
option is not probable. The Company did not apply the recognition requirements of ASC 842 to operating leases with a remaining lease
term of 12 months or less.
In
May 2022, the Company renewed the office and manufacturing space in Vista, California which was scheduled to expire on January 31, 2023,
through
March 31, 2025 . The lease has a monthly base rent of $ 8,451 , plus common area expenses. Along with the extension,
we leased an
additional
1,796
square feet that has a monthly base rent of $ 2,514
through
March 31, 2025. We extended our sub-leased property in Vista,
California, through
January 31, 2023 . The lease has a monthly rent of $ 2,111
and has been calculated as a ROU Asset co-terminus with
the direct-leased property. The Company leased a new larger office and manufacturing space in Seoul, Korea beginning November 15, 2021,
through November 15, 2023. The lease has a monthly expense of $ 7,040 . Accordingly, we have added ROU assets and lease liabilities related
to those leases at December 31, 2022.
Effective
December 1, 2022, we entered into a new operating lease for our principal executive office, which is located at 1350 East Arapaho Road,
Suite #230, Richardson, Texas 75081. We lease the Richardson office on an annual basis, at a cost of $ 1,510
per month, through November
30, 2023.
12
As
of December 31, 2022, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of
1.5
years and a weighted-average discount rate
of
5.0 %. Other information related to our operating leases is as follows:

packing equipment. The terms of this agreement require us to pay $ 2,987
per month through July 2024. As part of this agreement, Alliance
Funding Group provided our equipment supplier with $ 124,500
for the purchase of this equipment. This transaction was accounted for as
a finance lease. As of December 31, 2022, our finance lease had a remaining lease term of

Revenue
Recognition
In
May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (Topic 606) “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” Topic
606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605 “Revenue Recognition” (Topic 605). The new standard’s
core principle is that an entity will recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be
entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The principles in the standard are applied in five steps: 1) Identify
the contract(s) with a customer; 2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) Determine the transaction price; 4) Allocate
the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance
obligation. We adopted Topic 606 as of October 1, 2018, on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements, including the presentation of revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Foreign
Currency Translation
The
financial position and results of operations of each of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the foreign subsidiary’s
local currency as the functional currency. Revenues and expenses of each such subsidiary have been translated into U.S. dollars at average
exchange rates prevailing during the period. Assets and liabilities have been translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet
date. The resulting translation gain and loss adjustments are recorded directly as a separate component of stockholders’ equity
unless there is a sale or complete liquidation of the underlying foreign investment. Foreign currency translation adjustments recorded
to other comprehensive income amounted to $ 115,583
and $ 32,688
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Transaction
gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency
are included in the results of operations as incurred.

Prepaid
expenses and other current assets
Prepaid
expenses and other current assets at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, were as follows:

The

of $ 547,773
as of September 30, 2022 primarily consists of deposits on inventory and a retainer for professional services.
Inventories
Inventory,
consisting principally of raw materials, work in process and finished goods held for production and sale, is stated at the lower of cost
or net realizable value, cost being determined using the weighted average cost method. The Company reviews inventory levels at least
quarterly and records a valuation allowance when appropriate. At December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the carrying value of inventory
was $ 1,089,901
and
$ 947,995 ,

Equity Method Investment
On
January 9, 2020, a joint venture agreement was signed between Industrial Marino, S.A. de C.V. ( 50 %) and the Company ( 50 %) forming NuZee
LATIN AMERICA (NLA), S.A. de C.V. NLA was formed pursuant to the laws of Mexico, with corporate domicile in Mazatlan, Mexico. As part
of the capitalization of NLA, the Company contributed two co-packing machines to the joint venture. These machines had an aggregate carrying
cost of $ 313,012 . The Company received $ 110,000
in cash for this contribution and recorded an investment in NLA of $ 160,000
and a loss
of $ 43,012
on the contribution of the machines to NLA.
The Company accounts for NLA using the equity method of accounting since the management of day-to-day operations at NLA ultimately lies
with the Company’s joint venture partner as the operations of NLA are based in its partners facilities and our partner
appoints the Chairman of the joint board of directors of NLA. As of December 31, 2022, the only activities in NLA were the
contribution of two machines, as described above, and start up and initial marketing and sales activities. $ 1,823
and $ 1,157
of losses were recognized under the equity method of accounting during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31,
2021, respectively.
2.
GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION
The
Company is organized based on fundamentally one business segment although it does sell its products on a world-wide basis. The Company
is organized in three geographical segments. The Company co-packs product for customers and produces and sells its products directly
in North America and Korea. The Company previously had a minimally staffed office in Japan that provided support for import and export
of product and materials between the U.S. and Japan, as well as investor relations support to its stockholders based in Japan; these
functions are now supported by the Company’s personnel residing in the United States. Information about the Company’s geographic
operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
As
described in Note 1, on February 25, 2022, the Company acquired substantially all the assets and certain specified liabilities of Dripkit
pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 21, 2022, by and among the Company, Dripkit, and Dripkit’s existing
investors who executed joinders to the Asset Purchase Agreement as of the Closing Date. Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement,
the aggregate purchase price paid by the Company for the Acquisition was $ 860,000 , consisting of
cash
paid by the Company to Dripkit and the Company’s issuance to the Stock Recipients of shares of the Company’s common stock,
plus the assumption of certain assumed liabilities, including a $ 13,000
bridge loan and approximately $ 3,176
of payables, subject
to certain adjustments and holdbacks as provided in the Asset Purchase Agreement resulting in an acquisition accounting purchase price
of $ 876,176 . The Company analyzed the Acquisition under ASC 805 and concluded that it should be accounted for as a business combination.
Pursuant
to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, on the Closing Date,
the cash portion of the purchase price was reduced by the following
amounts: (a) $ 22,000 , in satisfaction of a bridge loan made from the Company to Dripkit in February 2022 to provide Dripkit with operational
financing prior to the Closing Date, (b) $ 35,500 , as an indemnity holdback for the purpose of satisfying any indemnification claims made
by the Company pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, and (c) $ 40,000 , as a cash bulk sales holdback (the “Cash Bulk Sales Holdback
Amount”).
In addition, on the Closing Date, the Company held back $ 40,000
worth of stock consideration as the Stock Bulk Sales
Holdback Amount (together with the Cash Bulk Sales Holdback Amount, the “Bulk Sales Holdback Amount”).

Intangibles
The
Company identified tradename and customer relationships as intangible assets in connection with the Acquisition. Any tradename and
customer relationship intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. The
goodwill recognized resulted from such factors as an assembled workforce and management’s industry know-how. During the year
ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $ 531,412
related to goodwill, resulting in a $ 0
goodwill balance as of September 30, 2022. During the year ended September 30, 2022, we also recorded non-cash impairment charges
for the Dripkit tradename and acquired customer relationships of $ 80,555
and $ 63,167 ,
respectively. See Note 4—Intangible Assets for additional information on our tradename intangible assets, which were the only
intangible assets remaining as of December 31, 2022.
The
consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 includes revenues of $ 42,159 , net loss of $ 101,806 , and amortization expense of $ 7,500 , contributed by Dripkit.

Item
2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview
We
are a specialty coffee company and, we believe, a leading co-packer of single serve pour over coffee in the United States, as well as
a preeminent co-packer of coffee brew bags, which is also referred to as tea-bag style coffee. In addition to our single serve pour over
and coffee brew bag coffee products, we have recently expanded our product portfolio to offer a third type of single serve coffee format,
DRIPKIT pour over products, as a result of our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Dripkit, Inc. (“Dripkit”).
Our DRIPKIT pour over format features a large-size single serve pour over pack that sits on top of the cup and delivers in our view a
barista-quality coffee experience to customers in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Our mission is to leverage our position as a
co-packer at the forefront of the North American single serve coffee market to revolutionize the way single serve coffee is enjoyed in
the United States. While the United States is our core market, we also have manufacturing and sales operations in Korea and a joint venture
in Latin America.
We
believe we are the only commercial-scale producer within the North American market that has the dual capacity to pack both single serve
pour over coffee and coffee brew bag coffee. We intend to leverage our position to become the commercial coffee manufacturer of choice
and aim to become the preeminent leader for coffee companies seeking to enter into and grow within the single serve coffee market in
North America. We are paid per-package based on the number of single serve coffee products produced by us. Accordingly, we consider our
business model to be a form of tolling arrangement, as we receive a fee for almost every single serve coffee product our co-packing customers
sell in the North American and Korean markets. While we financially benefit from the success of our co-packing customers through the
sales of their respective single serve coffee products, we believe we are also able to avoid the risks associated with owning and managing
the product and its related inventory.
We
have also developed and sell NuZee branded single serve coffee products, including our flagship Coffee Blenders line of both single
serve pour over coffee and coffee brew bag coffee products, which we believe offers consumers some of the best coffee available in a
single serve application in the world. We have recently expanded our Coffee Blenders offerings to include a new Coldpresso latte
product line that is available to purchase in Korea and online. We offer DRIPKIT pour over packs direct to consumers through our
website, wholesale business-to-business to hospitality customers, and co-pack for coffee roasters.
We
may also consider co-packaging other products that are complementary to our current product offerings and provide us with a deeper access
to our customers. In addition, we are continually exploring potential strategic partnerships, co-ventures, and mergers, acquisitions,
or other transactions with existing and future business partners to generate additional business, drive growth, reduce manufacturing
costs, expand our product portfolio, enter into new markets, and further penetrate the markets in which we currently operate. Our goal
is to continue to expand our product portfolio to raise our visibility, consumer awareness and brand profile.
20
2022
Reverse Stock Split
On
December 9, 2022, our stockholders approved a proposal granting the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”)
discretionary authority to file an amendment (the “Certificate of Amendment”) to our Articles of Incorporation, as
amended (the “Articles”), which amends the Articles to add a Section 1A to effect a reverse stock split of our common
stock, at any ratio from 1-for-10 to 1-for-50 at the Board’s discretion. On December 21, 2022, the Board approved a 1-for-35
reverse stock split of our common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Certificate of Amendment was filed by the
Company on December 28, 2022 and became effective upon acceptance of the Company’s filing of the Certificate of Amendment with
the Secretary of State of Nevada. Accordingly, each holder of our common stock received one share of common stock for every 35
shares such stockholder held immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split.
Impact
of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The
ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the international and United States economies,
financial markets and supply chains. We do not believe, however, that these disruptions had a significant effect on our business or results
of operations to date, and in some cases, we have been able to mitigate any adverse effects in part by sourcing coffee and other supplies
from alternative suppliers in the United States. The COVID-19 crisis may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results
going forward that we are not currently able to fully determine or quantify. The COVID-19 crisis may adversely affect the ability of
our customers to pay for goods delivered on a timely basis, or at all. Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability
of accounts receivable will adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations, requiring an increased level of working capital.
Geographic
Concentration
Our
operations are primarily split between two geographic areas: North America and South Korea.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, net revenues attributable to our operations in North America totaled $665,741 compared to $817,341
of net revenues attributable to our operations in North America for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, as of December
31, 2022, $303,835 of our property and equipment, net was attributable to our North American operations, compared to $378,546 attributable
to our North American operations as of September 30, 2022.
For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, net revenues attributable to our operations in South Korea totaled $470,607 compared to $201,912
of net revenues attributable to our operations in South Korea during the three months ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, as of December
31, 2022, $170,033 of our property and equipment, net was attributable to our Korean operations, compared to $144,865 attributable to
our Korean operations as of September 30, 2022.
Results
of Operations
On
February 25, 2022, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain specified liabilities of Dripkit (the “Acquisition”).
Our results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 includes the operations of Dripkit. The Acquisition of Dripkit
did not contribute to the periods prior to its acquisition in our financial statements, which therefore impacts comparisons to 2021 for
our results of operations in the discussion that follows.

For
the three months ended December 31, 2022, our revenue increased by $117,095, or approximately 11%, compared with the three months ended
December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily related to increased revenue in South Korea, driven by a new co-packing arrangement with
a new customer in South Korea and increased orders from an existing significant customer in South Korea in the three months ended December
31, 2022 .

months ended December 31, 2022, and 2% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. This increase in gross profit was driven primarily
by decreased material and labor costs. As discussed above, sales attributable to our operations in South Korea for the period ended December
31, 2022 increased as compared to the same period in 2021 and, as a result, in the three months ended December 31, 2022 we utilized more
material and labor generated in South Korea where the costs for those services are lower than in North America.

22
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
Since
our inception in 2011, we have incurred significant losses, and as of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately
$67 million. We have not yet achieved profitability and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant sales and marketing expenses
prior to recording sufficient revenue from our operations to offset these expenses. In the United States, we expect to incur additional
losses because of the costs associated with operating as an exchange-listed public company. We are unable to predict the extent of any
future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all.
To
date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from registered public offerings and private placements of shares of our
common stock and other equity securities. Our principal use of cash is to fund our operations, which includes the commercialization of
our single serve coffee products, the continuation of efforts to improve our products, administrative support of our operations and other
working capital requirements.
As
of December 31, 2022, we had a cash balance of $6,491,819.
Considering our current cash resources and our current and expected levels of operating expenses, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least nine months from February 13, 2023 but expect to need additional capital to fund our planned operations beyond that. This evaluation is based on relevant conditions and events that are currently known or reasonably knowable. A reduction in consumer
demand for, or revenues from the sale of, our single serve coffee products could further constrain our cash resources. We have based
these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating projections, including our projected revenues from sales
of our single serve coffee products, may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us.
In
the future, we may receive additional funds upon the exercise for cash of outstanding warrants, if and when exercised for cash at the
election of the warrant holders, including the Series A warrants (the “Series A Warrants”) and Series B warrants (the “Series
B Warrants” and, collectively with the Series A Warrants, the “2021 Warrants”) that were issued by us in March 2021
in an underwritten registered public offering and the 2022 warrants (the “2022 Warrants”) that were issued by us in an April
2022 offering pursuant to Securities Act registration exemptions under Regulation S and/or Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The
2021 Warrant holders are obligated to pay the exercise price ($157.46 in the case of the Series A Warrants and $204.69 in the case of
the Series B Warrants) in cash upon exercise of the 2021 Warrants unless we fail to maintain a current prospectus relating to the common
stock issuable upon the exercise of the 2021 Warrants (in which case, the 2021 Warrants may only be exercised via a “cashless”
exercise provision). Each 2022 Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $69.98.
The 2022 Warrant holders may exercise their 2022 Warrants on a “cashless” basis pursuant to a formula set forth in the form
of 2022 Warrant.
We
intend to seek to raise additional capital, including through public or private equity offerings, to support our operating activities
for the next twelve months and beyond, and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. The timing and amount
of funds that we will need to raise will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to generate a sufficient amount of revenues
from the sale of our single serve coffee products to fund our business operations and the timing and amount of funds received upon the
exercise for cash of outstanding warrants by the warrant holders. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue, we may seek to
raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness,
such indebtedness would have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our
operations. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders.
While
we believe our plans to raise additional funds will alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern, these plans are not entirely within our control and cannot be assessed as being probable of occurring at this time.
If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations and ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely
affected.
If
we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise additional capital, based on our current and expected levels of operating expenses, our current
capital is not expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months from February 13, 2023. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
23
Contractual
Obligations
Our
significant contractual cash requirements as of December 31, 2022, primarily include payments for operating and finance lease liabilities
and principal and interest on loans. Additionally, we may incur purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable
and legally binding and enter into enforceable agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms, including
fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and fixed or estimated prices to be paid at the time of settlement. As of December 31, 2022,
we had payments for lease and loan obligations of approximately $636,040, of which $429,448 are payable within 12 months as of December
31, 2022. We had no purchase obligations as of December 31, 2022.

5—Issuance of Equity Securities ” to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements that have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. US GAAP provides the framework
from which to make these estimates, assumption and disclosures. We choose accounting policies within US GAAP that management believes
are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in a consistent manner. Management regularly
assesses these policies in light of current and forecasted economic conditions. See Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our accounting policies.
There
were no significant and material changes in our critical accounting policies and use of estimates during the three months ended December
31, 2022, as compared to those disclosed in “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates ” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September
30, 2022, filed with the SEC on December 23, 2022.

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this
item.
Item
4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is collected and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive
Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for our
Company. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that no matter how well conceived
and operated, disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure
controls and procedures are met.
Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Evaluation Date”). Based upon that evaluation,

PART
II.
Item
1. Legal Proceedings
Next
Vision Litigation
As
previously disclosed, on November 23, 2021, Next Vision, Inc. (the “Consultant”) filed a complaint against the Company in
the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego Central Division (Case No. 37-2021-00049557-CU-BC-CTL) (the “Next Vision
Complaint”). The Next Vision Complaint alleges that the Company’s delay in issuing shares of the Company’s common stock
(the “Shares”) to the Consultant after receiving due notice from the Consultant of its intent to exercise vested stock options
to acquire 70,000 Shares, as initially granted in 2018 (or, as adjusted to account for the reverse stock splits effected by the Company
on each of November 12, 2019 and
December 28, 2022 , vested stock options to acquire 667
Shares) (the “Options”), which had previously been issued to the Consultant as compensation for consulting services provided
in 2018, breached express and implied contractual obligations to the Consultant and resulted in the Company reporting an overstated amount
of income on the IRS Form 1099-B that was issued to the Consultant for U.S. federal tax purposes. In addition, the Next Vision Complaint
alleges that the 667 Shares issued to the Consultant upon exercise of the Options improperly contained a six-month restriction on resale
and that such restriction prevented the Consultant from selling the Shares at the desired time. The Next Vision Complaint seeks compensatory
damages, including to recover for alleged lost profits due to the alleged improper six-month restriction on resale for the Shares, as
well as punitive damages, costs of suit, attorney’s fees and interest.
On
January 20, 2022, the Company filed its general denial and answer in which it raised affirmative defenses and disputed the claims contained
in the Next Vision Complaint. On November 29, 2022, the parties engaged in Court-ordered mediation but did not resolve the matter. The
Court has set a trial date for August 11, 2023.
We
believe the allegations set forth in the Next Vision Complaint are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against the allegations.
However, the Company is not able to predict the outcome, and there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in its defense.
Steeped,
Inc. Litigation
As
previously disclosed, on June 27, 2019, Steeped, Inc. d/b/a Steeped Coffee (the “Plaintiff”) filed a complaint (the “First
Steeped Complaint”) against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the “District
Court”), alleging that the Company’s promotion of certain coffee products and services during a trade show in 2019 constituted
an infringement upon the Plaintiff’s registered trademark. In May 2021, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the
Plaintiff, pursuant to which the Company denied the allegations in the First Steeped Complaint, denied any liability arising therefrom,
and agreed to pay $35,000 to resolve all claims asserted by the Plaintiff (the “Settlement Agreement”). As a result, a Joint
Stipulation and Order for Dismissal was filed with the District Court on May 21, 2021, and the Order of the Court dismissing the case
was entered on the same day. On January 27, 2023, the Plaintiff filed a new complaint against the Company in the Superior Court of California,
Santa Cruz County (Case No. 23CV00234) (the “New Steeped Complaint”). The New Steeped Complaint alleges causes of action
for breach of contract and intentional interference with contractual relations related to the Company’s alleged breach of the Settlement
Agreement. Plaintiff seeks a trial by jury and relief in the form of a permanent injunction for use of “Steep Coffee” or
any confusingly similar variant of “STEEPED COFFEE”; the impoundment and destruction of allegedly infringing goods; a final
judgment for all profits derived from the Company’s allegedly unlawful conduct, actual damages, treble damages for alleged willful
infringement; damages to the Plaintiff’s reputation and goodwill; damages due to the Company’s alleged destabilization of
the market and price erosion; and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. The Company has not yet been served or filed a responsive
pleading. The Company believes the claims are defensible, and that the damages do not align with the asserted causes of action or are
otherwise not sustainable. However, the Company is not able to predict the outcome, and there is no assurance that the Company will be
successful in any defense or counterclaim.

Curtin
Litigation
On
January 6, 2023, a former employee of the Company, Rosaline Curtin (“Ms. Curtin”), filed a complaint against the Company
and another former employee of the Company, Jose Ramirez (“Mr. Ramirez”), in the Superior Court of California, County of
San Diego (Case No. 37-2023-00000841-CU-WT-NC) (the “Curtin Complaint”). The Curtin Complaint alleges that Ms. Curtin was
subject to harassment by her supervisor, Mr. Ramirez, and gender discrimination throughout her employment, that she reported this discrimination
and harassment to the Company, and that the Company retaliated against her and wrongfully terminated her for whistleblowing and failed
to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. The Curtin Complaint seeks compensatory damages, including loss of past, present
and future earnings, and benefits, as well as punitive damages, penalties, attorney’s fees and costs and interest. The Company’s
deadline to respond or remove the case to federal court is February 23, 2023. We believe the allegations set forth in the Curtin Complaint
are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against the allegations. However, the Company is not able to predict the outcome, and
there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in its defense.
From
time to time, we may be subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. The results of any future litigation
cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and
settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.
