Description of Business and
Summary of
Significant
Accounting Policies
Description of Business
In this quarterly report on Form
10 -Q, Mesa Laboratories, Inc., a Colorado corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is collectively referred to as “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “Mesa.”
We are a multinational manufacturer, developer, and seller of life science tools and critical quality control products and services, many of which are sold into niche markets that are driven by regulatory requirements. We have manufacturing operations in the United States and Europe, and our products are marketed by our sales personnel in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, and by independent distributors in these areas as well as throughout the rest of the world. We prefer markets in which we can establish a strong presence and achieve high gross profit margins.
As of
December 31, 2022 , we managed our operations in
four
reportable segments, or divisions:
● Clinical Genomics
- develops, manufactures, and sells highly sensitive, low-cost, high-throughput genetic analysis tools used by clinical labs to perform genomic clinical testing in several therapeutic areas, such as screenings for hereditary diseases, pharmacogenetics and oncology related applications.
●
Sterilization and Disinfection Control
- manufactures and sells biological, cleaning, and chemical indicators which are used to assess the effectiveness of sterilization and disinfection processes in the hospital, medical device, and pharmaceutical industries. The division also provides testing and laboratory services, mainly to the dental industry.
●
Biopharmaceutical Development  - develops, manufactures, and sells automated systems for protein analysis (immunoassays) and peptide synthesis solutions. Immunoassays and peptide synthesis solutions accelerate the discovery, development, and manufacture of biotherapeutic drugs.
●
Calibration Solutions  - develops, manufactures, and sells quality control and calibration products used to measure or calibrate temperature, pressure, pH, humidity, and other chemical or physical parameters for health and safety purposes, primarily in hospital, medical device manufacturing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and various laboratory environments.
Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information. In the opinion of management, such unaudited information includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of our financial position and results of operations. The results of operations for the interim periods are
not
necessarily indicative of results that
may
be achieved for the entire year. The year-end Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does
not
include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We made
no
material changes to the application of our significant accounting policies that were disclosed in our Form
10 -K. This quarterly report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on Form
10 -K for the year ended
March 31, 2022 .
Our fiscal year ends on
March  31.
References in this Quarterly Report to a particular “year” or “year-end” mean our fiscal year, references to the
first
quarter of fiscal year
2023  refer to the period from
April 1, 2022  through
June 30, 2022,  references to the
second

Prior Period Reclassification
Certain amounts presented for prior periods in Note
3.
"Revenue Recognition" have been reclassified. Certain revenues related to the Biopharmaceutical Development division have been reclassified out of revenues from consumables and into revenues from hardware and services. Certain revenues related to the Clinical Genomics division have been reclassified out of revenues from hardware and into revenues from consumables. These reclassifications have
not
resulted in any change to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for and periods presented in this Form
10 -Q.
Risks and Uncertainties
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the reporting date and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates represent management's judgment about the outcome of future events. The business and economic uncertainty resulting from supply chain challenges, cost pressure, the overall effects of the current high inflation environment on customers' purchasing patterns, and the novel coronavirus pandemic ("COVID- 19" ) has made such estimates more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
We have reviewed all recently issued accounting pronouncements and have concluded that they are either
not
applicable to us or are
not
expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Note
2 . Significant Transactions
Belyntic GmbH
During the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022,
we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Belyntic GmbH’s peptide purification business (“the Belyntic acquisition”) for $ 6,450 , of which $ 4,950  was paid on the date of acquisition and the remainder will be paid upon approval of patent applications expected in the next
36
months. The business complements our existing peptide synthesis business, part of the Biopharmaceutical Development segment, by adding a new consumables line. During the
third
quarter of fiscal year
2023 ,  we prepared a preliminary analyses of the valuation of net assets acquired in the Belyntic acquisition. This preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed
Agena Bioscience, Inc
On
October 20, 2021,
we completed the acquisition of Agena Bioscience, Inc. (“Agena”) for $ 300,793 , net of cash acquired but inclusive of working capital adjustments (the “Agena Acquisition”). The Agena Acquisition aligned with our overall acquisition strategy, moved our business towards the life sciences tools sector, and expanded our market opportunities, particularly in Asia. Agena is a leading clinical genomics tools company that develops, manufactures, markets, and supports proprietary instruments and related consumables and services that enable genetic analysis for a broad range of diagnostic and research applications. Using Agena's MassARRAY® instruments and chemical reagent solutions, customers can analyze DNA samples for a variety of high volume clinical testing applications, such as inherited genetic disease testing, pharmacogenetics, various oncology tests, infectious disease testing, and other highly differentiated applications.
We funded the acquisition and transactions relating thereto with cash on hand and borrowings under the Credit Facility (as defined below). Of the cash consideration we paid, approximately $ 267,000
represented cash consideration to holders of Agena’s preferred and common stock, approximately $ 2,000
represented cash consideration paid for the settlement of Agena’s warrants, and approximately $ 31,800
represented cash consideration for the settlement of Agena's vested stock options as of the closing date.
Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired
The allocation of purchase price is based on the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, based on the final valuation of Agena. We have made appropriate adjustments to deferred taxes and tax-related balances during the
three
months ended
December 31. 2022.
The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price as of
October 20, 2021:

Note
3.
Revenue Recognition
We develop, manufacture, market, sell and maintain life sciences tools and quality control instruments and related software, consumables, and services. We evaluate revenues internally based primarily on operating segment and the nature of goods and services provided.
Hardware sales include physical products such as instruments used for molecular and genetic analysis, protein synthesizers, medical meters, wireless sensor systems, and data loggers. Hardware sales
may  be offered with accompanying perpetual or annual software licenses, which in some cases are required for the hardware to function.
Consumables are typically used on a  one -time basis and require frequent replacement in our customers' operating cycles. Consumables such as reagents used for molecular and genetic analysis or solutions used for protein synthesis are critical to the ongoing use of our instruments. Consumables such as biological indicator test strips are used on a standalone basis.
We offer service and maintenance contracts for our instruments, which
may
contain performance obligations satisfied: over time, such as an obligation to perform repairs or replace parts as needed over a contractually-specified period of time; upon completion of a discrete service, such as stand-alone maintenance services or discrete services within annual contracts; or, in many cases, both.
Typically, revenue is recognized upon shipment of a product, upon completion of a discrete service, or over a period of time reflective of the performance obligation period in the applicable contract, depending on when our obligation to the customer is satisfied. The significant majority of our revenues and related receivables are generated from contracts with customers that are  12  months or less in duration.
The following tables present disaggregated revenues for the
three

Contract Balances
Our contracts have varying payment terms and conditions. Some customers prepay for products and services, resulting in unearned revenues or customer deposits, called contract liabilities. Short-term contract liabilities are included within other accrued expenses and unearned revenues in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and long-term contract liabilities are included within other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
A summary of contract liabilities is as follows:
Contract liabilities as of March 31, 2022
$ 15,069
Prior year liabilities recognized in revenues during the nine months ended December 31, 2022
( 7,927 )
Contract liabilities added during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net of revenues recognized
9,091
Contract liabilities balance as of December 31, 2022
$ 16,233
Contract liabilities primarily relate to service contracts with original expected service durations of
12
months or less and will be recognized to revenue over time as our performance obligations are satisfied.
Note

Fair Value Measurements
Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, obligations under trade accounts payable, and debt. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying values for cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, and trade accounts payable approximate fair value. We measure our cash equivalents at fair value using quoted market prices in an active market, and we classify them within Level
1
of the fair value hierarchy.
Historically, the financial instruments that subject us to the highest concentration of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. It is our policy to invest in highly liquid cash equivalent financial instruments with high credit ratings and to maintain low single issuer exposure (except U.S. treasuries). Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to customers to which we make significant sales. We reserve an allowance for potential write-offs of accounts receivable using historical collection experience and current and expected future economic and market conditions, but we have
not
written off any significant accounts to date. To manage credit risk, we consider the creditworthiness of new and existing customers, and we regularly review outstanding balances and payment histories. We
may  require pre-payments from customers under certain circumstances and
may  limit future purchases until payments are made on past due amounts.
We have outstanding $ 172,500  aggregate principal of  1.375 % convertible senior notes due
August 15, 2025 ( the "Notes"). We estimate the fair value of the Notes based on the last actively traded price or observable market input preceding the end of the reporting period and the fair value is approximately correlated to our stock price. The estimated fair value and carrying value of the Notes were as follows:
December 31, 2022
March 31, 2022
Carrying Value
Fair Value (Level 2)
Carrying Value
Fair Value (Level 2)
Notes
$ 170,044     $ 157,191     $ 169,365     $ 185,438
Assets recognized or disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property and equipment, operating lease assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. During the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022,
in response to the loss of a significant customer, we used Level
3
inputs to test the recoverability of the Clinical Genomics division’s intangible asset group and evaluate the division’s goodwill for impairment in response to the loss of a significant customer. After considering all information available to us as of the date of testing, we concluded that
no
impairment is indicated. Fair values preliminarily assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Belyntic acquisition were measured using Level
3
inputs, and are subject to change. There were
no
transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during the
three
and
nine  months ended
December 31, 2022  or
2021,
respectively.

Credit Facility
We maintain a senior credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that includes
1 ) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 75,000 ,  2 ) a swingline loan in an aggregate principal amount  not  exceeding $ 5,000 , and  3 ) letters of credit in an aggregate stated amount  not  exceeding $ 2,500 .  The Credit Facility matures in
March 2025.
The Credit Facility also provides for an incremental term loan or an increase in revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of at a minimum $ 25,000  and at a maximum $ 75,000 , subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and lender considerations. As of
December 31, 2022 , we had $ 19,000
outstanding under the Credit Facility.
On
December 22, 2022,
Mesa and the financial institutions amended the Credit Facility to replace references to the Eurodollar Rate with references to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR").
Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility bear interest at either a base rate or a SOFR rate, plus an applicable spread. We are obligated to pay quarterly unused commitment fees of between
0.15 % and
0.35 % of the Credit Facility’s aggregate principal amount, based on our leverage ratio.
The financial covenants in the Credit Facility include a maximum leverage ratio of  5.0  to  1.0  for the period ended
December 31, 2022 , except that we
may  have a leverage ratio of  5.75  to  1.0  for a period of  four  consecutive quarters following a permitted acquisition. The Credit Facility also stipulates a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of  1.25  to  1.0.  Other covenants include restrictions on our ability to incur debt, grant liens, make fundamental changes, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, or conduct asset sales. As of
December 31, 2022 , we were in compliance with all covenants.
Convertible Notes
On
August 12, 2019,
we issued an aggregate principal amount of $ 172,500
of Notes. The net proceeds from the Notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other related offering expenses payable by us, were approximately
$167,056.  The Notes mature on
August 15, 2025,
unless earlier repurchased or converted, and bear interest at a rate of
1.375 % payable semi-annually in arrears on
February 15
and
August 15
each year.
Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case
may
be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. Our current intent is to settle conversions entirely in shares of common stock. We will reevaluate this policy from time to time as we receive conversion notices from note holders. The circumstances necessary for conversion were
not
met during the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022 . As of
December 31, 2022 , the Notes are classified as a long-term liability on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the circumstances necessary for conversion were
not
satisfied as of the end of the period. The if-converted value of the Notes did
not
exceed the principal balance as of
December 31, 2022 .
The net carrying amount of the Notes was as follows:
December 31, 2022
March 31, 2022
Principal outstanding
$ 172,500     $ 172,500
Unamortized debt issuance costs

Balances for PSUs are reflected at target.
( 2 )
During the
nine  months ended
December 31, 2022,
the fiscal year
2020  PSUs vested and were distributed at
126 % of target, based on actual performance results and completion of service conditions.
The outstanding time-based RSUs vest and settle in shares of our common stock on a  one -for- one
basis. Substantially all of the RSUs granted during the
nine  months ended
December 31, 2022  vest in equal installments on the first, second, and
third
anniversary of the grant date. We recognize the expense relating to RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
PSUs vest upon completion of the service period described in the award agreement and based on achievement of the performance targets described in the award agreements. We recognize the expense relating to the performance-based RSUs based on the probable outcome of achievement of the performance targets on a straight-line basis over the service period.
During the
nine  months ended
December 31, 2022 , the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors created a plan to award  19  PSUs at target (the
"FY23
PSUs") that are subject to both service and performance conditions to eligible employees. The performance period for the
FY23
PSUs is from
April 1, 2022
until
March 31, 2023
and the service period is from
April 1, 2022
until
March 31, 2025.
Of the total
FY23
PSUs granted,
13
vest based on our achievement of specific performance criteria during fiscal year
2023
and they have a grant date fair value of $ 185.57 . Based on actual performance through the
nine
months ended
December 31, 2022,
we reduced the number of awards expected to vest. The remaining
6
awards will be settled in shares of our common stock, but they are subject to performance criteria that are subjective and as such do
not
have a grant date. The awards will be marked-to-market each reporting period during the performance period and have a fair value of $ 166.21
per share as of
December 31, 2022.  The quantity of shares that will be issued upon vesting will range from  0 % to  200 % of the targeted number of shares; if the defined minimum targets are  not  met, then  no  shares will vest.
During fiscal year
2022,
we awarded
7  PSUs to key employees of Agena that are subject to both service and performance conditions. Based on actual performance through the period ended
December 31, 2022,
the awards are
not
expected to vest.
During fiscal year
2022,
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors granted a special long-term equity award consisting of PSUs covering a target of
40
shares that is subject to both performance and service conditions to our Chief Executive Officer. Based on actual performance through the period ended
December 31, 2022,
the award is estimated to vest at
93 %.
During the
three
months ended
December 31, 2022,
we adjusted our estimate of PSUs expected to vest under all outstanding plans based on actual results achieved through the performance period. We recorded a cumulative effect release of ($ 1,427 ) during the period ($ 1,127  net of tax as well as $ 0.21  per basic and diluted share for both the
three
and
nine
months ended
December 31, 2022),
which is recorded in general and administrative and selling expense on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In the future, we expect non-cash stock based compensation expense to decrease approximately $ 392  per quarter as a result of our new estimate of performance share units expected to vest.

Note
9 .   Earnings  (Loss) Per
Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share (“diluted EPS”) is computed similarly to basic earnings (loss) per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised. Potentially dilutive securities include stock options and both time and performance based RSUs (collectively “stock awards”), as well as common shares underlying the Notes. Stock awards are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS if they are subject to performance conditions that have
not
yet been achieved or are antidilutive. Diluted EPS considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities except in periods in which there is a loss because the inclusion of the potential common shares would then have an antidilutive effect.
The impact of the assumed conversion of the Notes calculated under the if-converted method was antidilutive, and as such, shares underlying the Notes were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation for the
three
and
nine  months ended
December 31, 2022  and
December 31, 2021 .
The following table presents a reconciliation of the denominators used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share:

Income Taxes
For interim income tax reporting, we estimate our annual effective tax rate and apply this effective tax rate to our year-to-date pre-tax income. Each quarter, our estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if the estimated effective tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made. Additionally, the tax effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring items are recognized as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. There is a potential for volatility in the effective tax rate due to several factors, including changes in the mix of the pre-tax income and the jurisdictions to which it relates, changes in tax laws and foreign tax holidays, settlement with taxing authorities, and foreign currency fluctuations.
Our effective income tax rate was
76.5 % and
384.8 % for the
three
and  nine  months ended
December 31, 2022 , respectively, compared to
12.0 % and ( 1.0 %) for the
three
and
nine
months ended
December 31, 2021.  The effective tax rate for both the
three
and
nine  months ended
December 31, 2022  differed from the statutory federal rate of
21 % primarily due to the share-based payment awards for employees and the effect of income generated in foreign jurisdictions.  The effective tax rate for the
three
and
nine
months ended
December 31, 2022
was higher than the comparable prior year periods primarily due to lower windfall benefits on stock option exercises and the vesting of restricted stock units and the effect of income in foreign jurisdictions.
Note
11 .
Commitments and
Contingencies
We review the adequacy of our legal reserves on a quarterly basis and establish reserves for loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. As of
December 31, 2022 , there were
no
material legal reserves recorded on the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As part of the Belyntic acquisition, we have agreed to pay an additional $ 1,500  to the sellers if contractually specified patents related to the technology purchased are issued. We believe that it is probable that the patents will be issued and we will pay the sellers in full within the next
36
months. The liability is recorded in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Overview
We are a multinational manufacturer, developer, and seller of life science tools and quality control products and services, many of which are sold into niche markets that are driven by regulatory requirements. We have manufacturing operations in the United States and Europe, and our products are marketed by our sales personnel in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, and by independent distributors in these areas as well as throughout the rest of the world. We prefer markets in which we can establish a strong presence and achieve high gross profit margins.
As of December 31, 2022, we managed our operations in four reportable segments, or divisions: Clinical Genomics, Sterilization and Disinfection Control, Biopharmaceutical Development, and Calibration Solutions. Each of our divisions are described further in "Results of Operations" below.

We strive to create shareholder value and further our purpose of Protecting the Vulnerable ®  by growing our business both organically and through acquisitions, by improving our operating efficiency, and by continuing to hire, develop and retain top talent. As a business, we commit to our purpose of Protecting the Vulnerable ®  every day by taking a customer-focused approach to developing, building, and delivering our products. We serve a broad set of industries, in particular the pharmaceutical, healthcare services, and medical device verticals, in which the safety, quality, and efficacy of products is critical.  By delivering the highest quality products possible, we are committed to protecting people, the environment, and end products.
Organic Revenues Growth
Organic revenues growth is driven by the expansion of our customer base, increases in sales volumes, new product offerings, and price increases, and may be affected positively or negatively by changes in foreign currency rates. Our ability to increase organic revenues is affected by general economic conditions, both domestic and international, customer capital spending trends, competition, and the introduction of new products. Our policy is to price our products competitively and, where possible, we pass along cost increases to our customers in order to maintain our margins. We typically evaluate costs and pricing annually with price increases effective January 1; however, as a result of high inflation in recent quarters, we implemented an additional mid-year price increase late in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023.

Inorganic Growth - Acquisitions
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, we completed the Belyntic acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of $6,450. The acquisition provided a natural complement to our peptide synthesis business by adding a consumables product line.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we completed the acquisition of Agena for an aggregate net purchase price of $300,793. Agena is a leading clinical genomics tools company that develops, manufactures, and sells highly sensitive, low-cost, high-throughput genetic analysis tools used by clinical labs to perform genomic clinical testing in several therapeutic areas, such as screenings for hereditary diseases, pharmacogenetics and oncology related applications. The acquisition of Agena accelerated our strategic trajectory towards higher growth applications within the regulated segments of the life sciences tools market.
Over the past decade, we have consummated a number of acquisitions as part of our growth strategy.  These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our product offerings, globalize our company, and increase the scale at which we operate, which in turn affords us the ability to improve our operating efficiency, extend our customer base, and further the pursuit of our purpose: Protecting the Vulnerable®.
Improving Our Operating Efficiency
We maximize value in both our existing businesses and those we acquire by implementing efficiencies in our manufacturing, commercial, engineering, and administrative operations. We achieve efficiencies using the four pillars that make up  The Mesa Way , which is our customer-centric, lean-based system for continuously improving and operating a set of high-margin, niche businesses.  The Mesa Way  is focused on: Measuring What Matters using our customers' perspective and setting high standards for performance; Empowering Teams to improve operationally and exceed customer expectations; Steadily Improving using lean-based tools designed to help us identify the root cause of opportunities and prioritize the biggest opportunities; and Always Learning so that performance continuously improves.
Gross profit is affected by many factors including our product mix, manufacturing efficiencies, costs of products and labor, foreign currency rates, and price competition. Historically, as we have integrated our acquisitions and taken advantage of manufacturing efficiencies, our gross profit percentages for some products have improved. There are, however, differences in gross profit percentages between product lines, and ultimately the mix of sales will continue to impact our overall gross profit.
Hire, Develop, and Retain Top Talent
At the center of our organization are talented people who are capable of taking on new challenges using a team approach. It is our exceptionally talented workforce that works together and uses our lean-based tool set to find ways to continuously improve our products, our services, and ourselves, resulting in long-term value creation for our shareholders.
General Trends
We are a global company, and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (“USD”). Exchanges rates have been volatile throughout our fiscal year 2023 and a weakening or strengthening of foreign currencies against the USD increases or decreases our revenues and gross profit margins as well as impacting the comparability of our results between periods. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Any further strengthening of the USD against major currencies would adversely impact our reported revenues, but would, to a lesser extent, positively impact our reported expenses for the remainder of the fiscal year; conversely, any weakening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies would positively impact our reported revenues but would negatively impact our expenses for the remainder of the fiscal year.
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, inflation impacting the cost of raw materials, labor, and freight, as a result of global macroeconomic trends, including government mandated actions in response to the Coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”) and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Our actions to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions and inflation, including pre-ordering components in higher than usual quantities, sourcing new vendors and increasing prices have been somewhat successful; however, raw materials shortages have at times impacted our Calibrations Solutions division, in particular.
We experienced disruptions to our business in China resulting from government mandated shut-downs and restrictions during our fiscal year 2023. Additionally, the Chinese government recently revoked many COVID-19 related restrictions and while these policy changes did not significantly impact our results of operations for our third fiscal quarter, it is possible that future quarters may be impacted. The impact of COVID-19 has negatively impacted commercial execution in different ways throughout fiscal year 2023, and in some cases, has limited sales of Clinical Genomics consumables to existing customers and instruments to new customers. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has largely subsided as a public health matter, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of the pandemic's adverse impact on the global economy, in-person collaboration and sales efforts, and our customers’ changed purchasing behaviors and confidence.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, we were notified by Sema4 Holdings Corp. ("Sema4"), a customer of our Clinical Genomics division, that they are exiting the reproductive health screening business and as a result, they intend to significantly reduce the quantity of orders they place with us in the future. Revenue from sales to Sema4 were approximately $8,200 during the first twelve months of our ownership of Agena. Following the notice, we evaluated our business operations and enacted several cost-cutting measures in the Clinical Genomics division, including a reduction-in-force, to preserve our financial model. These actions are expected to generate more than $4,000 in future annualized savings.

Results of Operations
Our results of operations and period-over-period changes are discussed in the following section. The tables and discussion below should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto appearing in Item 1.  Financial Statements
(in thousands, except percent data).
Revenues from our reportable segments decreased 1% and increased 30% for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year.  The decrease in revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was attributable to a 2.1% decline in organic revenues which resulted from both unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates and $1,500 of COVID-19 related revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Revenues growth for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Agena, and to a lesser extent, organic revenues growth of 3.5%.
Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased seven and two percentage points for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, primarily as a result of the recognition of a $6,062 non-cash inventory step-up charge, as part of purchase accounting for the Agena acquisition during the three months ended December 31, 2021.

Clinical Genomics revenues decreased 5% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the relevant prior year period, primarily as a result of a reduction in COVID-related revenues of $1,374 and adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by a longer period of ownership of Agena in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Clinical Genomics revenues increased 194% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the relevant prior year period due to a significantly shorter period of ownership of Agena for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The loss of Sema4 is expected to result in a significant reduction of anticipated revenues for this division in future quarters. However, our distribution partner Guangzhou Darui Biotechnology Co., Ltd. recently received China's National Medical Products Administration approval for a Class III in vitro diagnostics ("IVD") panel covering hereditary deafness. This is the first approved Class III IVD panel in China from our distribution partner program.
Gross profit percentage for the Clinical Genomics division increased 28% and 31% for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the relevant prior year periods due to the amortization of a $6,062 inventory step-up required by purchase accounting in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. We have taken actions to reduce our costs in this division which will help offset the loss of revenues from Sema4.
Sterilization and Disinfection Control
Our Sterilization and Disinfection Control division manufactures and sells biological, cleaning, and chemical indicators which are used to assess the effectiveness of sterilization and disinfection processes in the hospital, medical device, and pharmaceutical industries. The division also provides testing and laboratory services, mainly to the dental industry. Sterilization and disinfection control products are disposable and are used on a routine basis.

Sterilization and Disinfection Control revenues increased 18% and 12% for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the relevant prior year periods, despite the USD strengthening against the euro.  During the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2023, we added temporary and permanent manufacturing headcount at our Bozeman Montana facility, which enabled us to fulfill a higher volume of customer orders compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. The three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 also benefited from favorable product mix and to a lesser extent, price increases.
Sterilization and Disinfection Control's gross profit percentage decreased one and two percentage points for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the relevant prior year periods as a result of foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacting our reported revenues, increased labor and benefit costs, including the cost of temporary headcount, and increased freight costs.
Biopharmaceutical Development
Our Biopharmaceutical Development division develops, manufactures, and sells automated systems for protein analysis (immunoassays) and peptide synthesis solutions. Immunoassays and peptide synthesis solutions accelerate the discovery, development, and manufacture of biotherapeutic drugs.

Biopharmaceutical Development revenues decreased 9% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the relevant prior year period, primarily due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, the division faced a difficult compare versus the prior year, which reported an anomalous 46% revenues growth, partially offset by price increases. Biopharmaceutical Development revenues increased 8% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the relevant prior year period primarily due to increased product adoption and price increases, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Calibration Solutions revenues decreased 7% and 5% for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the relevant prior year periods, primarily as a result of supply constraints limiting our ability to manufacture ordered quantities of certain products. Production difficulties continue to result in longer lead times for customer orders, which have negatively impacted the timing of new orders; however, we anticipate that such difficulties will begin to abate in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023.
Calibration Solutions' gross profit percentage was essentially flat for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses decreased 6% and increased 41% for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the relevant prior year periods, primarily as a result of lower personnel costs and the Agena acquisition. Operating expenses were favorably impacted by the strengthening of the USD during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022.
Selling
Selling expense is driven primarily by labor costs, including salaries and commissions; accordingly, it may vary with sales levels.

Our effective income tax rate was 76.5% and 384.8% for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and 12.0% and (1.0%) for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 differed from the statutory federal rate of 21% primarily due to the share-based payment awards for employees and the effect of income generated in foreign jurisdictions. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was higher than the same period in fiscal year 2022 primarily due to the share-based compensation and the effect of income in foreign jurisdictions.
Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, and the geographic composition of our pre-tax income. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust our effective income tax rate accordingly.
Net Income (Loss)
Net income (loss) varies with changes in revenues, gross profit, and operating expenses (and included $21,573 and $9,859 of non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and stock-based compensation expense, respectively, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash available from our Credit Facility and the Open Market Sale Agreement SM , described below, working capital, and potential additional equity and debt offerings.  We believe that cash flows from operating activities and potential cash provided by borrowings from our Credit Facility or funds from our Open Market Sale Agreement SM , when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled interest payments on debt, dividend payments, and anticipated capital expenditures. We currently expect to settle the Notes in shares of our common stock, but we may re-finance the debt, depending on conditions in the market and the share price of our common stock.
Our more significant uses of resources have historically included acquisitions, payments of debt and interest obligations, long-term capital expenditures, and quarterly dividends to shareholders. Working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. We had working capital of $72,568 and $76,263 as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022, we had $26,101 and $49,346, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
As of December 31, 2022, $172,500 in aggregate principal Notes was outstanding and $19,000 was outstanding under the Credit Facility.
In April 2022, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement SM  pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of up to $150,000.
We routinely evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions. Future material acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital, assume additional third-party debt or incur other long-term obligations. We believe that we have the ability to issue more equity or debt in the future in order to finance our acquisition and investment activities; however, additional equity or debt financing, or other transactions, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
We may from time to time repurchase or take other steps to reduce our debt. These actions may include retirements or refinancing of outstanding debt, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The amount of debt that may be retired, if any, could be material and would be decided at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and would depend on market conditions, our cash position, and other considerations.

Dividends
We have paid regular quarterly dividends since 2003. We declared and paid dividends of $0.16 per share during each of the quarters ended June 30, 2022, September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2022, as well as each quarter of fiscal year 2022.
In January 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock, payable on March 15, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2023.
Cash Flows
Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities were as follows (in thousands):
Nine Months Ended December 31,

Net cash provided by operating activities
$

Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities
(28,936
)
62,623
Cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 provided $15,464. Net income and non-cash adjustments totaled $34,588 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $32,838 for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Adjustments to working capital accounts used $16,207 more cash in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower collections on trade receivables and higher spend on inventory as we built supplies to mitigate supply chain risk. Cash used in investing activities was lower for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021, due to the Agena acquisition during fiscal year 2022, partially offset by the Belyntic acquisition in fiscal year 2023. Cash used by financing activities primarily resulted from $30,000 repaid on our Credit Facility during the nine months ended December 31, 2022.
Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments
We are party to many contractual obligations that involve commitments to make payments to third parties in the ordinary course of business. For a description of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of March 31, 2022, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 31, 2022.
On a consolidated basis, as of December 31, 2022, we had contractual obligations for open purchase orders of approximately $19,441 for routine purchases of supplies and inventory, which are payable in less than one year. Open purchase orders have decreased, in part, due to our previously taken steps to mitigate risks in supply by increasing our stock of certain critical raw materials.
As part of the Belyntic acquisition, we have agreed to pay $1,500 to the sellers if contractually specified patents related to the  technology purchased are issued. We believe that it is probable that the patents will be issued and we will pay the sellers in full within the next 36 months. The liability is recorded in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. These estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgements are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.
Acquired Intangible Assets
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, in response to the loss of a significant customer, we used Level 3 inputs to test the recoverability of the Clinical Genomics division’s intangible asset group and evaluate the division’s goodwill response to the loss of a significant customer. After considering all information available to us as of the date of testing, we concluded that no impairment is indicated.
Fair values assigned to intangible assets acquired in the Belyntic acquisition were measured using Level 3 inputs.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
a bout Market Risk
Our reporting currency is U.S. dollars, and the functional currency of each of our material foreign subsidiaries is its respective local currency. Our operations include activities outside of the U.S. and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the U.S. dollar. We face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of various factors including intercompany currency denominated loans, selling our products in various currencies, purchasing raw materials and equipment in various currencies, and tax exposures not denominated in the functional currency. These exposures have increased as we have continued to expand internationally, including the acquisition of Gyros Protein Technologies Holding AB, which incurs a substantial portion of its business expenses in Swedish Krona, and the acquisition of Agena, which conducts a portion of its business in euros and a portion in Chinese Yuan Renminbi. Fluctuations in exchange rates have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We do not hedge exposure to exchange rates.
Our Credit Facility bears interest at either a base rate or a SOFR rate, plus an applicable spread. Based on the balance currently outstanding against our line of credit, if interest rates increased by 75 basis points, we would incur approximately $143 of additional interest expense per year.
We have no derivative instruments. We have minimal exposure to commodity market risks.

Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of December 31, 2022, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Agena Acquisition was completed on October 20, 2021, and the financial results of Agena are included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2022 and for the period then ended, and as of December 31, 2022 and for the nine months then ended. During the time since acquisition, we have assessed the control environment of Agena and made certain changes to Agena's internal controls over financial reporting, including design changes that were required as we brought Agena onto our enterprise resource planning tool. We now consider Agena to be included in the scope of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting.
