Table of Contents UNITED STATES BASKETBALL LEAGUE, INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOVEMBER 30, 2022 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS United States Basketball League, Inc. (“USBL”, ”the Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on May 29, 1984 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Meisenheimer Capital, Inc. (“MCI”) for the purpose of developing and managing a professional basketball league, the United States Basketball League (the “League”). Prior to the pending merger, USBL has primarily engaged in selling franchises and managing the League. From 1985 and up to the present time, USBL has sold a total of approximately forty active franchises (teams), a vast majority of which were terminated for non-payment of their respective franchise obligations. On April 7, 2021, through a series of Stock Purchase Agreements (the “Purchase Agreements”), the majority owners of the Company, Richard C. Meisenheimer, Daniel T. Meisenheimer, III, James Meisenheimer, Meisenheimer Capital, Inc. and Spectrum Associates, Inc. (the “Sellers”) sold
2,704,007
common shares which it held, to a new investor group. The Sellers also sold
1,105,644
of USBL’s preferred stock at a per share price of $ .057
per share to EROP Enterprises, LLC. As a result of the sale of common and preferred stock by the Sellers, the Company experienced a change in control. World Equity Markets acted in the capacity of a broker/dealer for the Purchase Agreements and was issued
125,000
shares of common stock for its services, and Verde Capital was issued
150,000
shares for Consulting Services. Effective April 7, 2021, the Board of Directors accepted the resignation of Daniel T. Meisenheimer, III as Chairman of the Board of Directors and President of the Company. Effective April 7, 2021, Saeb Jannoun was appointed to fill the vacancy following the resignation of Daniel T. Meisenheimer, III as Chairman of the Board of Directors and President of the Company. Mr. Michael Pruitt also joined the Board.
​ On November 23, 2022, USBL entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Shurepower, LLC d/b/a Shorepower Technologies, Inc. (“Shorepower”) under which Shorepower will be merged with and into USBL subject to several closing conditions, including satisfactory completion of due diligence reviews by each party to the Merger Agreement, Shorepower providing USBL with the most recent two years of audited financial statements by a PCAOB auditor, USBL authorizing a new class of Series B preferred stock with each Series B preferred share having the voting power of
40
shares of USBL common stock, USBL completing a stock and warrant financing to have a minimum of $ 480,000
in cash at closing (the “USBL Pre-Merger Financing”) and USBL not having any debt or contingent liabilities of any kind at the time of the closing. ​ The transaction is expected to close in January 2023. ​ Shorepower is a transportation electrification infrastructure manufacturer of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), Truck Stop Electrification (TSE) and electric standby Transport Refrigeration Unit (eTRU) station. They have
60
operational TSE facilities with over
1,800
individual electrified parking spaces in
31
states. Shorepower’s stations are EPA SmartWay-Verified and CARB-Verified. Shorepower is a New York limited liability company with headquarters in Hillsboro (Portland Area), Oregon and office in Detroit, Michigan metro area. Shorepower is a certified minority owned business enterprise (MBE). The Shorepower management team is comprised of a group of seasoned individuals with knowledge of technology, transportation and heavy-duty vehicles and nearly two decades working together. Combined, the team has managed over $ 16
million in government contracts and grant funds to deploy transportation electrification throughout the nation. ​ NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s latest Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would
9
Table of Contents substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year, as reported in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, have been omitted. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s accounting estimates include the collectability of receivables, useful lives of long-lived assets and recoverability of those assets, impairment in fair value of goodwill, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements The Company has implemented all new applicable accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. ​ NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $ 7,531,587 , and few sources of revenue. Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. ​ NOTE 4 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company granted
500,000
shares of common stock to EROP for services per the terms of a consulting agreement. The shares were valued at $ 0.27 , the closing stock price on the date of grant, for total non-cash expense of $ 135,000 . The expense is being amortized over the
three-month
term of the service agreement with EROP. As of November 30, 2022, the Company recognized $ 45,000
of the expense. ​ During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company granted
500,000
shares of common stock to Thirty-05, LLC, a company owned by Saeb Jannoun, for officer and director services. The shares were valued at $ 0.27 , the closing stock price on the date of grant, for total non-cash expense of $ 135,000 . ​ During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company granted
250,000
shares of common stock to Michael Pruitt for director services. The shares were valued at $ 0.27 , the closing stock price on the date of grant, for total non-cash expense of $ 67,500 . ​ NOTE 5 – COMMON STOCK During the three months ended November 30, 2022, the Company granted
250,000
shares of common stock to Millennial Investments, LLC for consulting services per the terms of a consulting agreement. The shares were valued at
$ 0.27 , the closing stock price on the date of grant, for total non-cash expense of
$ 135,000 . The expense is being amortized over the
three-month
term of the service agreement. As of November 30, 2022, the Company recognized
$ 22,500
of the expense. ​ 10
Table of Contents NOTE 6 – PREFERRED STOCK On May 18, 2021, the Company increased its authorized shares of Preferred Stock from
2,000,000
to
10,000,000
shares. There are
1,105,644

Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements.

We do not expect the adoption of any other pronouncements to have an impact on our results of operations or financial position. ​ ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
