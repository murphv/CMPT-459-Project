NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(dollars in thousands, except per share data)
(unaudited)
1.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form
10 -Q and Article
8
of Regulation S- X
and do
not
include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual report on Form
10 -K for the fiscal year ended
April 30, 2022 . In our opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the  three
and
nine
months ended
January 31, 2023
are
not
indicative of the results of operations that
may
be expected for the fiscal year ending
April 30, 2023 .
Certain reclassifications within the condensed financial statement captions have been made to maintain consistency in presentation between years. These reclassifications have
no
impact on the reported results of operations. Financial amounts are in thousands of dollars except per share amounts.
2.
Net Income Per Share: Butler National Corporation (“the Company”) follows ASC
260
that requires the reporting of both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. In accordance with ASC
260,
any anti-dilutive effects on net earnings per share would be excluded.
3.
Revenue Recognition: ASC Topic
606,
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers”
Under ASC
606,
revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services. To achieve this core principal, the Company applies the following
five
steps:
1 )
Identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer
A contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party’s rights regarding the services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these services, (ii) the contract has commercial substance and (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration.
2 )
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract
At contract inception, an entity shall assess the goods or services promised in a contract with a customer and shall identify as a performance obligation each promise to transfer to the customer. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from
third
parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised services, the Company must apply judgment to determine whether promised services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are
not
met the promised services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.
3 )
Determination of the transaction price
The transaction price is the amount that an entity allocates to the performance obligations identified in the contract and, therefore, represents the amount of revenue recognized as those performance obligations are satisfied. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer.
4 )
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
Once a contract and associated performance obligations have been identified and the transaction price has been determined, ASC
606
requires an entity to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified. This is generally done in proportion to the standalone selling prices of each performance obligation (i.e., on a relative standalone selling price basis). As a result, any discount within the contract generally is allocated proportionally to all of the separate performance obligations in the contract. The Company is applying the right to invoice practical expedient to recognize revenue. As a result, the entity bypasses the steps of determining the transaction price, allocating that transaction price and determining when to recognize revenue as it will recognize revenue as billed by multiplying the price assigned to the good or service, by the units.

Table of Contents
5 )
Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation
Revenue is recognized when or as performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. Control transfers either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.
Aircraft modifications are performed under fixed-price contracts. Revenue from fixed-priced contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the direct labor incurred compared to total estimated direct labor.
Revenue from Avionics products are recognized when shipped. Payment for these Avionics products is due within
30
days of the invoice date after shipment. Revenue from Gaming Management and other Corporate/Professional Services is recognized as the service is rendered.
Regarding warranties and returns, our products are special order and are
not
suitable for return. Our products are unique upon installation and tested prior to their release to the customer and acceptance by the customer. In the rare event of a warranty claim, the claim is processed through the normal course of business and
may
include additional charges to the customer. In our opinion, any future warranty work would
not
be material to the consolidated financial statements.
Gaming revenue is the gross gaming win as reported by the Kansas Lottery casino reporting systems, less the mandated payments by and for the State of Kansas. Electronic games-slots and table games revenue is the aggregate of gaming wins and losses. Liabilities are recognized for chips and "ticket-in, ticket-out" coupons in the customers' possession, and for accruals related to anticipated payout of progressive jackpots. Progressive gaming machines, which contain base jackpots that increase at a progressive rate based on the number of coins played, are deducted from revenue as the value of jackpots increase. Effective
September 1, 2022,
sports wagering became legal in the State of Kansas. The Company is currently managing sports wagering through DraftKings sports wagering platform. The Company shares a percentage of the gross sports wagering win with its platform partner. Food, beverage, and other revenue is recorded when the service is received and paid.

$ 4,754     $ 3,636
Contract Asset
2,722       1,470

4,863       820
Accounts receivable, net consist of $ 4,754  and $ 3,636  from customers as of
January 31, 2023  and

January 31, 2023
and
April 30, 2022 . Contract assets increased $ 1,252

6.
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences
may
be material to our consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates include assumptions about percentage-of-completion, collection of accounts receivable, the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation expense, valuation for deferred tax assets and useful life of fixed assets.
7.  Inventories: Inventories are determined on a
first -in,
first -out basis, valued at lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories include material, labor and factory overhead required in the production of our products.
Inventory obsolescence is examined on a regular basis. When determining our estimate of obsolescence, we consider inventory that has been inactive for
five
years or longer and the probability of using that inventory in future production. The obsolete inventory generally consists of Falcon and Learjet parts and electrical components.  At
January 31, 2023
and
April 30, 2022 , the estimate of obsolete inventory was $ 240  and $ 240  respectively.
8.
Research and Development: We invested in research and development activities. The amount invested in the  nine  months ended
January 31, 2023  and

COVID-
19
Overview:
The pandemic caused by COVID- 19
has caused volatility in world-wide financial markets since
2020,
primarily due to uncertainty with respect to the severity and duration of the pandemic. Although many experts believe the pandemic has ended in
2022,
the threat of outbreaks and new variations of the virus continue to affect operations and finances of businesses like ours.
We have experienced lower customer headcount, which has been off-set by a larger net revenue per customer. We are experiencing, and expect to continue experiencing, lower demand for our professional services and increased costs and other challenges related to COVID- 19
that adversely affects our business.
The COVID- 19
pandemic has impacted our business operations and financial results and continues to impact us in fiscal
2023.  We face numerous uncertainties in estimating the direct and indirect effects on our present and future business operations, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Due to several rapidly changing variables related to the COVID- 19
pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate future economic trends and the timing of when stability will return. Refer to Item
1A.
“Risk Factors” in Form
10 -K for the fiscal year ended
April
30,2022
for a disclosure of risk factors related to COVID- 19.
As the economy in general slowly recovers, and vaccination rates in our operating territory improve and new infections decline, we have continued to see improvements in customer headcount. However, the unpredictable nature of the pandemic could again lead to closures, decreased traffic and demand, and increased COVID- 19 - related operating expenses, for the foreseeable future. While COVID- 19
has resulted in, and will continue to bring, significant challenges and uncertainty to our operating environment, we believe that our resilient business model and the strength of our brand and balance sheet position us well to emerge from the pandemic.
17.  Extension of the Shareholder Rights Plan:
On
July 22, 2021,
the Company extended the shareholder rights plan between the Company and UMB Bank, N.A. as rights agent dated as of
August 2, 2011 ( the “Rights Plan”). The Rights Plan is intended to protect the interests of the Company’s stockholders and enable them to realize the full potential value of their investment by reducing the likelihood that any person or group gains control of the Company, through open market accumulation or other tactics, without appropriately compensating all stockholders. Pursuant to the Rights Plan, the Company issued, by means of a dividend,
one
preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of our Common Stock to shareholders of record on the close of business on
August 2, 2011.
Shares issued after
August 2, 2011
also include
one
Right. Until a triggering event, these Rights will trade with, and be represented by, the shares of our Common Stock. The Rights will generally become exercisable only if any person (or any persons acting as a group) acquires
15 % or more of our outstanding Common Stock (the “Acquiring Person”) in a transaction

COVID-19 Overview
The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has caused volatility in world-wide financial markets since 2020, primarily due to uncertainty with respect to the severity and duration of the pandemic. Although many experts believe the pandemic has ended in 2022, the threat of outbreaks and new variations of the virus continue to affect operations and finances of businesses like ours.
We have experienced lower customer headcount, which has been off-set by a larger net revenue per customer. We are experiencing, and expect to continue experiencing, lower demand for our professional services and increased costs and other challenges related to COVID-19 that adversely affects our business.
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business operations and financial results and continues to impact us in fiscal 2023. We face numerous uncertainties in estimating the direct and indirect effects on our present and future business operations, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Due to several rapidly changing variables related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate future economic trends and the timing of when stability will return. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022 for a disclosure of risk factors related to COVID-19.
As the economy in general slowly recovers, and vaccinations rates in our operating territory improve and new infections decline, we have continued to see improvements in customer headcount. However, the unpredictable nature of the pandemic could again lead to closures, decreased traffic and demand, and increased COVID-19- related operating expenses, for the foreseeable future. While COVID-19 has resulted in, and will continue to bring, significant challenges and uncertainty to our operating environment, we believe that our resilient business model and the strength of our brand and balance sheet position us well to emerge from the pandemic.

Revenue  increased 16% to $20.5 million in the three months ended January 31, 2023, compared to $17.6 million in the three months ended January 31, 2022. See "Operations by Segment" below for a discussion of the primary reasons for the decrease in revenue.
●
Professional Services derives its revenue from (a) professional management services in the gaming industry through Butler National Service Corporation ("BNSC") and BHCMC, LLC ("BHCMC"), and (b) professional architectural, engineering and management support services. Revenue from Professional Services increased 8% for the three months to $9.6 million at January 31, 2023 compared to $8.9 million at January 31, 2022.  The increase is due to sports book revenue of $1.2 million and a decrease in casino gaming revenue of $0.5 million.
●
Aerospace Products derives its revenue by designing, engineering, manufacturing, installing, servicing and repairing products for classic and current production aircraft. Aerospace Products revenue increased 25% for the three months to $10.9 million at January 31, 2023 compared to $8.7 million at January 31, 2022.  The increase in revenue is primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in aircraft modification business and a $200 increase in special mission electronics.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe that our current banks will provide the necessary capital for our business operations. However, we continue to maintain contact with other banks that have an interest in funding our working capital needs to continue our growth in operations in fiscal 2023 and beyond. Please see footnote 9 to the Company's financial statements regarding "Debt" for additional details concerning our liquidity and capital resources.
Analysis and Discussion of Cash Flow
During the nine months ended January 31, 2023 our cash position increased by $4.7 million. Net income was $5.1 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023. Cash flows provided by operating activities was $13.0 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023. Non-cash activities consisting of depreciation and amortization provided $4.3 million, while deferred compensation provided $229, gain on the sale of a building used $69, deferred income tax expense provided $280, and stock awarded to director provided $352. Contract assets decreased our cash position by $1.3. Contract liability increased our cash position by $4.0 million. Inventories decreased our cash position by $503. Accounts receivable decreased our cash position by $1,118. Gaming facility mandated payments decreased our cash position by $257. Prepaid expenses and other assets decreased our cash by $2.5 million. An increase in accounts payable, an increase in accrued liabilities and lease liabilities, and an increase in other current liabilities increased our cash by $5.4  million.  Income tax payable decreased our cash position by $933.
Cash used in investing activities was $4.1 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023. We invested $1.5 million towards STCs, and $2.0 million on equipment and furnishings, $79 on airplane upgrades, and $534 on the construction of new hangers. We received $164 in proceeds from the sale of a building.
Cash used by financing activities was $4.2 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023. We made repayments on our debt of $3.9 million. We made repayments on lease right-to-use of $194. We purchased company stock of $60. The stock acquired was placed in treasury.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving management judgments and estimates. These significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, the use of estimates, long-lived assets, and Supplemental Type Certificates. These policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Revenue Recognition:
See footnote 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Lease Right-to-Use:  The Company accounts for Lease Right-to-use in accordance with ASU 2016-02 "Leases".  ASU 2016-02 requires that on the balance sheet, a lease should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing the Company's right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.  Estimates are used to determine the useful life, impairment if any, and the discount rate.  The useful life was determined based on the lease term, there is no impairment at this time and the discount rate used to calculate the lease liability was the Company's incremental borrowing rate.  See footnote 13 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding specific lease calculations.
Use of Estimates:
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. Significant estimates include assumptions about percentage-of-completion, collection of accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence, the valuation of long-lived assets, including the STC’s, valuation for deferred tax assets and useful life of fixed and other long-term assets.
Long-lived Assets:
The Company accounts for its long-lived assets in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." ASC Topic 360-10 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset's carrying value and fair value or disposable value.
Supplemental Type Certificates:
Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) are authorizations granted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for specific modification of a certain aircraft. The STC authorizes us to perform modifications, installations, and assemblies on applicable customer-owned aircraft. Costs incurred to obtain STCs are capitalized and subsequently amortized over a seven year life. The legal life of an STC is indefinite.
Changing Prices and Inflation
We have experienced upward pressure from inflation in fiscal year 2023. From fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023 most of the increases we experienced were in material and labor costs. This additional cost may not be transferable to our customers resulting in lower income in the future. We anticipate fuel costs and possibly interest rates to rise in fiscal 2023 and 2024.

Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information required under this item.
Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Our principal executive and financial officers have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q and have determined that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective, based on criteria in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures:
Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the Exchange Act are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
In connection with the preparation of this Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2023.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Limitations on Controls
Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:
In our opinion there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
