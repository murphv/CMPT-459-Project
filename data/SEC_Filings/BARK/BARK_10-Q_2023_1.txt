These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “may,” “will,” “potential,” “projects,” “predicts,” “continue,” or “should,” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. There can be no assurance that actual results will not materially differ from expectations. Such statements include, but are not limited to, any statements relating to our financial and business performance, the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents for our continued operations, market acceptance and the anticipated success of our business model, and our ability to expand the scope of our offerings. These statements are based on management's current expectations, but actual results may differ materially due to various factors. The forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. Future developments affecting us may not be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under Part II, Item 1A: “Risk Factors.” Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. These risks and others described under Part II, Item 1A: “Risk Factors” may not be exhaustive. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments in the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. In addition, even if our results or operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments in the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BARK, Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation formerly known as The Original BARK Company and, prior to the Merger (as defined below in Note 3),
Northern Star Acquisition Corp. ("Northern Star") , is an omnichannel brand serving dogs across the
four
key categories of Play, Food, Health and Home. The Company is located and headquartered in New York, New York.
Following the closing of the business combination discussed in Note 3 below, the Company changed its name to “The Original BARK Company,” and in November 2021 changed its name to BARK, Inc. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation — The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BARK, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the accounting disclosure rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Therefore, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on May 31, 2022.
The consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022, included herein, was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date, but does not include all disclosures, including certain notes required by U.S. GAAP, required on an annual reporting basis.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods. The results for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter, the year ending March 31, 2023, or any other period. There have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies as described in the audited consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2022 and 2021. Although the Company has incurred recurring losses in each year since inception, the Company expects its cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months. Use of Estimates— The Company makes estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates, judgments and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. The most significant estimates relate to determination of fair value of the Company’s allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, allowance for inventory obsolescence, stock-based compensation, fair value of
7 right-of-use assets
and the valuation of embedded derivatives. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and records adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from those estimates. Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic —The Company continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence and spread of variants of COVID-19 on the U.S. and global economies and on the Company’s operating results, financial condition and cash flows. The estimates of the impact COVID-19 may have on the Company’s business may change based on new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. The Company has not incurred any significant impairment losses in the carrying values of its assets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and is not aware of any specific related event or circumstance that could require the Company to revise the estimates reflected in its condensed consolidated financial statements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments —The Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, are carried at historical cost. At December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximated their fair values because of their short-term nature. The carrying amounts of the Company’s long-term debt approximate the fair value based on consideration of current borrowing rates available to the Company. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the condensed consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows: Level 1 —Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date; Level 2 —Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and Level 3 —Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data for the related assets or liabilities. 8 The categorization of a financial instrument within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following summarizes assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level, within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands): As of December 31, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Money market funds (1) $ 55,077   $ —   $ —   $ 55,077   $ 55,077   $ —   $ —   $ 55,077   Liabilities Public warrant liability (2) $ 1,272   $ —   $ —   $ 1,272   Private warrant liability (2) —   684   —   684   $ 1,272   $ 684   $ —   $ 1,956   As of March 31, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Liabilities Public warrant liability (2) $ 5,516   $ —   $ —   $ 5,516   Private warrant liability (2) —   2,963   —   2,963   $ 5,516   $ 2,963   $ —   $ 8,479   ______________ (1) As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash equivalents held in a money market account. The Company has concluded that due to the highly liquid nature of the money market account, the carrying value approximates fair value, which represents a Level 1 input. The balance of cash equivalents held in the money market account is included in cash and cash equivalents.
(2) Included in accrued and other current liabilities. The Company’s warrants include publicly-traded warrants (the “Public Warrants”) which were issued as one-third of a warrant per unit issued during the Company’s initial public offering on November 10, 2020 (the “IPO”), warrants sold in a private placement to Northern Star’s sponsor (the “Private Warrants”), and preferred share warrants issued by Legacy BARK which were assumed by the Company in connection with the Merger and exchanged into warrants for BARK common stock (the “Common Stock Warrants”). All of the Common Stock Warrants have been exercised and are
no
longer outstanding.
The Company evaluated its warrants under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity, and concluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders’ equity. Since the Public Warrants and Private Warrants meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815, the warrants have been recorded as current liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value upon issuance, with subsequent changes in their respective fair values recognized in other income, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) at each reporting date. See further disclosure on the change in fair value of Public and Private Warrant liabilities within Note 10, “Other Income (Expense) - Net.” Restricted Cash —The Company has restricted cash to secure a letter of credit for
two
of its leases, restricted cash is expected to be maintained as a security deposit for the duration of each respective lease.
As of
both December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company has classified $ 2.3
million within other noncurrent assets, as restricted cash.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Major Customers and Suppliers —Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts
9 receivable. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with one domestic financial institution of high credit quality.
The Company’s accounts receivable are derived from sales contracts with large retail customers. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on customer accounts when deemed necessary. Significant customers are those that represent more than 10% of the Company’s total revenues or gross accounts receivable balance at each balance sheet date. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any customers that accounted for 10% or more of total revenues. The Company had two customers that accounted for
59 % of gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The Company’s accounts receivable relates to sales to customers within the Commerce segment, which represented
10.6 % and
13.0 % of total revenue for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and
16.1 % and
12.7 % of total revenue for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Significant suppliers are those that represent more than 10% of the Company’s total finished goods purchased or accounts payable at each balance sheet date. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had two suppliers that accounted for
30 % of total finished goods purchased and two suppliers that accounted for
26 % of total finished goods purchased, respectively. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had two suppliers that accounted for
30 % of total finished goods purchased and two suppliers that accounted for
29 % of total finished goods purchased, respectively. The Company had
two suppliers that accounted for
49 % of the accounts payable balance and two suppliers that accounted for
26 % of the accounts payable balance as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update
(“ASU”) No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This update amends and simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions in existing guidance related to performing intraperiod tax allocation, calculating interim period taxes, and recognizing deferred taxes for investments. The update also provides new guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas. The Company adopted this guidance on April 1, 2022. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current guidance. ASU 2020-06 also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. ASU 2020-06 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, with early adoption permitted.
The Company adopted this guidance on April 1, 2022. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. 3. MERGER On June 1, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), Northern Star completed the acquisition of Barkbox, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Legacy BARK” and the acquisition, the “Merger”), pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), dated December 16, 2020, by and among Northern Star, NSAC Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Northern Star (“Merger Sub”), and Legacy Bark.
Immediately upon the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (collectively, the “Transactions” and the consummation of the Transactions, the “Closing”), Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy BARK, with Legacy BARK surviving the Business Combination as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the Transactions, the Company changed its name to “The Original BARK Company,” and in November 2021 changed its name to BARK, Inc. 10 The Merger is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP primarily
due to the fact that Legacy BARK stockholders continue to control the Company post the closing of the Merger.
Under this method of accounting, Northern Star is treated as the “acquired” company for accounting purposes and the Merger is treated as the equivalent of Legacy BARK issuing stock for the net assets of Northern Star, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Northern Star are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded.
Reported shares and earnings per share available to holders of the Company’s common stock and equity awards prior to the Business Combination have been retroactively restated reflecting the exchange ratio established pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement (1: 8.7425 ). Treasury stock has also been retrospectively restated to reflect the cancellation and extinguishment of the shares pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement.
Pursuant to the Merger, on the Closing Date, each stockholder of Legacy BARK’s common and preferred stock, (including stockholders issued common stock as a result of the conversion of Legacy BARK’s outstanding convertible promissory notes issued in 2019 and 2020 (other than the 2025 Convertible Notes - see Note 5, “Debt”)) received
8.7425
shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $ 0.0001
per share, per share of Legacy BARK’s common stock and preferred stock, respectively, owned by such Legacy BARK stockholder that was outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, (1) options to purchase shares of Legacy BARK’s common stock were converted into options to purchase an aggregate of
29,257,576
shares of the Company's common stock and (2) warrants to purchase shares of Legacy BARK’s common and redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted into warrants to purchase an aggregate of
1,897,212
shares of the Company's common stock.
Additionally, at the Closing: • the conversion obligations with respect to Legacy BARK’s
5.50 % convertible senior secured notes due 2025 (the “2025 Convertible Notes”) were assumed by the Company and the 2025 Convertible Notes became convertible at the election of the holders into shares of the Company's common stock. As of the Closing, the 2025 Convertible Notes were convertible at the election of the holder into an aggregate of
7,713,121
shares of the Company's common stock based on the then outstanding principal and accrued interest. The 2025 Convertible Notes are still outstanding as of December 31, 2022; • certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”) purchased an aggregate of
20,000,000
shares of the Company's common stock in a private placement at a price of $ 10.00
per share for an aggregate purchase price of $ 200.0
million (the “PIPE Issuance”); • each of the
6,358,750
outstanding shares of Northern Star’s Class B common stock were converted into a share of the Company's common stock on a one-for-one basis. Each outstanding warrant of Northern Star entitles the holder to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $ 11.50
per share beginning on November 13, 2021; and • the Company amended and restated its amended and restated certificate of incorporation, increasing the number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue to
500,000,000
shares. 4. REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS The Company generates revenue through its Direct to Consumer segment which consists of product sales of
monthly subscription boxes, as well as sales through its website, BarkShop.com, and its Commerce segment which generates revenue from product sales to retailers and through marketplaces. The Company’s standard payment terms vary but do not result in a significant delay between the timing of invoice and payment. The Company occasionally negotiates other payment terms during the contracting process for its retail business. The Company has elected the practical expedient to not adjust the total consideration within a contract to reflect a financing component when the duration of the financing is one year or less.
11 Disaggregated Revenue Revenue disaggregated by significant revenue stream for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenue Direct to Consumer: Toys and treats subscription $ 114,673   $ 114,270   $ 342,076   $ 321,343   Other 5,402   3,854   13,942   8,973   Total Direct to Consumer $ 120,075   $ 118,124   $ 356,018   $ 330,316   Commerce 14,259   22,688   53,280   48,264   Revenue $ 134,334   $ 140,812   $ 409,298   $ 378,580   Contract Liability The Company’s contract liability represents cash collections from its customers prior to delivery of subscription products, which is recorded as deferred revenue on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue upon the delivery of the box or product. Deferred revenue was $ 32.9
million and $ 31.5
million as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Performance Obligations A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account. Performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time when control of promised goods are transferred to customers. The Company has elected to not disclose information related to remaining performance obligations due to their original expected terms being one year or less.
5. DEBT As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, long-term debt consisted of the following (in thousands): As of December 31, As of March 31, 2022 2022 2025 Convertible Notes $ 83,525   $ 79,171   Less: deferred financing fees and debt discount ( 2,488 ) ( 2,981 ) Total long-term debt $ 81,037   $ 76,190   2025 Convertible Notes On November 27, 2020, the Company issued $ 75.0
million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes (the “2025 Convertible Notes”) to Magnetar Capital, LLC (“Magnetar”) under an indenture, dated as of November 27, 2020, between Legacy BARK and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and collateral agent (the “Indenture”). The Company received net proceeds of approximately $ 74.7
million from the sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes, after deducting fees and expenses of approximately $ 0.3
million. The Company recorded the expenses as a discount to the note and will amortize the expenses over the term of the note. The 2025 Convertible Notes will mature on December 1, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. 12 The Company used approximately $ 27.6
million of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes to repay the previously outstanding term loans with Western Alliance Bank and Pinnacle, which included $ 2.0
million of early repayment fees related to the Pinnacle loan.
The 2025 Convertible Notes are governed by the Indenture. The 2025 Convertible Notes bear interest at the annual rate of
5.50 %, payable entirely in payment-in-kind annually on December 1 st
of each year commencing December 1, 2021, compounded annually. The accrued interest of
$ 4.4
million and $ 4.2
million was paid-in-kind through an increase of the outstanding principal on the 2025 Convertible Notes on December 1, 2022 and 2021, respectively. If the 2025 Convertible Notes are not converted into common stock by the maturity date, the Company must repay the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest.
The 2025 Convertible Notes contain call and put options to be settled in cash contingent upon the occurrence of a change of control and a default interest rate increase of
3.0 % applicable upon the occurrence of an event of default that when evaluated under the guidance of ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging , are embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation at fair value. The fair value calculation includes Level 3 inputs including the estimated fair value of the Company’s common stock and assumptions regarding the probability that the contingent call or put will be exercised or an event of default will occur. Management determined that the probability that the contingent events will occur was near zero at inception and has remained near zero as of December 31, 2022. Therefore, the Company did not record a derivative liability related to these features as of December 31, 2022. The Company will assess the probability of occurrence quarterly during the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company had $ 83.5
million and $ 79.2
million, respectively, of outstanding borrowings under the note purchase agreement governing the purchase and sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes agreement. Western Alliance Bank—Line of Credit and Term Loan In October 2017, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Western Alliance Agreement”) and issued a warrant to purchase preferred stock (“Initial Western Alliance Warrant”) to Western Alliance Bank (“Western Alliance”), which provided for a secured revolving line of credit (the “Credit Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 35.0  million with a maturity date of October 12, 2020. On December 7, 2018, the Company amended the Western Alliance Agreement, which included the issuance of a warrant to purchase common stock (“Subsequent Western Alliance Warrant”) to Western Alliance. The modification to the Western Alliance Agreement provided for an additional term loan of $ 10.0
million at issuance and an incremental seasonal loan of $ 5.0
million. The seasonal loan matured and was repaid on March 31, 2020. The term loan had a maturity date of December 31, 2021.
On July 31, 2020, the Company amended the Western Alliance Agreement and extended the expiration of the warrants to July 31, 2030. The modification to the Western Alliance Agreement amended the maturity date of the Credit Facility to August 12, 2021.
On November 27, 2020, the Company repaid the outstanding $ 10.0
million principal of the term loan with Western Alliance Bank, as well as $ 0.2
million of early repayment fees, using proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes. See further discussion of the 2025 Convertible Notes issuance above.
In conjunction with the 2025 Convertible Notes issuance, the Company amended the Western Alliance Agreement to extend the Credit Facility repayment date from August 12, 2021 to December 31, 2021. On January 22, 2021, the Company amended the Western Alliance Agreement to extend the Credit Facility maturity date to May 31, 2022. On October 29, 2021, the Company and Western Alliance entered into the eleventh loan and security modification agreement, which increased the sublimit for foreign exchange services and export, import, and standby letters of credit under the Company’s existing loan and security agreement with Western Alliance
to $ 2.7
million. 13 On May 27, 2022, the Company and Western Alliance entered into the twelfth loan and security modification agreement, which extended the Credit Facility maturity date to June 30, 2022. On June 30, 2022, the Company and Western Alliance entered into the thirteenth loan and security modification agreement, which extended the Credit Facility maturity date to July 15, 2022. On August 3, 2022, the Company and Western Alliance entered into the fourteenth loan and security modification agreement, which extended the Credit Facility maturity date to May 31, 2023. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility, as amended, is equal to (i) the greater of the prime rate that is published in the Money Rates section of The Wall Street Journal from time to time (the “Prime Rate”)
and five and one quarter percent
5.25 %, plus (ii) half of one percent ( 0.50 %), per annum. The Credit Facility has a borrowing base subject to an amount equal to eighty percent ( 80.00 %) of the Company’s trailing three months of subscription revenue and an amount equal to ( 80.00 %) of certain of the Company’s customer accounts receivable when a collateral audit is performed and sixty percent ( 60.00 %) when no such collateral audit is performed. Western Alliance has first perfected security in substantially all of the Company’s assets, including its rights to its intellectual property.
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, there were
no
outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. The full amount of the Credit Facility of $ 35.0
million is available to be borrowed by the Company if or when needed through the termination date of the agreement of May 31, 2023. Under the terms of this Credit Facility, the Company is required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including covenants to maintain certain liquidity amounts, as defined in the amended Western Alliance Agreement. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company was compliant with its financial covenants. 6.     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS Equity Incentive Plans The Barkbox, Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended from time to time, the “2011 Plan”) provides for the award of stock options and other equity interests in the Company to directors, officers, employees, advisors or consultants of the Company.
On June 1, 2021, in connection with the Merger, the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) became effective and
16,929,505
authorized shares of common stock were reserved for issuance thereunder. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on the Closing Date of the Merger, options to purchase shares of Legacy BARK’s common stock previously issued under the 2011 Plan were converted into options to purchase an aggregate of
29,390,344
shares of BARK common stock. As of
December 31, 2022,
12,039,811
shares of common stock were available for the Company to grant under the 2021 Stock Plan; there were
no
more shares available for grant under the 2011 Plan. Beginning on April 1, 2022 and ending on (and including) March 31, 2031, the aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2021 Plan shall increase by a number, determined by the Company's Board of Directors on or before May 1st of such fiscal year, not to exceed
5 % of the total number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the last day of the preceding fiscal year.
The 2011 and 2021 Plans (together, the “Plans”) are administered by the Company’s Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”). The exercise prices, vesting and other restrictions are determined by the Board of Directors (the “Board”), except that the exercise price per share of a stock option may not be less than
100 % of the fair value of the common share on the date of grant. Stock options awarded under the Plans typically expire
10
years after the date of the grant and generally have vesting conditions of
25 % on the first anniversary of the date of grant and
75 % on a monthly basis at a rate of 1/36th unless otherwise determined by the
14 Compensation Committee. Restricted stock units (“RSU”) awarded under the plan for the purchase of common stock will vest based on continued service which is generally
four years . The grant date fair value of the award will be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of the RSUs is estimated on the date of grant based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock. The Plans provide that the Compensation Committee shall determine the vesting conditions of awards granted under the Plans, and the Compensation Committee has from time to time approved vesting schedules for certain awards that deviate from the vesting conditions described in the previous sentence. Employee Stock Purchase Plan In June 2021, the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2021 ESPP”) became effective. The 2021 ESPP authorizes the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to employees. A total of
3,385,901
shares of common stock have been reserved for future issuance under the 2021 ESPP. On the first day of each fiscal year commencing on April 1, 2022 and ending on (and including) March 31, 2041, the aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the ESPP shall increase by a number, determined by the Company's board of directors on or before May 1st of such fiscal year, not to exceed the lesser of (i) one percent ( 1 %) of the total number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the last day of the preceding fiscal year or (ii)
1,500,000
shares of common stock. If the Board of Directors does not determine to increase the aggregate number of shares of common stock in the ESPP by May 1st of such fiscal year, such increase shall be zero.
Employees who elect to participate in the ESPP commence payroll withholdings that accumulate through the end of the respective offering period. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 718-50 - Compensation - Stock Compensation, the ability to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock for eighty-five percent ( 85 %) of the lower of the price on the first day of the offering period or the last day of the offering period (i.e. the purchase date) represents an option and, therefore, the ESPP is a compensatory plan under this guidance. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense is determined based on the option’s grant-date fair value as estimated by applying the Black Scholes option-pricing model and is recognized over the withholding period.
During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, employees who elected to participate in the ESPP purchased a total of
109,186
shares of common stock, resulting in cash proceeds to the Company of approximately $ 0.1
million. ESPP employee payroll contributions accrued as of December 31, 2022 were less than $ 0.1
million, and are included within accrued and other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Cash withheld via employee payroll deductions is presented in financing activities as proceeds from stock purchases under employee stock purchase plan on the consolidated statement of cash flows. Stock Option Activity During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 the Company granted to its employees equity awards to purchase an aggregate of
1,575,074
shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $ 2.94
vesting over a
four-year
period. Restricted Stock Unit (“RSU”) Activity
During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 the Company granted to its employees RSUs for the purchase of
7,428,120
shares of common stock.
Market-based Award On April 15, 2022, pursuant to the 2021 Plan, the Company granted its CEO a market condition performance option award for the purchase of up to
600,000
shares of the Company’s common stock. The award had a grant date fair value of approximately $ 0.7
million using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Options under this market-based award will vest based on achievement of stock price targets of the Company's common stock. The right to purchase
200,000
shares of common stock under the options vests when the stock price meets or exceeds $ 8.00
per share for
30
consecutive days, the right to purchase
200,000
shares of common stock under the options vest when the stock price meets or exceeds $ 12.00
per share for
30
consecutive days, and the right to purchase
200,000
shares of
15 common stock under the options vests when the stock price meets or exceeds $ 16.00
per share for
30
consecutive days. These market-based conditions must be met in order for this option award to vest, and it is therefore possible that no awards would ultimately vest. The Company will recognize compensation expense for this award regardless of whether such conditions are met. The fair value is expensed over the requisite service period.
Stock-based Compensation The following table summarizes the total stock-based compensation expense by function for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, which includes expense related to options and RSUs (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 General and administrative $ 3,354   $ 2,200   $ 10,937   $ 4,599   Advertising and marketing 327   2,009   939   6,437   Total stock-based compensation expense $ 3,681   $ 4,209   $ 11,876   $ 11,036   7.     LEASES The Company has operating leases for its offices and fulfillment centers. Fulfillment and customer service centers and corporate office leases expire at various dates through 2038, excluding renewal options.
On October 29, 2021, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a new office space in New York, New York to serve as the Company’s new headquarters. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023 the Company completed the move to the new headquarters. In accordance with ASC 842,
Leases , the lease was classified as an operating lease. The new lease requires total lease payments of $ 39.8
million with a lease term of
16.5
years, excluding renewal options.
Rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease payments commence starting October 1, 2023, however, the Company took initial possession of the new headquarters on April 1, 2022 to begin constructing leasehold improvements, which resulted in an initial recording of a right-of-use asset of $ 17.0
million, other current asset of $ 7.6
million and corresponding operating lease liability of $ 24.6
million, and commencement of operating lease expense. The Company has the right to sublease all, or a portion, of this leased office space provided that certain terms and conditions are met. The Company also leases certain equipment under operating and finance leases. The terms of equipment leases are generally
five years
and do not contain renewal options. These finance leases expire at various dates through 2026. The Company’s finance leases as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 were not material and were included in property and equipment, net, on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. 16 The following schedule represents the components of the Company’s operating lease assets (in thousands): As of As of Leases Classification December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Assets Operating Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 37,601   $ 29,552   Total operating lease assets $ 37,601   $ 29,552   Liabilities Operating lease liabilities (current) Operating lease liabilities, current $ 5,650   $ 5,060   Operating lease liabilities
(non-current) Operating lease liabilities $ 46,996   $ 28,847   Total operating lease liabilities $ 52,646   $ 33,907   During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company vacated the prior headquarters in New York, New York and recorded impairments of
$ 1.5
million and $ 1.7
million, respectively, to its
right-of-use assets associated with the vacated location based on projected or actual sublease rental income and actual or estimated sublease commencement dates and the remeasurement of its operating lease liabilities associated with the modification of
certain leases and the early termination of certain leases within the suite of leases pertaining to its prior headquarters. The impairment analyses were performed at the asset group level and the impairment charges were estimated by comparing the fair value of each asset group based on the expected cash flows to its respective book value. The Company determined the discount rate for each asset group based on the approximate interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar remaining terms and payments as of the impairment date. Significant judgment was required to estimate the fair value of each asset group and actual results could vary from the estimates, resulting in potential future adjustments to amounts previously recorded. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 assets acquired in exchange for new operating lease liabilities pertained to the new headquarters and was $ 17.0
million. Lease expense primarily pertains to operating lease cost. Lease expense for operating leases was $ 2.2
million and $ 1.5
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Lease expense for operating leases was $ 6.7
million and $ 3.7
million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These lease expenses were included within general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Sublease income for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was immaterial and was recorded within other income (expense), net on the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations. Cash flows used in operating activities related to operating leases was approximately $ 2.3
million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. 8.     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Litigation
On September 1, 2022, plaintiff Amber Farmer filed a complaint against BarkBox, Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Farmer v. BarkBox, Inc., No. 2:22-cv-06242 (C.D. Cal.). The plaintiff alleges that BarkBox violates California’s Automatic Renewal Law, Unfair Competition Law, and Consumers Legal Remedies Act by failing to adequately disclose the automatic renewal of BarkBox’s subscription plans. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class containing all consumers who purchased a subscription from BarkBox in California. We filed a Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Compel Arbitration on November 4, 2022. While we intend to vigorously defend against this litigation, this case is at a very early stage and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our defense. For this same reason, we cannot currently estimate the loss or the range of possible losses we may experience in connection with this litigation. 17 In addition, we are from time to time subject to, and are presently involved in, litigation and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. While it is not possible to determine the outcome of any legal proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matter described above, there are no pending lawsuits or claims that, individually or in the aggregate, may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. Our view and estimate related to these matters may change in the future, as new events and circumstances arise and as the matters continue to develop. 9.     INCOME TAXES The Company did
not
record a federal, state, or foreign income tax provision or benefit for the three months or
nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to the expected loss before income taxes to be incurred for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, and actual loss before income taxes incurred for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, as well as the Company’s continued maintenance of a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. 10.     OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)—NET Other income (expense)—net consisted of the following: Three Months Ended

$ ( 21,270 ) $ ( 13,241 ) $ ( 47,317 ) $ ( 31,589 ) Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding—basic and diluted 177,672,036   172,554,101   176,546,378   150,313,932   Net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders Net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders - basic and diluted $ ( 0.12 ) $ ( 0.08 ) $ ( 0.27 ) $ ( 0.21 )
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 , the Company’s potential dilutive securities, which include stock options, RSUs, warrants and convertible notes have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would be to reduce the net loss per share. Therefore, the weighted-average number of
18 shares of common stock outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 .
For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s potential dilutive securities, which include redeemable convertible preferred stock, stock options and warrants, have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would be to reduce the net loss per share. Therefore, the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021.
The Company excluded the following potential shares of common stock, presented based on amounts outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021 from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common shareholders for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect.
As of December 31, 2022 2021 Stock options to purchase common stock 16,068,852   23,902,292 Restricted stock units 8,615,450   1,979,396   Warrants to purchase common stock 13,036,333   13,036,333   2025 Convertible Notes as converted to common stock 8,390,774 7,952,919 The Company also had convertible notes outstanding for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, which could have obligated the Company and/or its stockholders to issue shares of common stock upon the occurrence of various future events at prices and in amounts that are not determinable until the occurrence of those future events. Because the necessary conditions for the conversion of these instruments had not been satisfied during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company excluded these instruments from the table above and the calculation of diluted net loss per share for the period. See Note 5, “Debt,” for additional details.
12.     SEGMENTS The Company applies ASC 280,
Segment Reporting , in determining reportable segments for its financial statement disclosure. The Company has
two
reportable segments: Direct to Consumer and Commerce. The Direct to Consumer segment derives revenue from the sale of BarkBox, Super Chewer, BARK Bright and BARK Food subscriptions, as well as product line sales through the Company’s website, BarkShop. The Commerce segment derives revenue from the sale of toys, BARK Bright and BARK Home products through major retailers and online marketplaces. Reporting in this format provides management with the financial information necessary to evaluate the success of the segments and the overall business. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments. The Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) reviews revenue and gross profit for both of the reportable segments. Gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue incurred by the segment. The Company does not allocate assets at the reportable segment level as these are managed on an entity wide group basis and, accordingly, the Company does not report asset information by segments. 19 Key financial performance measures of the segments including revenue, cost of revenue, and gross profit are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended  December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Direct to Consumer:
Revenue $ 120,075   $ 118,124   $ 356,018   $ 330,316   Cost of revenue 45,878   47,876   138,961   131,195   Gross profit 74,197   70,248   217,057   199,121   Commerce: Revenue 14,259   22,688   53,280   48,264   Cost of revenue 8,266   14,527   33,991   29,298   Gross profit 5,993   8,161   19,289   18,966   Consolidated: Revenue 134,334   140,812   409,298   378,580   Cost of revenue 54,144   62,403   172,952   160,493   Gross profit $ 80,190   $ 78,409   $ 236,346   $ 218,087   13.     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Delaware Section 205 Petition As previously disclosed, on February 7, 2023, the Company filed a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Court of Chancery”) pursuant to Section 205 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), seeking validation of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation increasing the authorized common stock of the Company (as further described below) and the shares issued pursuant thereto.
At a special meeting of the stockholders of the Company held on May 28, 2021, a majority of the then-outstanding shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock, voting as a single class, voted to approve the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which, among other things, increased the authorized shares of the Company’s common stock from
150,000,000
to
500,000,000
shares, eliminated its Class B common stock and renamed the Class A common stock as “common stock” (the “Charter Amendment”). A recent decision of the Court of Chancery has created uncertainty regarding the validity of the Charter Amendment and whether a separate vote of the majority of the then-outstanding shares of the Company’s Class A common stock would have been required under Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL. While the Company believes that a separate vote of the Class A common stock was not required to approve the Charter Amendment, in light of the Court of Chancery’s recent decision, the Company filed a petition in the Court of Chancery pursuant to Section 205 of the DGCL, which permits the Court of Chancery, in its discretion, to validate potentially defective corporate acts and stock after considering a variety of factors. As previously disclosed, the Court of Chancery has issued an order scheduling a hearing on the merits of the petition on February 20, 2023. Cost Reduction Initiative On February 9, 2023, the Company announced a cost reduction initiative involving approximately
12 %, or
126
employees, and curtailing the use of certain third-party vendors, consultants, and other contractors. The Company expects this initiative to improve its efficiency and further accelerate its path to sustainable profitability, as well as to better align its cost structure with the current macroeconomic environment and the Company’s strategic priorities.
20 The Company expects to record a charge of approximately $ 2.0
million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 consisting of cash severance payments. These costs will be included in the Company’s GAAP results, but will be excluded from the Company’s non-GAAP results. The Company expects that this initiative will be substantially completed by the end of the fiscal fourth quarter 2023, and the related cash payments disbursed by the end of fiscal first quarter 2024. 21 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended March 31, 2022 contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on May 31, 2022. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we”, “us”, “our”, “the Company” and “BARK”
are intended to mean the business and operations of BARK, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, present the financial position and results of operations of BARK, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Overview Founded in 2011, BARK is the world’s most dog-centric company, devoted to making dogs happy with the best products, services and content. Our dog-obsessed team applies its data-driven understanding of what makes each dog special by designing playstyle-specific toys, satisfying treats, great food for your dog’s breed, effective and easy to use dental care, and dog-first experiences that foster the health and happiness of dogs everywhere. We aim to build lifelong relationships with our customers and their pups in order to drive strong customer retention and lifetime value. BARK loyally serves dogs with themed toys and treats subscriptions, BarkBox and BARK Super Chewer; custom product collections through retail partners, including Target, PetSmart, and Walmart; high-quality, nutritious meals made for your breed with BARK Food; and products that meet dogs’ dental needs with BARK Bright. As a direct to consumer-first company, our growing data and machine-learning capabilities inform future product development and enable BARK to provide personalized experiences and product offerings for dog parents nationwide. Impact of COVID-19 and other Global Conditions The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business will depend on future developments related to the geographic spread of the disease, the duration and severity of the outbreak, travel restrictions, required social distancing, governmental mandates, business closures or governmental or business disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to prevent, contain and treat the virus and any additional government stimulus programs. These impacts are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. As this crisis unfolded, we monitored conditions closely and adapted our operations to meet federal, state and local standards, while continuing to meet the needs of the dogs and dog parents we serve and to ensure the safety and well-being of our team members. While conditions appear to be improving, we are still unable to predict the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence and spread of variants of COVID-19, and therefore the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. As such, risks still remain. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, an unprecedented and unexpected effect on the global economy, civil society, labor markets, and certain industries. As a result, it is difficult to predict the magnitude or scope of the impact these effects will or may have directly, or indirectly, on our business, operating results and financial condition.
In the past, we have experienced increases in inbound freight costs due to the challenges in the import market, as transpacific ships and trade lanes continue to be overburdened with volume and experience a significant shortage of equipment and capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in freight costs and supply chain disruptions may continue and could impact our business, in particular as a result of global conditions that are created or driven by market factors or international events, such as increased inflation and the war in the Ukraine.
22 In 2022, various central banks around the world (including the Federal Reserve in the United States) raised interest rates. While these rate increases have not had a significant adverse impact on our financial condition to date, the impact of such rate increases on the overall financial markets and the economy may adversely impact us in the future. In addition, the global economy has experienced and is continuing to experience high levels of inflation and global supply chain disruptions. We continue to monitor these supply chain, inflation and interest rate factors, as well as the uncertainty resulting from the overall economic environment. In addition, although we have no operations in or direct exposure to Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, we have experienced limited constraints in availability and increasing costs required to obtain some materials and supplies due, in part, to the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict on the global economy. To date, our business has not been materially impacted by the conflict, however, as the conflict continues or worsens, it may impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot predict the duration or magnitude of such impacts.
Please refer to the “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and the “Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Key Performance Indicators We use the following key financial and operating metrics to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, project our future performance, and make strategic decisions. These key financial and operating metrics should be read in conjunction with the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

a $2.00 or 6.4%
increase in A verage Order Value offset by a
4.5%
or
0.2 million
decrease in Subscription Shipments. Commerce revenue decreased by $8.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by an acceleration in timing of seasonal product orders into our second quarter which in prior years shipped in our third quarter.

The increase in Direct to Consumer gross profit is primarily attributable to lower costs from our suppliers. The decrease in Commerce gross profit is primarily attributable lower volume as discussed above.
Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased
4.0%
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to the larger percent of revenue derived from our Direct to Consumer business in the most recent period. Direct to Consumer gross margin was 61.8%, 232 basis points
higher than the same period last year, while commerce gross margin was 42.0%,
606 basis points higher than the same period last year. The increase in commerce gross margin is primarily attributable to lower
promotional costs in the current quarter, as most of the seasonal promotional costs fell into our fiscal second quarter. 27 Operating Expenses General and Administrative Expense Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 $ Change % Change ( in thousands) General and administrative

This increase during the period was primarily due to an impairment and increased depreciation charges in connection with vacating our prior headquarters, in addition to increased compensation expense due to an increase in headcount. These increases were offset by a reduction of detention and demurrage charges, and lower outbound shipping costs primarily as a result of a 4.5% decrease in Subscription Shipments.

Commerce revenue increased by $5.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021.

$ 233,937  $ 216,369  $ 17,568  8.1  % Percentage of revenue 57.2  % 57.2  % General and administrative expense increased by $17.6 million, or 8.1%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021. This increase during the period was primarily due to increased compensation expense due to an increase in headcount, increased fulfillment and shipping costs, an impairment and increased depreciation charges in connection with vacating our prior headquarters, and increased donation expense incurred during the fiscal first quarter. These increases were offset by a decrease in professional and legal fees attributable to costs incurred in the prior year associated with the Merger.

30 lower media spend in connection with acquiring approximately 181 thousand fewer subscribers during the period, offset by increased employment costs due to an increase in headcount.

million, or 3.5% , for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months December 31, 2021. This decrease was due primarily to the Company not incurring non-cash interest in the current period related to the convertible promissory notes which converted in connection with the closing of the Merger in the prior period. Interest expense was further offset by interest income of $0.1 million derived from our money market account established in the fiscal third quarter.

for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in other income (expense), net, was primarily due to a decrease of
$27.5 million of other income related to the changes in fair value of our warrant liabilities, offset by an increase in other income of $1.0 million. Additionally, the Company incurred $2.6 million of expense related to the loss on extinguishment of debt incurred from conversion of the convertible promissory notes issued in 2019 and 2020 in connection with the Merger during the prior period.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, management believes that Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted Net Loss Margin, Adjusted Net Loss Per Common Share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Free Cash Flow, all non-GAAP financial measures (together the “Non-GAAP Measures”), provide investors with additional useful information in evaluating our performance. We calculate Adjusted Net Loss as net income loss, adjusted to exclude: (1) stock-based compensation expense, (2) change in fair value of warrants and derivatives, (3) sales and use tax expense (income), (4) transaction costs associated with the Merger, (5) executive transition costs (6) non-cash duplicate rent expense incurred during the relocation of our corporate headquarters, (7) demurrage fees related to freight, (8) asset impairment charges incurred relating to the relocation of our corporate headquarters, and (9) other items (as defined below). We calculate Adjusted Net Loss Margin by dividing Adjusted Net Loss for the period by Revenue for the period. We calculate Adjusted Net Loss Per Common Share by dividing Adjusted Net Loss for the period by weighted average common shares used to compute net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the period. 31 We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted to exclude: (1) interest income (expense), net, (2) depreciation and amortization, (3) stock-based compensation expense, (4) change in fair value of warrants and derivatives, (5) sales and use tax expense (income), (6) transaction costs associated with the Merger, (7) executive transition costs (8) non-cash duplicate rent expense incurred during the relocation of our corporate headquarters, (9) demurrage fees related to freight, (10) asset impairment charges relating to the relocation of our corporate headquarters and (11) other items (as defined below). We calculate Adjusted EBITDA Margin by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for the period by revenue for the period. We calculate Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. The Non-GAAP Measures are financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that the Non-GAAP Measures, when taken together with our financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance and facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of the Non-GAAP Measures are helpful to our investors as they are measures used by management in assessing the health of our business, determining incentive compensation and evaluating our operating performance, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. The Non-GAAP Measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations of the Non-GAAP Measures include that (1) the measures do not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future, (2) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect these capital expenditures, (3) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense, which is an ongoing expense for our company, (4) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect other non-operating expenses, including interest expense. In addition, our use of the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate the Non-GAAP Measures in the same manner, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, when evaluating our performance, you should consider the Non-GAAP Measures alongside other financial measures, including our net income (loss) and other results stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and (5) Free cash flow does not represent the total residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes and does not reflect our future contractual commitments. 32 The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Loss to Net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the calculation of net loss margin, Adjusted Net Loss Margin and Adjusted Net Loss Per Common Share for the periods presented: Adjusted Net Loss Three Months Ended

Historically, we had collected state or local sales, use, or other similar taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we only had physical presence. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. that state and local jurisdictions may, at least in certain circumstances, enforce a sales and use tax collection obligation on remote vendors that have no physical presence in such jurisdiction. A number of states have positioned themselves to require sales and use tax collection by remote vendors and/or by online marketplaces. The details and effective dates of these collection requirements vary from state to state and accordingly, we recorded a liability in those periods in which we created economic nexus based on each state’s requirements. Accordingly, we
now collect, remit, and report sales tax in all states that impose a sales tax.
(2) Transactions costs represent non-recurring consulting and advisory costs with respect to the merger agreement entered into with Northern Star Acquisition Corp. on December 16, 2020. (3) Executive transition costs includes recruiting, and consulting expenses incurred by the Company. (4) Non-cash duplicate rent expense incurred during the relocation of our corporate headquarters, and rent expense net of sublease income incurred pertaining to our prior headquarters upon relocation. (5) Demurrage fees are raised when the full container is not moved out of the port/terminal for unpacking within the allowed free days offered by the shipping line. The charge is levied by the shipping line to the importer. (6) For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 the Company vacated the prior headquarters in New York, New York and recorded impairments of
$1.5 million to our right-of-use assets associated with the vacated location based on projected or actual sublease rental income and actual or estimated sublease commencement dates and the remeasurement of our operating lease liabilities associated with the modification of
certain leases and the early termination of certain leases within the suite of leases pertaining to our prior headquarters. (7) For the three months ended December 31, 2021, other items is primarily comprised of costs related to unrealized business ventures of $1.5 million, and gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million. For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, other items is comprised of loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.0 million, costs related to unrealized business ventures of $1.5 million, SOX implementation fees of $0.4 million,, loss on exercise of warrants of $0.3 million and restructuring related expenses of $0.1 million 34 The following table presents a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP, for each of the periods indicated: Free Cash Flow Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Free cash flow reconciliation: Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 5,077  $ (38,518) $ (14,486) $ (146,537) Capital expenditures (4,746) (6,602) (18,854) (17,605) Free cash flow $ 331  $ (45,120) $ (33,340) $ (164,142) 35
Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, we have funded our operations with proceeds from sales of our capital stock and proceeds from borrowings in addition to cash generated by our operations. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $164.2 million. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided by our operating activities and proceeds from borrowings (as defined below), will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. We are required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants related to our borrowing agreements, which we expect to be in compliance with during the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our pace of new and existing customer growth and our investments in partnerships and unexplored channels. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing.
2025 Convertible Notes On November 27, 2020, the Company issued $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes (the “2025 Convertible Notes”) to Magnetar Capital, LLC (“Magnetar”) under an indenture, dated as of November 27, 2020, between Legacy BARK and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and collateral agent (the “Indenture”). The Company received net proceeds of approximately $74.7 million from the sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes, after deducting fees and expenses of approximately $0.3 million. The Company recorded the expenses as a discount to the note and will amortize the expenses over the term of the note. The 2025 Convertible Notes will mature on December 1, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The Company used approximately $27.6 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes to repay the previously outstanding term loans with Western Alliance Bank and Pinnacle, which included $2.0 million of early repayment fees related to the Pinnacle loan.
The 2025 Convertible Notes are governed by the Indenture. The 2025 Convertible Notes bear interest at the annual rate of 5.50%, payable entirely in payment-in-kind annually on December 1 st
of each year commencing December 1, 2021, compounded annually. The accrued interest of
$4.4 million and $4.2 million was paid-in-kind through an increase of the outstanding principal on the 2025 Convertible Notes on December 1, 2022 and 2021, respectively. If the 2025 Convertible Notes are not converted into common stock by the maturity date, the Company must repay the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest.
The 2025 Convertible Notes contain call and put options to be settled in cash contingent upon the occurrence of a change of control and a default interest rate increase of 3.0% applicable upon the occurrence of an event of default that when evaluated under the guidance of ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging , are embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation at fair value. The fair value calculation includes Level 3 inputs including the estimated fair value of the Company’s common stock and assumptions regarding the probability that the contingent call or put will be exercised or an event of default will occur. Management determined that the probability that the contingent events will occur was near zero at inception and has remained near zero as of December 31, 2022. Therefore, the Company did not record a derivative liability related to these features as of December 31, 2022. The Company will assess the probability of occurrence quarterly during the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company had $83.5 million and $79.2 million, respectively, of outstanding borrowings under the note purchase agreement governing the purchase and sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes agreement. Western Alliance Bank—Line of Credit and Term Loan In October 2017, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Western Alliance Agreement”) and issued a warrant to purchase preferred stock (“Initial Western Alliance Warrant”) to Western Alliance Bank
36 (“Western Alliance”), which provided for a secured revolving line of credit (the “Credit Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $35.0 million with a maturity date of October 12, 2020. On December 7, 2018, the Company amended the Western Alliance Agreement, which included the issuance of a warrant to purchase common stock (“Subsequent Western Alliance Warrant”) to Western Alliance. The modification to the Western Alliance Agreement provided for an additional term loan of $10.0 million at issuance and an incremental seasonal loan of $5.0 million. The seasonal loan matured and was repaid on March 31, 2020. The term loan had a maturity date of December 31, 2021.
On July 31, 2020, the Company amended the Western Alliance Agreement and extended the expiration of the warrants to July 31, 2030. The modification to the Western Alliance Agreement amended the maturity date of the Credit Facility to August 12, 2021.
On November 27, 2020, the Company repaid the outstanding $10.0 million principal of the term loan with Western Alliance Bank, as well as $0.2 million of early repayment fees, using proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes. See further discussion of the 2025 Convertible Notes issuance above.
In conjunction with the 2025 Convertible Notes issuance, the Company amended the Western Alliance Agreement to extend the Credit Facility repayment date from August 12, 2021 to December 31, 2021. On January 22, 2021, the Company amended the Western Alliance Agreement to extend the Credit Facility maturity date to May 31, 2022. On October 29, 2021, the Company and Western Alliance entered into the eleventh loan and security modification agreement, which increased the sublimit for foreign exchange services and export, import, and standby letters of credit under the Company’s existing loan and security agreement with Western Alliance
to $2.7 million. On May 27, 2022, the Company and Western Alliance entered into the twelfth loan and security modification agreement, which extended the Credit Facility maturity date to June 30, 2022. On June 30, 2022, the Company and Western Alliance entered into the thirteenth loan and security modification agreement, which extended the Credit Facility maturity date to July 15, 2022. On August 3, 2022, the Company and Western Alliance entered into the fourteenth loan and security modification agreement, which extended the Credit Facility maturity date to May 31, 2023. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility, as amended, is equal to (i) the greater of the prime rate that is published in the Money Rates section of The Wall Street Journal from time to time (the “Prime Rate”)
and five and one quarter percent
5.25%, plus (ii) half of one percent (0.50%), per annum. The Credit Facility has a borrowing base subject to an amount equal to eighty percent (80.00%) of the Company’s trailing three months of subscription revenue and an amount equal to (80.00%) of certain of the Company’s customer accounts receivable when a collateral audit is performed and sixty percent (60.00%) when no such collateral audit is performed. Western Alliance has first perfected security in substantially all of the Company’s assets, including its rights to its intellectual property.
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. The full amount of the Credit Facility of $35.0 million is available to be borrowed by the Company if or when needed through the termination date of the agreement of May 31, 2023. Under the terms of this Credit Facility, the Company is required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including covenants to maintain certain liquidity amounts, as defined in the amended Western Alliance Agreement. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company was compliant with its financial covenants. 37 Cash Flows Comparison of the Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Net cash used in operating activities $ (14,486) $ (146,537) Net cash used in investing activities (18,854) (17,605) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (1,850) 355,382  Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (18) 1  Net increase (decrease) in cash and restricted cash
$ (35,208) $ 191,240  Cash flows used in Operating Activities Net cash flows used in operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to our activities other than investing and financing activities.
Net cash flows used in operating activities is derived by adjusting our net loss for: • non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and other non-cash income or expenses; and • changes in operating assets and liabilities reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions.
For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $14.5 million. The $14.5 million of net cash used in operating activities consisted of net loss of $47.3 million adjusted for non-cash charges totaling
$20.4
million and a net increase of $12.4 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of $6.5 million for changes in fair value of warrants,
$11.9
million for stock based compensation, and $6.5 million for depreciation and amortization. The increase in our net operating assets and liabilities was driven by a reduction of inventory of $10.3 million, accounts receivables of $4.4 million related to increased collections, and partial receipt of the new office’s tenant improvements allowance of $6.2 million. The increase in our net operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 5.3 million, and other liabilities of 2.1 million. For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $146.5 million. The $146.5 million of net cash used in operating activities consisted of net loss of $31.6 million adjusted for non-cash charges totaling
$17.7
million and a net decrease of $97.2 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of $38.9 million for changes in fair value of warrants,
$11.0
million for stock based compensation, $2.0 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $2.9 million for depreciation and amortization. The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was driven by the changes in inventory of $73.2 million to support current demand, accounts payable and accrued expenses of $12.3 million related to increased expenditures to support general business growth, as well as the timing of payments, other liabilities of $8.7 million, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of
$0.4 million. The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by the change in deferred revenue of $9.0 million, and accounts receivable of $11.3 million. Cash flows used in Investing Activities For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $18.9 million and
$17.6 million, respectively , primarily due to capital expenditures. 38 Cash flows provided by Financing Activities For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in financing activities was $1.9 million, primarily due to the payment of capital leases of $2.3 million, and tax payments related to the issuance of common stock of $0.6 million offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $1.0 million. For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $355.4 million, primarily due to proceeds of $227.1 million p roceeds from the Merger and proceeds from the PIPE
of $200.0 million. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the repayments of outstanding borrowings on our line of credit of
$34.3
million, payments of transaction costs of $25.2 million, p ayment of deferred underwriting fees $8.9
million, and rep ayment of the outstanding Paycheck Protection Program loan of
$5.2 million . Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about items that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Except as described in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recent Accounting Pronouncements,” to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended March 31, 2022 contained in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on May 31, 2022. 39 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk We had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $164.2 million as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company held $55.1 million in a money market account. The Company does not have any other investments. We have not been exposed, nor do we anticipate being exposed, to material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We are primarily exposed to changes in short-term interest rates with respect to our cost of borrowing under our Western Alliance Agreement. As of December 31, 2022 there are no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. We monitor our cost of borrowing under our the Credit Facility, taking into account our funding requirements, and our expectations for short-term rates in the future. A hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate on our Western Alliance Agreement for all periods presented would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Inflation Risk We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Foreign Exchange Risk We operate our business primarily within the United States and currently execute the majority of our transactions in U.S. dollars. We have not utilized hedging strategies with respect to such foreign exchange exposure. This limited foreign currency translation risk is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 40 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer), Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), and Vice President of Accounting, Controller (Principal Accounting Officer) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to the material weaknesses identified and described below. Notwithstanding the ineffective disclosure controls and procedures as a result of the identified material weakness, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, due to the material weaknesses identified and described below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In the course of preparing the financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 BARK identified material weaknesses related to:
a. the insufficient review of
account reconciliations for certain account balances;
b. the lack of formalized processes and controls around inventory management; c. the
improper accounting for the review of complex or non-routine transactions; and d. the lack of effective internal controls around change management and those internal controls that would restrict access to financial systems to appropriate users and ensure that appropriate segregation of duties is maintained. Specifically, certain change management controls were not adhered to, and certain personnel had access to financial applications, programs and data beyond that needed to perform their individual job responsibilities and without independent monitoring. In addition, certain financial personnel had incompatible duties which allowed for the creation, review and processing of certain financial data without independent review and authorization. This material weakness affects substantially all financial statement accounts.
Remediation Efforts to Address Material Weaknesses We have identified and implemented, and continue to implement, certain remediation efforts to improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These remediation efforts are ongoing and include the following measures to address the material weaknesses identified: 41 We have incorporated additional controls as well as enhanced existing controls to adequately document preparation activities, validation of data inputs, and evidence the precision of review for certain accounting processes, including account reconciliations.
We are in the process of improving and updating our inventory management system, process and controls. We have redesigned and enhanced existing controls related to the identification of and accounting for certain non-routine, unusual or complex transactions; including the acquisition of additional technical accounting research tools, increased frequency and depth of leadership communication requirements, the addition of qualified personnel in various positions of financial reporting responsibility and oversight, and enhanced review procedures. We are designing and implementing improved processes and controls for requesting, authorizing, and reviewing user access and activity, and changes to key information systems which impact our financial reporting, including identifying access to roles where manual business process controls may be required. This implementation will include the addition of preventive control activities associated with user access and change management within our key applications which impact our financial reporting, as well as certain detective controls which review user access and activity logs. We have hired additional personnel with relevant experience and engaged external consultants with appropriate internal controls experience to assist us in further analysis of the design and implementation of certain internal controls, including the assessment and mitigation of incompatible duties and roles, to address the identified deficiencies. While we believe the steps taken to date and those planned for implementation will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we have not completed all remediation efforts. We will not be able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until management has determined through testing, that the controls have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Except as disclosed above, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 42 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On September 1, 2022, plaintiff Amber Farmer filed a complaint against BarkBox, Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Farmer v. BarkBox, Inc., No. 2:22-cv-06242 (C.D. Cal.). The plaintiff alleges that BarkBox violates California’s Automatic Renewal Law, Unfair Competition Law, and Consumers Legal Remedies Act by failing to adequately disclose the automatic renewal of BarkBox’s subscription plans. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class containing all consumers who purchased a subscription from BarkBox in California. We filed a Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Compel Arbitration on November 4, 2022. While we intend to vigorously defend against this litigation, this case is at a very early stage and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our defense. For this same reason, we cannot currently estimate the loss or the range of possible losses we may experience in connection with this litigation. In addition, we are from time to time subject to, and are presently involved in, litigation and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. While it is not possible to determine the outcome of any legal proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matter described above, there are no pending lawsuits or claims that, individually or in the aggregate, may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. Our view and estimate related to these matters may change in the future, as new events and circumstances arise and as the matters continue to develop. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not known to us or that we consider immaterial as of the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. This quarterly report on Form 10-Q also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below. See also "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Risks Related to Our Strategy
Our future operating performance is subject to numerous challenges and uncertainties.
Our recent rapid growth may not be indicative of our future operating performance, which will depend on our ability to leverage our competitive strengths and execute on our strategy. Our competitive strengths include:
our proprietary product and customer data; strong customer relationships; vertically integrated design, development and manufacturing of our products; and omnichannel approach including both direct to consumer and retail sales. Our strategy is to expand into new product categories, in particular the food category; create a unified customer experience; and focus on the path to profitability. Our ability to leverage our competitive strengths and execute on our strategy is subject to numerous challenges and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the following: • costs or other issues with acquiring new customers and retaining existing customers;
• adverse impacts on shipping and fulfillment services and costs; • changes in trends and consumer preferences; • interruptions in our business due to technology failures, cybersecurity breaches or labor shortages;
• our ability to retain existing suppliers and attract new suppliers and scale our supply chain;
• our ability to develop a unified, scalable, high-performance technology and fulfillment infrastructure; • our ability to hire and retain talented, experienced people at all levels of our organization; • impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 43 • changes in the macro-economic environment, such as inflation, increasing interest rates, instability in the financial markets, changes in the labor markets, and political, economic and social instability, such as war in the Ukraine, in particular as such changes impact consumer discretionary spending. If we fail meet the challenges or navigate the uncertainties described above, as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.
We may fail to acquire new customers in a cost-effective manner.
In order to expand our customer base, we must appeal to customers who have historically purchased their dog products from other retailers, such as traditional brick and mortar retailers or the websites of our competitors. While we believe that many of our new customers originate from word-of-mouth and other non-paid referrals from our current customers, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments to acquire new customers. We must be able to appropriately, effectively and efficiently allocate our marketing investment for multiple products, including: accurately identifying, targeting and reaching our audience of current and potential customers with our marketing messages; selecting the right marketplace, media and specific media vehicle in which to advertise; adapting quickly to changes in the algorithmic logic, privacy policies, and other procedures used by search engines, social media platforms and other third party platforms; identifying the most effective and efficient level of spending in each marketplace, media and specific media vehicle; determining the appropriate creative message and media mix for advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures; managing marketing costs, including creative and media expenses, in order to maintain acceptable customer acquisition costs; differentiating our products as compared to other products; creating greater brand awareness; driving traffic to our website, and websites of our retail partners and adapting our marketing tactics as e-commerce, search, and social networking evolve. Also, search engines, social media platforms frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our website can be negatively affected. Moreover, a search engine or social media platform could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results, causing our website to place lower in search query results. In addition, social networking and e-commerce channels continue to rapidly evolve, including with regard to their policies and procedures, and we may be unable to cost-effectively develop or maintain a presence within these channels. If the costs of acquiring new customers exceeds our expectations, we may not be able to acquire the necessary number of customers who purchase products in volumes sufficient to grow our business and generate the scale necessary to achieve operational efficiency and/or our margins could decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may be unable to maintain a high level of customer engagement or protect our brand and reputation.
Our strong customer relationships and our brand and reputation are the basis for the high-level customer engagement that drives increases to our average order volume and our overall growth. A significant portion of our revenue is recurring revenue from subscription customers, especially those customers who are highly engaged and purchase our add-to-box offerings or our other offerings, such as BARK Food and BARK Bright.
Maintaining and protecting our brand and reputation depends largely on our ability to provide our customers with an engaging and personalized customer experience, including valued services, high-quality merchandise, appropriate prices and access to highly-trained customer support representatives. Customer complaints or negative reviews or publicity about our products, services, merchandise, monthly themes, delivery times, or customer support, especially on social media platforms, could harm our brand and reputation and diminish customer use of our services and the trust that our customers place in us. Also, if our customers no longer find our products appealing or appropriately priced, they may make fewer purchases and may cancel their subscriptions or stop purchasing products. Even if our existing customers continue to find our offerings appealing, they may decide to reduce their subscription and purchase less merchandise over time as their interest in new dog products declines. Failure to maintain our high level of engagement and protect our brand and reputation with our customers would cause our revenue to decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may not be able to accurately predict consumer trends, successfully introduce new products, improve existing products, or expand into new offerings.
Our growth depends, in part, on our ability to successfully introduce new products to our existing BarkBox and Super Chewer subscribers and to introduce new product lines, including BARK Home (everyday products), BARK Bright (dental, health and wellness), and BARK Food (personalized food blend), and to improve and reposition our
44 existing products to meet the requirements of our customers and the needs of their dogs. To be successful, we must accurately predict and respond to evolving consumer trends, demands and preferences, including predicting monthly themes for our BarkBox and Super Chewer subscriptions, that will resonate with customers as timely and clever. The development and introduction of new products and expansion into new offerings also involves considerable costs. Any new product or offering may not generate sufficient customer interest to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion and could result in a decrease in customer retention, a reduction in purchases or negatively affect our brand and reputation. If we are unable to anticipate, identify, develop or market products, or create new offerings, that respond to changes in customer requirements and preferences, or if our new product introductions, repositioned products, or new offerings fail to gain consumer acceptance, we may be unable to grow our business as anticipated, or our revenue, margins and profitability may decline or not improve, which could materially adversely affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends on the continuing efforts of our key employees and our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and senior management.
Our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent on the contributions of our senior management and other key personnel. In addition, our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. The market for such employees is competitive, in particular, due to the ongoing labor market effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualified employees are in high demand and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain these employees. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or other key employees or our inability to recruit and develop mid-level managers could impede our ability to execute our business plan and we may be unable to find adequate replacements. All of our employees are at-will employees, meaning that they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry could be extremely difficult to replace. If we fail to retain talented senior management and other key personnel, or if we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
We face challenges due to our reliance on third party sales channels to sell and distribute our products.
We sell some of our products through a network of retailers and e-tailers (in addition to our direct sales channel). Our products are available through Amazon.com as well as in retail locations including Target, Petco, PetSmart, Walmart, and many others. We depend on these indirect sales channel partners to distribute and sell our products to dog parents, which subjects us to a number of challenges, including: • The sales and business practices, reputation or failure to comply with laws and regulations, of or by our sales channel partners, of which we may or may not be aware, may affect our business and reputation;
• Adverse changes in our relationships with our sales channel partners could impact sales of our products;
• Economic conditions, labor issues, natural disasters, regional or global pandemics, evolving consumer preferences, and purchasing patterns of our distribution partners, or competition between our sales channels, could result in sales channel disruption;
• Our sales channel partners also sell products offered by our competitors and, in the case of retailer house brands, may also be our competitors;
• Certain of our sales channel partners could decide to de-emphasize the product categories that we offer, and certain of our third-party e-commerce partners could change their algorithmic logic, policies or procedures making our products harder for customers to find or remove them from e-commerce sites altogether; and
• We must build relationships with new channel partners and adapt to new distribution and marketing models as we expand new product categories and markets, which may require significant management attention and operational resources and may affect our accounting, including revenue recognition, gross margins, and the ability to make comparisons from period to period.
If we fail to effectively meet the challenges described above our business and future operating results will be materially adversely affected.
45 Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Macro-Economic Environment We rely on consumer discretionary spending, which may be adversely affected by economic downturns and other macroeconomic conditions or trends.
Our business depends on consumer discretionary spending. Some of the factors that may negatively influence consumer spending include a high rate of inflation and general uncertainty regarding the overall future political and economic environment; higher levels of unemployment; higher consumer debt levels; reductions in net worth, declines in asset values, and related market uncertainty; home foreclosures and reductions in home values; fluctuating interest rates and credit availability; global pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the loosening of restrictions as the pandemic conditions improve; fluctuating fuel and other energy costs; and fluctuating commodity prices. Furthermore, any increases in consumer discretionary spending during times of crisis may be temporary, such as those related to government stimulus programs or remote-work environments, and consumer spending may decrease when those programs or circumstances end. In addition, economic conditions in certain regions may be affected by natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, earthquakes, and wildfires; other public health crises; and other major unforeseen events. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including the merchandise that we offer, generally decline during recessionary periods or periods of economic uncertainty, when disposable income is reduced or when there is a reduction in consumer confidence. Any decline in consumer discretionary spending could negatively impact our revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic and related government, private sector and individual consumer responses.
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain and may cause disruptions to our operations. Additional federal or state mandates ordering the shutdown of non-essential businesses could also impact our ability to take or fulfill our subscribers’ or customers’ orders and operate our business. Many of our personnel are working remotely, which could have a negative impact on the execution of our business plans and operations. While we have implemented what we believe to be a comprehensive protocol to ensure the safety and well-being of employees returning to the office, including daily health screenings and making available personal protection equipment, these measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. Natural disasters, power outages, connectivity issues, or other events that impact our employees’ ability to work remotely, could disrupt business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working may also result in consumer privacy, IT security and fraud concerns as well as increase our exposure to potential wage and hour issues. Operations of our fulfillment centers may be substantially disrupted by additional federal or state mandates ordering shutdowns of non-essential services or by the inability of our employees to travel to work. Our plans to open new fulfillment centers or to expand the capacity of our existing fulfillment centers over the next few years may also be delayed or be more costly. Uncertainty and unpredictability around the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated business disruptions or resurgences or new strains continues to adversely impact national and global economies and could continue to negatively impact consumer spending on which we rely. While conditions appear to be improving, we are still unable to predict whether any resurgences or new strains of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Risks Related to our Manufacturing, Inventory and Supply Chain Our business critically relies on a limited number of suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners.
We rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers, suppliers and logistics providers to manufacture and transport our products. We do not currently have alternative or replacement providers and we do not generally maintain long-term supply contracts with any of these providers. We face a number of risks relating to these providers, including: • Our suppliers, manufacturers or logistics partners could be impacted by a natural disaster, an epidemic such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or other interruptions at a particular location;
• Our manufacturers and suppliers are primarily located in Asia, which introduces risks related to geopolitical developments and differences in regulatory standards and legal systems; • Our existing supply channels may not be able to satisfy a significant increase in demand for our products, or we may need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier. It could take a significant amount of time
46 to identify a manufacturer or supplier that has the capability and resources to manufacture our products to our specifications in sufficient volume, and with acceptable quality control, technical capabilities, responsiveness and service, financial stability, regulatory compliance, and labor and other ethical practices; • Our current product purchases are centralized among a few manufacturers and suppliers to realize substantial cost savings, which exposes us to credit and other risks, including insolvency, financial difficulties, supply chain delays or other factors may result in our manufacturers or suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us; and
• We have signed a number of contracts whose performance depends upon third party suppliers delivering products on schedule to meet our contractual commitments. Concentration in the number of our manufacturers and suppliers could lead to delays in the delivery of products or components, and possible resultant breaches of contracts that we have entered into with our customers; increases in the prices we must pay for products; problems with product quality; and other concerns. Any of the above risks could delay delivery of our products to customers in a timely and cost effective manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
We face challenges due to limited control over our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics partners.
We have limited control over our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics partners, which subjects us to the following challenges, many of which have materialized due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including: failure to satisfy demand for our products; reduced control over delivery timing, product reliability, the manufacturing process and components used in our products; limited ability to develop comprehensive manufacturing specifications that take into account any materials shortages or substitutions; variance in the manufacturing capability of our third-party manufacturers; price increases; failure of a significant supplier, manufacturer, or logistics partner to perform its obligations for technical, market, or other reasons; misappropriation of our intellectual property; changes in local economic conditions in the jurisdictions where our suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners are located; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, tariffs, taxes, and other charges on imports, as well as trade restrictions and restrictions on currency exchange or the transfer of funds; and insufficient warranties and indemnities on components supplied to our manufacturers or performance by our partners. If we fail to meet the challenges described above, our business and future operating results will be materially adversely affected. Shipping, which is subject to numerous risks, is a critical part of our business.
We currently rely on third-party national, regional and local logistics providers to deliver our products. We may not be able to negotiate acceptable pricing and other terms with these providers, or these providers may experience performance problems or other difficulties in processing our orders or delivering our products to customers. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship merchandise to customers may be negatively affected by factors beyond our and these providers’ control, including inclement weather, natural disasters, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other events specifically impacting our or other shipping partners, such as labor disputes, financial difficulties, system failures and other disruptions to the operations of the shipping companies on which we rely. We are also subject to risks of damage or loss during delivery by our shipping vendors. If the products ordered by our customers are not delivered in a timely fashion or are damaged or lost during the delivery process, our customers could become dissatisfied and cease buying our products. Further, due to the effects of COVID-19, there may be disruptions and delays in national, regional and local shipping, which may negatively impact our subscribers’ and customers’ experience. Changes to the terms of our shipping arrangements and delays or failures in delivery of our products may have a material adverse effect on our margins and profitability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be unable to manage the complexities created by our omnichannel operations. Our omnichannel operations, such as offering our products through our website, on third party websites and in traditional brick and mortar stores, create additional complexities in our ability to manage inventory levels, as well as certain operational issues, including timely shipping and refunds. Accordingly, our success depends to a large degree on continually evolving the processes and technology that enable us to plan and manage inventory levels and fulfill orders, address any related operational issues and further align channels to optimize our omnichannel operations. If we are unable to successfully manage these complexities, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. 47 If we are unable to implement appropriate systems, procedures and controls, we may not be able to successfully offer our products, grow our business and account for transactions in an appropriate and timely manner. Our ability to successfully offer our products, grow our business and account for transactions in an appropriate and timely manner requires an effective planning and management process and certain other automated management and accounting systems. We currently do not have an integrated enterprise resource planning system and certain other automated management and accounting systems. We periodically update our operations and financial systems, procedures and controls; however, our current procedures may not scale proportionately with our business growth or with becoming a public company. Our systems will continue to require automation, modifications and improvements to respond to current and future changes in our business. Failure to implement in a timely manner appropriate internal systems, procedures and controls could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to successfully optimize, operate and manage our fulfillment centers and shipping services.
If we do not optimize and operate our fulfillment centers and shipping services successfully and efficiently, it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment capacity, an increase in costs or impairment charges or harm to our business in other ways. In addition, if we do not have sufficient fulfillment or shipping capacity or experience a problem fulfilling or shipping orders in a timely manner, our customers may experience delays in receiving their purchases, which could harm our reputation and our relationship with our customers. We also anticipate the need to add additional fulfillment center and shipping capacity as our business continues to grow. We may not be able to locate suitable facilities or services on commercially acceptable terms in accordance with our expansion plans, or recruit qualified managerial and operational supply personnel to support our expansion plans. If we are unable to secure new facilities for the expansion of our fulfillment and shipping operations, recruit qualified personnel to support any such facilities, or effectively control expansion-related expenses, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Risk Related to Our Industry Our estimate of the size of our addressable market may prove to be inaccurate.
Data for retail sales of dog products is collected for most, but not all channels, and as a result, it is difficult to accurately estimate the size of the market and predict with certainty the rate at which the market for our products will grow, if at all. While our market size estimate was made in good faith and is based on assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable, this estimate may not be accurate. If our estimates of the size of our addressable market are not accurate, our potential for future growth may be less than we currently anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We may not be able to compete effectively in the dog products and services retail industry.
The dog products and services retail industry, in particular on the Internet, is highly competitive and we expect this competition to continue to increase. We compete with pet product retail stores, supermarkets, warehouse clubs and other mass and general retail and online merchandisers. We also compete with a number of specialty dog supply stores and independent dog stores, catalog retailers and other specialty e-tailers. As we expand our offerings, such as our BARK Food line, we will face additional competition. In the dog food category, there are numerous brands and products that compete for shelf space and sales, with competition based primarily upon brand recognition as well as loyalty, product packaging, quality and innovation, taste, nutrition, breadth of product line, price and convenience. Many of these current competitors have, and potential competitors may have, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger fulfillment infrastructures, greater technical capabilities, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and larger customer bases than we do, allowing our competitors to derive greater net sales and profits from their existing customer base, acquire customers at lower costs or respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in consumer preferences or habits. Our competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies (including but not limited to predatory pricing policies and the provision of substantial discounts), allowing them to build larger customer bases or generate gross profit from their customer bases more effectively than we do. Current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others. If we fail to compete effectively, or are required to offer promotions and other incentives or adopt more aggressive pricing strategies, our operating margins could decrease, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
48 Risks Related to Information Technology and Cybersecurity We are subject to risks related to online payment methods.
We currently accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, PayPal and gift cards. As we offer new payment options to subscribers, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements, fraud and other risks. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Furthermore, as our business changes, we may be subject to different rules under existing standards, which may require new assessments that involve costs above what we currently pay for compliance. In the future, as we offer new payment options to subscribers, including by way of integrating emerging mobile and other payment methods, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud. If we fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept, if the volume of fraud in our transactions limits or terminates our rights to use payment methods we currently accept, or if a data breach occurs relating to our payment systems, we may, among other things, be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose, or face restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit card payments from subscribers or facilitate other types of online payments. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
We rely on software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) technologies from third parties.
We rely on SaaS technologies from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including financial management services, credit card processing, customer relationship management services, supply chain services and data storage services. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or prices, or for any other reason, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage our finances could be interrupted, our processes for managing sales of our offerings and supporting our customers could be impaired, our ability to communicate with our suppliers could be weakened and our ability to access or save data stored to the cloud may be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained and implemented. We are also subject to certain standard terms and conditions with these providers, who have broad discretion to change their terms of service and other policies with respect to us, which may be unfavorable. Any failure to maintain successful partnerships with our SaaS providers could impact our success and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Limitations on our use of “cookies” may impact our ability to cost-effectively acquire new customers. Federal and state governmental authorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use of third-party “cookies” and other methods of online tracking for behavioral advertising and other purposes. The U.S. government has enacted, or has considered or is considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to engage in these activities, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools or the use of data gathered with such tools. Additionally, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented, or announced plans to implement, means to make it easier for Internet users to prevent the placement of cookies or to block other tracking technologies, which if widely adopted could result in making cookies and other methods of online tracking significantly less effective. This regulation of the use of these cookies and other current online tracking and advertising practices or the loss of our ability to make effective use of services that employ such technologies could limit our ability to acquire new customers on cost-effective terms, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We may be unable to maintain and scale our technology.
Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain and serve our customers depends on the reliable performance of our website and mobile application and our underlying network infrastructure. As our subscriber and customer base and the amount of information shared on our website and mobile application continue to grow, we will need an increasing amount of network capacity and computing power. The operation of these systems is complex and could result in operational failures. Interruptions or delays in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, undetected errors, design faults or other unexpected events or causes, could affect the security or availability of our website and mobile application and prevent our customers from accessing our website and mobile application. If sustained or repeated, these performance issues could reduce the
49 attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, the costs and complexities involved in expanding and upgrading our systems may prevent us from doing so in a timely manner and may prevent us from adequately meeting the demand placed on our systems. Any web or mobile platform interruption or inadequacy that causes performance issues or interruptions in the availability of our website or mobile application could reduce consumer satisfaction and result in a reduction in the number of customers using our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our disaster recovery arrangements may be insufficient. The occurrence of a natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, data loss, computer virus, an act of terrorism, cyberattack, vandalism or sabotage, act of war or any similar event, or a decision to close the third-party data centers on which we normally operate or the facilities of any other third-party provider without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our website and mobile application. Cloud computing, in particular, is dependent upon having access to an Internet connection in order to retrieve data. If a natural disaster, pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), blackout or other unforeseen event were to occur that disrupted our ability to obtain an Internet connection, we may experience a slowdown or delay in our operations. While we have some limited disaster recovery arrangements in place, our preparations may not be adequate to account for disasters or similar events that may occur in the future and may not effectively permit us to continue operating in the event of any problems with respect to our systems or those of our third-party data centers or any other third-party facilities. Our disaster recovery and data redundancy plans may be inadequate, and our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for the losses that could occur. If any such event were to occur to our business, our operations could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The security of our and our partners’ computer networks and databases containing personal information may be compromised. In the ordinary course of business, we and our vendors collect, process, and store certain personal information and other data relating to individuals, such as our subscribers, customers and employees, including subscriber and customer payment card information. We rely substantially on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for our processing, transmission, and storage of personal information and other confidential information. We, or our vendors, may suffer a data compromise from hackers or other unauthorized parties who gain access to personal information or other data, including payment card data or confidential business information, which may not be discovered in a timely fashion. In addition, cyber-attacks such as ransomware attacks could lock us out of our information systems and disrupt our operations. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, and we, and our vendors, may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. As our business partners have moved to remote work in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, they may be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In addition, our vendors, or other third parties with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to misappropriate personal information, confidential information, or other data, or may inadvertently release or compromise such data. Compromise of our data security by third parties with whom we do business, failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business information, and delays in detecting or providing prompt notice of any such compromise or loss may disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and subject us to litigation, government action, or other additional costs and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.
We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, agreements and other methods with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country and the protection of our intellectual property rights may require significant financial, managerial and operational expenditures. In addition, our efforts may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property rights and any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation. Our patent and trademark applications may never be granted and the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming. We may be unable to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Even if issued,
50 these patents may not adequately protect our intellectual property, as the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of patent protection are uncertain. In addition, others may independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology. Our confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information, technologies and processes and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information. We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may be unable to discover or determine the extent of any infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights or costs associated with such protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other allegations. Third parties have from time to time claimed, and may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. These claims, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in considerable litigation costs, injunctions against us or the payment of damages or royalties by us, require significant amounts of management time or divert significant operational resources or cause expensive changes to our business model. In addition, we may be unable to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. Any payments we are required to make and any injunctions against us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Risks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings We are subject to federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, advertising and consumer protection.
We rely on a variety of marketing techniques, including email and social media marketing and postal mailings, which are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. A variety of federal and state laws and regulations also govern our collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data, particularly in the context of the online advertising that we rely on to attract new customers. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations, in particular from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with other laws and regulations. In addition, various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations, may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection, consumer protection, and advertising. For example, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to customers about the collection of their data, use and sharing practices, and allow customers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provide a new cause of action for data breaches. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) significantly amends the CCPA and imposes additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California Privacy Protection Agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which could result in increased regulatory scrutiny of businesses in the areas of data protection and security. Similar laws have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, and if passed, such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that could make compliance challenging. Our practices and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations may not always be effective, particularly as the legal landscape continues to evolve. In addition, some of our internal processes are manual, which could result in employee error and internal compliance failures. Any failure, or perceived failure, to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any federal or state privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection could adversely affect our reputation, brand and business, and may result in claims, liabilities, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, subscribers, customers, suppliers or others, or may require us to change our operations and/or cease using certain data. Any such claims, proceedings or actions could further harm our reputation and brand, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings or actions, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of subscribers, customers and suppliers and result in the imposition of monetary penalties. We may also be contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of our non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection or any inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of
51 operating our business. Any harm to our reputation or brand, being subject of regulatory action and incurring related fees, distraction of our management and loss of customers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to product safety, labor, or other laws.
The products we sell to our customers are subject to regulation by the Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and similar state and international regulatory authorities. As such, our products could be subject to recalls and other remedial actions. Product safety, labeling, and licensing concerns may result in our voluntarily removing selected products from our inventory. Recalls or voluntary removal of products can result in, among other things, lost sales, diverted resources, potential harm to our reputation, increased customer service costs and legal expenses. In addition, some of the merchandise we sell may expose us to product liability claims, litigation or regulatory actions. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors may not indemnify us from product liability for a particular vendor’s merchandise or our vendors may not have sufficient resources or insurance to satisfy their indemnity and defense obligations. In addition, failure of our vendors to comply with applicable laws and regulations and contractual requirements could lead to litigation against us, resulting in increased legal expenses. Furthermore, the failure of any vendors to provide safe and humane factory conditions at their facilities could damage our reputation with our customers and result in legal claims against us. Our international relationships also require us to overcome logistical and other challenges based on differing languages, cultures, legal and regulatory schemes and time zones. Foreign labor laws, standards and customs may vary greatly from those in the U.S. The U.S. or foreign countries could enact legislation or impose regulations, including unfavorable labor regulations, tax policies or economic sanctions that could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business in the countries in which we have relationships. The difficulties inherent in complying with labor, safety and other laws, or consequences resulting from any failure to comply with those laws could result in increased costs, disruptions in our relationships with our vendors, and harm to our brand and reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to extensive governmental regulation.
We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public and worker health and safety, natural resources and the environment. Our operations, including our manufacturing partners, are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture and by various other federal, state, local and foreign authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and export of our products, including food safety standards. In addition, we and our manufacturing partners are subject to additional regulatory requirements, including environmental, health and safety laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety legislative and regulatory authorities and the National Labor Relations Board, covering such areas as discharges and emissions to air and water, the use, management, disposal and remediation of, and human exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes, and public and worker health and safety. Violations of, or liability under, any of these laws and regulations may result in administrative, civil or criminal fines, penalties or sanctions against us, revocation or modification of applicable permits, licenses or authorizations, environmental, health and safety investigations or remedial activities, voluntary or involuntary product recalls, warning or untitled letters or cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance, among other things. Such laws and regulations generally have become more stringent over time and may become more so in the future, and we may incur (directly, or indirectly through our manufacturing partners) material costs to comply with current or future laws and regulations or in any required product recalls. Complying with the current laws and regulations, and potential future changes to these laws and regulations, or failing to comply with these laws and regulations, could impose significant limitations and/or require changes to our business, which may involve substantial expenses, make our business more costly and less efficient to conduct, and compromise our growth strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, rules or regulations. Existing tax laws, rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by tax authorities or amendment, repeal, or new enactments. For example, the 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. required us
52 to collect sales tax in many jurisdictions despite our lack of a physical presence in such jurisdictions. Also, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may limit our ability to use our substantial net operating losses to offset potential future taxable income, which is further dependent upon by our ability to generate taxable income before the expiration dates of the net operating losses, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, we will generate sufficient taxable income to use all of our net operating losses. We are currently monitoring changes in the tax landscape, however, it is difficult to predict whether such changes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Lawsuits and other administrative, regulatory, or legal proceedings that may arise in the course of our operations can involve substantial costs, including the costs associated with investigation, litigation and possible settlement, judgment, penalty or fine. In addition, the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations and companies have experienced fluctuations in their stock prices that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to their operating results. Under these circumstances, stockholders may sometimes institute securities class action litigation against such companies. Any litigation or other administrative, regulatory, or legal proceedings against us could result in substantial costs, and divert management’s attention and resources. Although we generally maintain insurance to mitigate certain costs, there can be no assurance that costs associated with lawsuits or other legal proceedings will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies. Moreover, we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all, or to secure additional coverage, which may result in costs associated with lawsuits and other legal proceedings being uninsured. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if fees associated with lawsuits or other legal proceedings or a judgment, penalty or fine is not fully or is only partially covered by insurance.
General Risk Related to Our Business We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
In the course of preparing our financial statements for fiscal year 2022, our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses include: (i) the insufficient review of
account reconciliations for certain account balances; (ii) the lack of formalized processes and controls around inventory management; (iii) the improper accounting for the review of complex or non-routine transactions; and (iv) the lack of effective internal controls around change management and those internal controls that would restrict access to financial systems to appropriate users and ensure that appropriate segregation of duties is maintained. Specifically, certain change management controls were not adhered to, and certain personnel had access to financial applications, programs and data beyond that needed to perform their individual job responsibilities and without independent monitoring. In addition, certain financial personnel had incompatible duties which allowed for the creation, review and processing of certain financial data without independent review and authorization. The material weakness set forth in this (iv) affects substantially all financial statement accounts. We will not be able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until the appropriate steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time, see “Item 4 - Controls and Procedures.”
Further weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Failing to develop or maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, may result in a misstatement of our financial statements or cause investors to lose confidence in us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies could prove to be incorrect.
We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires our management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity as of the date of the financial statements, and the amount of revenue
53 and expenses, during the periods presented, that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to determination of fair value of our inventory reserves, common stock and warrants, stock-based compensation and the valuation of embedded derivatives. If our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, our operating results could fall below the expectations of industry or financial analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.
We may be unable to accurately forecast our revenue and appropriately plan for our expenses in the future.
Revenue is difficult to forecast with certainty because it depends on a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including the volume, timing, and type of orders we receive and increased third party costs or transportation and freight costs. Many of these factors are uncertain and are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. We base our expense levels and investment plans on our estimates of revenues and gross margins, and many of our expenses, such as office leases, manufacturing costs and personnel costs, will be relatively fixed in the short term and will increase as we continue to make investments in our business and hire additional personnel. If our revenue forecasts do not cover our planned operating expenses, our business and future operating results will be materially adversely affected.
The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management’s attention.
We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any rules promulgated thereunder, as well as the rules of New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). The requirements of these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight are required, and, as a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns. Additionally, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. We may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. The increased costs of compliance with public company reporting requirements and our potential failure to satisfy these requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Certain of our key performance indicators are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies.
We track certain key performance indicators, including metrics such as active subscriptions, average monthly subscription churn, new subscriptions and customer acquisition costs, with internal systems and tools. Estimates or similar metrics published by third parties may differ from our reported key performance indications, due to differences in sources, methodologies, or assumptions. For example, we rely on third-party marketing analytics systems to identify marketing spend by channel, which we then reconcile across a number of systems. In addition, we rely on third-party warehouse and fulfillment providers to communicate the receiving and shipping information that drives active customer count and related data. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our key performance indicators, including the metrics or estimates that we publicly disclose. While these metrics or estimates are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring our key performance indicators. Some of these challenges include manual reconciliation of information provided by different input systems, resulting in undetected errors. If our key performance indicators are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not perceive our key performance indicators to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these numbers, our reputation may be significantly harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have a history of losses and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.
We expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we increase our advertising, expand into new markets, expand our offerings, hire additional personnel, incur additional expenses related to being a public company and continue to develop features on our website and mobile applications. In particular, we intend to continue to invest substantial resources to grow and diversify our product offerings and in marketing to acquire new customers. Our operating expenses may also be adversely impacted by increased costs and delays in launching in
54 new markets and expanding fulfillment center capacity, in particular as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other macro-economic conditions. Our future growth and operating performance must eventually offset our operating losses or we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.
We may fail to manage or integrate acquisitions of, or investments in, new or complementary businesses, facilities, technologies or products, or through strategic alliances.
From time to time, we may consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in complementary businesses, facilities, technologies, offerings, or products, or enter into strategic alliances, in order to enhance our capabilities, expand our outsourcing and supplier network, complement our current products or expand the breadth of our offerings. Acquisitions, investments and other strategic alliances involve numerous risks, including: problems integrating the acquired business, facilities, technologies, subscribers, customers, partners or products, issues maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies; unanticipated costs; diversion of management’s attention from our existing business; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, manufacturing partners, and retail partners; challenges with entering new markets in which we may have limited or no experience; potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses; and increased legal, accounting and compliance costs. Failure to integrate acquired businesses, facilities, technologies and products effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our operating flexibility may be limited by our credit facilities and debt instruments.
Our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 2025 Convertible Notes both limit our ability to, among other things:
incur or guarantee additional debt; make certain investments and acquisitions; incur certain liens or permit them to exist; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; merge or consolidate with another company; and transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including our cash. In addition, if our stock price does not meet the conversion price of the 2025 Convertible Notes, then we will have to repay the principal of the 2025 Convertible Notes in cash, which we may not have available. Our revolving credit facility also contains covenants requiring us to satisfy certain financial covenants. These limitations, requirements and costs may affect our ability to obtain future financing, pursue attractive business opportunities, maintain flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We may not be able to raise the capital we need to grow our business.
In the future, we could be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business. We may sell common stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions, investors in our common stock may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our operational flexibility or profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may be forced to raise funds on undesirable terms, or our business may contract or we may be unable to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock
A recent decision of the Delaware Court of Chancery may create uncertainty regarding the validity of some of our authorized and issued shares of common stock. On February 7, 2023, we filed a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery pursuant to Section 205 ("Section 205") of the Delaware General Corporation Law, seeking validation of an amendment to our certificate of incorporation (the "Amendment"), undertaken at a special meeting of our stockholders held on May 28, 2021, which increased our authorized common stock by a majority vote of the then-outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, voting as a single class. A recent decision of the Delaware Court of Chancery may create uncertainty regarding the validity of this Amendment. While we believe that a separate vote of Class A common stock was not required to approve the Amendment, and therefore that all of our currently outstanding shares of common stock are validly authorized and issued, if we are not successful in the Section 205 proceeding, this uncertainty could continue, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. 55 Our stock price may be volatile or decline regardless of our operating performance.
The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly or decline in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations; financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections; failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of BARK, changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow BARK or our failure to meet the estimates or the expectations of investors; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other retail or technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular; price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole; trading volume of our common stock; the inclusion, exclusion or removal of our common stock from any indices; changes in members of our Board or management; transactions in our common stock by directors, officers, affiliates and other major investors; lawsuits threatened or filed against us; changes in laws or regulations applicable to our business; changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities; short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock; general economic conditions in the U.S. or global markets; other events or factors, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; war, such as in the war in the Ukraine; incidents of terrorism or responses to these events; and the other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section.
An active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.
Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “BARK.” An active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. Accordingly, there may not be a liquid trading market in which to sell your shares of our common stock when desired or at acceptable prices.
Sales of shares by existing stockholders may cause our stock price to decline.
If our existing stockholders sell or indicate an intention to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. In addition, shares underlying any outstanding options and restricted stock units will become eligible for sale if exercised or settled, as applicable, and to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements and Rule 144 of the Securities Act. All the shares of common stock subject to stock options outstanding and reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans have been registered on Form S-8 under the Securities Act and such shares are eligible for sale in the public markets, subject to Rule 144 limitations applicable to affiliates. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
Securities or industry analysts may not publish accurate or favorable research about BARK.
The trading market for our common stock is influenced in part by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts initiate research with an unfavorable rating or downgrade our common stock, provide a more favorable recommendation about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock could decline.
Our certificate of incorporation may prevent us from receiving the benefit of certain corporate opportunities.
The “corporate opportunity” doctrine provides that corporate fiduciaries, as part of their duty of loyalty to the corporation and its stockholders, may not take for themselves an opportunity that in fairness should belong to the corporation. Section 122(17) of the DGCL, however, expressly permits a Delaware corporation to renounce in its certificate of incorporation any interest or expectancy of the corporation in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, specified business opportunities or specified classes or categories of business opportunities that are presented to the corporation or its officers, directors or stockholders. Article THIRTEENTH of our certificate of incorporation provides that doctrine of corporate opportunity shall not apply with respect to us or any of our officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates. As a result, we may be not be offered certain corporate opportunities which could be beneficial to our company and our stockholders. While it is difficult at this time to predict how this provision may adversely impact our stockholders, it is possible that we could not be offered the opportunity to participate in a future transaction that might have resulted in a financial benefit to us, which could, in turn, result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.
Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may impede a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest.
56 Our certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by impeding a change in control of BARK or changes in our management that our stockholders may deem advantageous. These provisions include: a classified board; removal of directors only for cause or a super majority vote; super majority vote required to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and any provisions of our bylaws; issuance of “blank check” preferred stock authorized; stockholders may not call special stockholder meetings; stockholder action by written consent prohibited; indemnification of our director and officers; Board is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws; and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.
Substantially all disputes between BARK and our stockholders are subject to exclusive forum provisions. Our certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. This choice of forum provision does not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for any actions brought under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Accordingly, our exclusive forum provision will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Moreover, the terms of our revolving credit facility may restrict our ability to pay dividends, and any additional debt we may incur in the future may include similar restrictions. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.
Ownership of our stock is concentrated among our current officers, directors and their respective affiliates.
Our existing executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates, together as a group, beneficially own a significant amount of the outstanding of our common stock. This group, if it acts together, could have the ability to influence matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. As a result, this group could, for example, delay or prevent a change in control of BARK and the approval of certain transactions. We may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities, which would dilute your ownership interests and could depress the market price of our common stock.
We currently have options, RSUs and warrants outstanding that are convertible into shares of our common stock. In addition, our 2025 Convertible Notes are convertible based on outstanding principal balance and accrued interest. We also have the ability to issue equity awards that are convertible into shares of our common stock under our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan and under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, see Note 5, “Debt”, and Note 6, “Stock-Based Compensation Plans”, to our condensed consolidated financial statements set forth in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank in the future in connection with, among other things, future acquisitions or repayment of outstanding indebtedness, without stockholder approval, in a number of circumstances. Our issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank would dilute our existing shareholders and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Risks Related to the 2025 Convertible Notes
Our obligation to redeem the 2025 Convertible Notes may not protect holders.
Our obligation to offer to redeem the 2025 Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change will be triggered only by certain specified transactions.
The term “fundamental change” is limited to certain specified
57 transactions and may not include other events that might adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of the 2025 Convertible Notes or our common stock. Our obligation to offer to redeem the new notes upon a fundamental change would not necessarily afford holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, merger or similar transaction involving us.
There is no existing public trading market for the 2025 Convertible Notes.
No market for the 2025 Convertible Notes exists and may not develop. Even if a market develops, it may not persist. We do not intend to apply for listing of the 2025 Convertible Notes on any securities exchange or other market. The liquidity of any trading market and the trading price of the 2025 Convertible Notes may be adversely affected by changes in our financial performance or prospects and by changes in the financial performance of or prospects for companies in our industry generally.
