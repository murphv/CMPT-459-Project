STAR GROUP, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED F INANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
1) Organization
Star Group, L.P. (“Star,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a full service provider specializing in the sale of home heating and air conditioning products and services to residential and commercial home heating oil and propane customers. The Company has
one
reportable segment for accounting purposes.
We also sell diesel fuel, gasoline and home heating oil on a delivery only basis. We believe we are the nation’s largest retail distributor of home heating oil based upon sales volume.
The Company is organized as follows:
• Star is a limited partnership, which at December 31, 2022, had outstanding
35.7
million Common Units (NYSE: “SGU”), representing a
99.1 % limited partner interest in Star, and
0.3
million general partner units, representing a
0.9 % general partner interest in Star.
Our general partner is Kestrel Heat, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Kestrel Heat” or the “general partner”). The Board of Directors of Kestrel Heat (the “Board”) is appointed by its sole member, Kestrel Energy Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Kestrel”).
Although Star is a partnership, it is taxed as a corporation and its distributions to unitholders are treated as taxable dividends. • Star owns
100 % of Star Acquisitions, Inc. (“SA”), a Minnesota corporation that owns
100 % of Petro Holdings, Inc. (“Petro”). SA and its subsidiaries are subject to Federal and state corporate income taxes. Star’s operations are conducted through Petro and its subsidiaries. Petro is primarily a Northeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. region retail distributor of home heating oil and propane that at December 31, 2022 served approximately
421,000
full service residential and commercial home heating oil and propane customers and
76,400
customers on a delivery only basis. We also sell gasoline and diesel fuel to approximately
26,900
customers. We install, maintain, and repair heating and air conditioning equipment and to a lesser extent provide these services outside our heating oil and propane customer base including approximately
20,000
service contracts for natural gas and other heating systems. • Petroleum Heat and Power Co., Inc. (“PH&P”) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Star. PH&P is the borrower and Star is the guarantor of the sixth amended and restated credit agreement’s $ 165
million
five-year
senior secured term loan and the $ 400
million ($ 550
million during the heating season of December through April of each year) revolving credit facility, both due
July 6, 2027 . (See Note 11—Long-Term Debt and Bank Facility Borrowings).
2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Star and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany items and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The financial information included herein is unaudited; however, such information reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments), which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair statement of financial condition and results for the interim periods. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company’s business, the results of operations and cash flows for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.
These interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022.
Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is comprised of Net income and Other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income consists of the unrealized gain on amortization on the Company’s pension plan obligation for its two frozen defined benefit pension plans, unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale investments, unrealized gain (loss) on interest rate hedges and the corresponding tax effects. 8
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months
or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2022, the $ 22.8
million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is composed of $ 22.6
million of cash and cash equivalents and $ 0.3
million of restricted cash. At September 30, 2022, the $ 14.9
million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is composed of $ 14.6
million of cash and cash equivalents and $ 0.3
million of restricted cash. Restricted cash represents deposits held by our captive insurance company that are required by state insurance regulations to remain in the captive insurance company as cash.
Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale at September 30, 2022 represent certain heating oil assets that the Company sold on October 25, 2022.
The carrying amount of the assets held for sale included $ 2.2
million of goodwill and $ 0.8
million of property and equipment, net.
We measure and record assets held for sale at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
The carrying amounts of the assets held for sale approximated their fair value at September 30, 2022. Fair Value Valuation Approach The Company uses valuation approaches that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:
• Level 1 inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.
• Level 2 inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
• Level 3 inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date. Captive Insurance Collateral
The captive insurance collateral is held by our captive insurance company in an irrevocable trust as collateral for certain workers’ compensation and automobile liability claims.
The collateral is required by a third party insurance carrier that insures per claim amounts above a set deductible. If we did not deposit cash into the trust, the third party carrier would require that we issue an equal amount of letters of credit, which would reduce our availability under the sixth amended and restated credit agreement.
Due to the expected timing of claim payments, the nature of the collateral agreement with the carrier, and our captive insurance company’s source of other operating cash, the collateral is not expected to be used to pay obligations within the next twelve months. Unrealized gains and losses, net of related income taxes, are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except for losses from impairments which are determined to be other-than-temporary. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in the determination of net income and are included in Interest expense, net, at which time the average cost basis of these securities are adjusted to fair value. Weather Hedge Contract
To partially mitigate the adverse effect of warm weather on cash flows, the Company has used weather hedge contracts for a number of years. Weather hedge contracts are recorded in accordance with the intrinsic value method defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 815-45-15 Derivatives and Hedging, Weather Derivatives (EITF 99-2). The premium paid is included in the caption “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” in the accompanying balance sheets and amortized over the life of the contract, with the intrinsic value method applied at each interim period.
9
The Company entered into weather hedge contracts for fiscal year 2023.
The hedge period runs from November 1 through March 31, taken as a whole. The “Payment Thresholds,” or strikes, are set at various levels and are referenced against degree days for the prior ten year average. The maximum amount the Company can receive is $ 12.5
million per year. In addition, we are obligated to make an annual payment capped at $ 5.0
million if degree days exceed the Payment Threshold.
The temperatures experienced during the hedge period through December 31, 2022 were colder than the strikes in the weather hedge contracts. As a result the Company recorded a payable at December 31, 2022 of $ 0.4
million that increased delivery and branch expenses by a corresponding amount, and a receivable of $ 2.2
million at December 31, 2021 that reduced delivery and branch expenses by a corresponding amount. New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund (“the NETTI Fund”) Liability
As of December 31, 2022, we had $ 0.3
million and $ 16.2
million balances included in the captions “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities,” on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet representing the remaining balance of the NETTI Fund withdrawal liability.
As of September 30, 2022, we had $ 0.3
million and $ 16.2
million balances reflected in these categories respectively. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for long-term financing of a similar maturity, the fair value of the NETTI Fund withdrawal liability as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 was $ 20.0
million and $ 20.2
million, respectively. We utilized Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques to determine the fair value of this liability. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The Company adopted the ASU effective December 31, 2022.
The update extends the sunset of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The guidance provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease potential accounting impacts associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued, such as interbank offered rates and LIBOR. The Company has $ 52.8
million of interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2022 that are benchmarked against LIBOR, which the Company has designated as cash flow hedging derivatives.
This guidance includes practical expedients for contract modifications due to reference rate reform. The Company has elected to adopt the practical expedient that the Company may change the contractual terms of the interest rate swap agreements that are expected to be affected by reference rate reform and not be required to de-designate the hedging relationships.
The adoption did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires accounting for contract assets and liabilities from contracts with customers in a business combination to be accounted for in accordance with ASC No. 606.
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022.
The Company has not determined the timing of adoption, but does not expect ASU 2021-08 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Deferred Contract Costs
We recognize an asset for incremental commission expenses paid to sales personnel in conjunction with obtaining new residential customer product and equipment maintenance service contracts. We defer these costs only when we have determined the commissions are, in fact, incremental and would not have been incurred absent the customer contract. Costs to obtain a contract are amortized and recorded ratably as delivery and branch expenses over the period representing the transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate.
Costs to obtain new residential product and equipment maintenance service contracts are amortized as expense over the estimated customer relationship period of approximately
five years .
Deferred contract costs are classified as current or non-current within “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and “Deferred charges and other assets, net,” respectively.
At December 31, 2022, the amount of deferred contract costs included in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and “Deferred charges and other assets, net” was $ 3.5
million and $ 6.4
million, respectively.
At September 30, 2022, the amount of deferred contract costs included in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and “Deferred charges and other assets, net” was $ 3.4
million and $ 5.6
million, respectively.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 we recognized expense of $ 1.0
million
associated with the amortization of deferred contract costs within “Delivery and branch expenses” in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Contract Liability Balances The Company has contract liabilities for advanced payments received from customers for future oil deliveries (primarily amounts received from customers on “smart pay” budget payment plans in advance of oil deliveries) and obligations to service customers with equipment maintenance service contracts.
Contract liabilities are recognized straight-line over the service contract period, generally
one year
or less.
As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 the Company had contract liabilities of $ 149.1
million and $ 152.1
million, respectively.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $ 85.6
million of revenue that was included in the September 30, 2022 contract liability balance.
During the three months ended December 31, 2021 the Company recognized $ 73.0
million of revenue that was included in the September 30, 2021 contract liability balance. Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivables from customers are recorded at the invoiced amounts. Finance charges may be applied to trade receivables that are more than 30 days past due, and are recorded as finance charge income. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s estimate of the amount of trade receivables that may not be collectible. The allowance is determined at an aggregate level by grouping accounts based on certain account criteria and its receivable aging. The allowance is based on both quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience, historical collection patterns, overdue status, aging trends, current and future economic conditions. The Company has an established process to periodically review current and past due trade receivable balances to determine the adequacy of the allowance. No single statistic or measurement determines the adequacy of the allowance. The total allowance reflects management’s estimate of losses inherent in its trade receivables at the balance sheet date. Different assumptions or changes in economic conditions could result in material changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are as follows:

4) Common Unit Repurchase and Retirement
In July 2012, the Board adopted a plan to repurchase certain of the Company’s Common Units (the “Repurchase Plan”). Through August 2022, the Company had repurchased approximately
19.9
million Common Units under the Repurchase Plan. In August 2022, the Board authorized an increase of the number of Common Units that remained available for the Company to repurchase from
0.4
million to a total of
1.7
million, of which,
1.4
million were available for repurchase in open market transactions and
0.3
million were available for repurchase in privately-negotiated transactions. There is no guarantee of the number of units that will be purchased under the Repurchase Plan and the Company may discontinue purchases at any time. The Repurchase Plan does not have a time limit. The Board may also approve additional purchases of units from time to time in private transactions. The Company’s repurchase activities take into account SEC safe harbor rules and guidance for issuer repurchases. All of the Common Units purchased under the Repurchase Plan will be retired.
11
Under the Company’s sixth amended and restated credit agreement dated July 6, 2022, in order to pay distributions and repurchase Common Units, we must maintain Availability (as defined in the sixth amended and restated credit agreement) of $ 60
million,
15.0 % of the facility size of $ 400
million (assuming no borrowings under the seasonal advance) on a historical pro forma and forward-looking basis, and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than
1.15
measured as of the date of repurchase or distribution.

6) Derivatives and Hedging—Disclosures and Fair Value Measurements
The Company uses derivative instruments such as futures, options and swap agreements in order to mitigate exposure to market risk associated with the purchase of home heating oil for price-protected customers, physical inventory on hand, inventory in transit, priced purchase commitments and internal fuel usage. FASB ASC 815-10-05 Derivatives and Hedging, established accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities, along with qualitative disclosures regarding the derivative activity. The Company has elected not to designate its commodity derivative instruments as hedging derivatives, but rather as economic hedges whose change in fair value is recognized in its statement of operations in the caption “(Increase) decrease in the fair value of derivative instruments.” Depending on the risk being economically hedged, realized gains and losses are recorded in cost of product, cost of installations and services, or delivery and branch expenses. As of December 31, 2022, to hedge a substantial majority of the purchase price associated with heating oil gallons anticipated to be sold to its price-protected customers, the Company held the following derivative instruments that settle in future months to match anticipated sales:
9.4
million gallons of swap contracts,
23.2
million gallons of call options,
4.3
million gallons of put options, and
61.3
million net gallons of synthetic call options. To hedge its physical inventory on hand, inventory in transit and basis risk, the Company, as of December 31, 2022, held
25.3
million gallons of swap contracts and
7.3
million gallons of short future contracts that settle in future months.
To hedge its internal fuel usage and other activities for fiscal 2023, the Company held
3.7
million gallons of swap contracts that settle in future months.
As of December 31, 2021, to hedge a substantial majority of the purchase price associated with heating oil gallons anticipated to be sold to its price-protected customers, the Company held the following derivative instruments that settle in future months to match anticipated sales:
14.8
million gallons of swap contracts,
34.6
million gallons of call options,
4.5
million gallons of put options, and
52.6
million net gallons of synthetic call options. To hedge the inter-month differentials for its price-protected customers, its physical inventory on hand and inventory in transit, the Company, as of December 31, 2021, held
1.1
million gallons of long future contracts and
26.7
million gallons of short future contracts that settle in future months.
To hedge its internal fuel usage and other activities for fiscal 2022, the Company held
5.0
million gallons of call options and swap contracts that settle in future months.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has interest rate swap agreements in order to mitigate exposure to market risk associated with variable rate interest on $ 86.9
million, or
53 %, of its long term debt.
The Company has designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedging derivatives.
To the extent these derivative instruments are effective and the accounting standard’s documentation requirements have been met, changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings.
As of December 31, 2022 the fair value of the swap contracts was $ 1.7
million. As of September 30, 2022, the notional value of the swap contracts was $ 54.0
million and the fair value of the swap contracts was $ 2.0
million. We utilized Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques to determine the fair value of the swap contracts. The Company’s derivative instruments are with the following counterparties: Bank of America, N.A., Bank of Montreal, Cargill, Inc., Citibank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Key Bank, N.A., Toronto-Dominion Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The Company assesses counterparty credit risk and considers it to be low. We maintain master netting arrangements that allow for the non-conditional offsetting of amounts receivable and payable with counterparties to help manage our risks and record derivative positions on a net basis. The Company generally does not receive cash collateral from its counterparties and does not restrict the use of cash collateral it maintains at counterparties. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate cash posted as collateral in the normal course of business at counterparties was $ 2.2
million and recorded in “Prepaid expense and other current assets.” Positions with counterparties who are also parties to our credit agreement are collateralized under that facility. As of December 31, 2022, $ 3.3
hedge positions or payable amounts were secured under the credit facility.
The Company’s Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities represent the fair value of commodity contracts used in its hedging activities that are identical and traded in active markets. The Company’s Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities represent the fair value of commodity and interest rate contracts used in its hedging activities that are valued using either directly or indirectly observable inputs, whose nature, risk and class are similar. No significant transfers of assets or liabilities have been made into and out of the Level 1 or Level 2 tiers. All derivative instruments were non-trading positions and were either a Level 1 or Level 2 instrument. The Company had no Level 3 derivative instruments. The fair market value of our Level 1 and Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities are calculated by our counter-parties and are independently validated by the Company. The Company’s calculations are, for Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities, based on the published New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) market prices for the commodity contracts open at the end of the period. For Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities the calculations performed by the Company are based on a combination of the NYMEX published market prices and other inputs, including such factors as present value, volatility and duration.

The Company had no assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition.

On July 6, 2022, the Company refinanced its
five-year
term loan and the revolving credit facility with the execution of the sixth amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement (the “credit agreement”) with a bank syndicate comprised of ten participants, which enables the Company to borrow up to $ 400
million ($ 550
million during the heating season of December through April of each year) on a revolving credit facility for working capital purposes (subject to certain borrowing base limitations and coverage ratios), provides for a $ 165
million five-year senior secured term loan (“Term Loan”), allows for the issuance of up to $ 25
million in letters of credit, and has a maturity date of
July 6, 2027 .
The Company can increase the revolving credit facility size by an additional $ 200
million without the consent of the bank group. However, the bank group is not obligated to fund the $ 200
million increase. If the bank group elects not to fund the increase, the Company can add additional lenders to the group, with the consent of the Agent (as defined in the credit agreement), which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by the Company and its subsidiaries and are secured by liens on substantially all of the Company’s assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles, real property, fixtures and equipment.
All amounts outstanding under the sixth amended and restated revolving credit facility become due and payable on the facility termination date of July 6, 2027. The Term Loan is repayable in quarterly payments of $ 4.1
million, the first of which was made December 30, 2022, plus an annual payment equal to
25 % of the annual Excess Cash Flow as defined in the credit agreement (an amount not to exceed $ 8.5
million annually), less certain voluntary prepayments made during the year, with final payment at maturity.
In fiscal 2022 the Company repaid $ 4.9
million of additional loan repayments due to Excess Cash Flow related to fiscal 2021. Under the Company’s sixth amended and restated revolving credit facility, the next annual Excess Cash Flow payment will be applicable for fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The interest rate on the revolving credit facility and the term loan is based on a margin over Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") or a base rate. At December 31, 2022, the effective interest rate on the term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings was approximately
5.9 % and
6.5 %, respectively. At September 30, 2022, the effective interest rate on the term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings was approximately
4.7 % and
2.6 %, respectively. The commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility is
0.30 % from December through April, and
0.20 % from May through November.
The credit agreement requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of not less than

12) Income Taxes
The accompanying financial statements are reported on a fiscal year, however, the Company and its corporate subsidiaries file Federal and State income tax returns on a calendar year.
The current and deferred income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows:

Our continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. We file U.S. Federal income tax returns and various state and local returns. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. For our Federal income tax returns we have
four tax years
subject to examination. In our major state tax jurisdictions of New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, we have
four years
that are subject to examination. In the state tax jurisdiction of New Jersey we have
five tax years
that are subject to examination. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretation of tax law, we believe that our provision for income taxes reflect the most probable outcome. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events.

14) Commitments and Contingencies
The Company’s operations are subject to the operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling, storing and transporting and otherwise providing for use by consumers hazardous liquids such as home heating oil and propane. In the ordinary course of business, the Company is a defendant in various legal proceedings and litigation. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. We do not believe these matters, when considered individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
The Company maintains insurance policies with insurers in amounts and with coverages and deductibles we believe are reasonable and prudent. However, the Company cannot assure that this insurance will be adequate to protect it from all material expenses related to current and potential future claims, legal proceedings and litigation, as certain types of claims may be excluded from our insurance coverage. If we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits, or if we incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Liquid Product Price Volatility
Volatility, which is reflected in the wholesale price of liquid products, including home heating oil, propane and motor fuels, has a larger impact on our business when prices rise. Home heating oil consumers are sensitive to heating cost increases, and this often leads to customer conservation and increased gross customer losses. As a commodity, the price of home heating oil is generally impacted by many factors, including economic and geopolitical forces, and, most recently, the war in the Ukraine, and is closely linked to the price of diesel fuel.
The volatility in the wholesale cost of diesel fuel as measured by the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”), for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2019, through 2023, on a quarterly basis, is illustrated in the following chart (price per gallon):

During the first quarter of fiscal 2023 the wholesale price of home heating oil continued to be extremely volatile. We believe these circumstances were attributable to supply and demand imbalances, exacerbated by the war in the Ukraine.
From time-to-time, the Company (as well as our competition) paid a premium over the NYMEX-published price for product purchased to ensure prompt delivery. The significant increase in product costs resulted in higher operating expenses, such as credit card fees, bad debt expense, and vehicle fuels, and also led to higher working capital requirements, including higher premiums and cash requirements for certain of our hedging instruments. Furthermore, our credit availability (as defined in our Credit Agreement) was reduced as the Company used a portion of its cash flow to finance these higher working capital needs and to satisfy margin requirements on our hedged inventory positions.
The Company's average borrowings increased $86.5 million compared to the prior year, which resulted in an increase in interest expense. The Company believes that it may experience a slowing of collection of our accounts over the next few months as our customers respond to higher product prices, and customers may defer or curtail liquid product purchases in response to the higher product prices.
Income Taxes
Book versus Tax Deductions
The amount of cash flow generated in any given year depends upon a variety of factors including the amount of cash income taxes required, which will increase as depreciation and amortization decreases. The amount of depreciation and amortization that we deduct for book (i.e., financial reporting) purposes will differ from the amount that the Company can deduct for Federal tax purposes. The table below compares the estimated depreciation and amortization for book purposes to the amount that we expect to deduct for Federal tax purposes, based on currently owned assets. While we file our tax returns based on a calendar year, the amounts below are based on our September 30 fiscal year, and the tax amounts include any 100% bonus depreciation available for fixed assets purchased.
However, this table does not include any forecast of future annual capital purchases.

Weather Hedge Contracts
Weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for home heating oil and propane because certain customers depend on these products principally for space heating purposes. Actual weather conditions may vary substantially from year to year, significantly affecting the Company’s financial performance. To partially mitigate the adverse effect of warm weather on cash flow, we have used weather hedging contracts for a number of years with several providers.
Under these contracts, we are entitled to a payment if the total number of degree days within the hedge period is less than the applicable “Payment Thresholds,” or strikes. For fiscal 2023 we entered into weather hedging contracts under which we are entitled to a payment capped at $12.5 million if degree days are less than the Payment Threshold and we are obligated to make an annual payment capped at $5.0 million if degree days exceed the Payment Threshold. The hedge period runs from November 1 through March 31, taken as a whole, for each respective fiscal year.
In accordance with ASC 815-45, we recorded a $0.4 million expense to delivery and branch expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 (reflecting colder temperatures) as compared to a $2.2 million benefit for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 (reflecting warmer temperatures).
The final settlement under these contracts may differ depending on the actual heating degree-days recorded in the period January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2023. Temperatures recorded for January 2023 were warmer than expected.
Per Gallon Gross Profit Margins
We believe home heating oil and propane margins should be evaluated on a cents per gallon basis (before the effects of increases or decreases in the fair value of derivative instruments), as we believe that such per gallon margins are best at showing profit trends in the underlying business, without the impact of non-cash changes in the market value of hedges before the settlement of the underlying transaction.
22
A significant portion of our home heating oil volume is sold to individual customers under an arrangement pre-establishing a ceiling price or fixed price for home heating oil over a set period of time, generally twelve to twenty-four months (“price-protected” customers). When these price-protected customers agree to purchase home heating oil from us for the next heating season, we purchase option contracts, swaps and futures contracts for a substantial majority of the heating oil that we expect to sell to these customers. The amount of home heating oil volume that we hedge per price-protected customer is based upon the estimated fuel consumption per average customer per month. In the event that the actual usage exceeds the amount of the hedged volume on a monthly basis, we may be required to obtain additional volume at unfavorable costs. In addition, should actual usage in any month be less than the hedged volume, our hedging costs and losses could be greater, thus reducing expected margins.
Derivatives
FASB ASC 815-10-05 Derivatives and Hedging requires that derivative instruments be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. To the extent our interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are effective, as defined under this guidance, changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted hedged item is recognized in earnings. We have elected not to designate our commodity derivative instruments as hedging instruments under this guidance and, as a result, the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in our statement of operations. Therefore, we experience volatility in earnings as outstanding derivative instruments are marked to market and non-cash gains and losses are recorded prior to the sale of the commodity to the customer. The volatility in any given period related to unrealized non-cash gains or losses on derivative instruments can be significant to our overall results. However, we ultimately expect those gains and losses to be offset by the cost of product when purchased.
Customer Attrition
We measure net customer attrition on an ongoing basis for our full service residential and commercial home heating oil and propane customers. Net customer attrition is the difference between gross customer losses and customers added through marketing efforts. Customers added through acquisitions are not included in the calculation of gross customer gains. However, additional customers that are obtained through marketing efforts or lost at newly acquired businesses are included in these calculations from the point of closing going forward. Customer attrition percentage calculations include customers added through acquisitions in the denominators of the calculations on a weighted average basis from the closing date. Gross customer losses are the result of a number of factors, including price competition, move-outs, credit losses, conversions to natural gas and service disruptions. When a customer moves out of an existing home, we count the “move out” as a loss, and, if we are successful in signing up the new homeowner, the “move in” is treated as a gain. The impact of certain geopolitical forces, particularly the war in the Ukraine, on liquid product prices could increase future attrition due to higher losses from credit related issues.

For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company gained 7,000 accounts (net), or 1.7% of its home heating oil and propane customer base, compared to 1,300 accounts gained (net), or 0.3% of its home heating and oil propane customer base in the prior year's first quarter.
Gross customer gains were 6,700 more than the prior year's comparable period because we were able to take advantage of certain market conditions with regard to physical supply. Gross customer losses were 1,000 more primarily due to product prices, customer credit cancellations and fuel conversions.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that we lost 0.4% of our home heating oil and propane accounts to natural gas conversions versus 0.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 0.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2020.
Losses to natural gas in our footprint for the heating oil and propane industry could be greater or less than the Company’s estimates.
Acquisitions
The timing of acquisitions and the types of products sold by acquired companies impact year-over-year comparisons.
During fiscal year 2023 through December 31, 2022, the Company acquired two heating oil dealers.
During fiscal 2022 the Company acquired five heating oil dealers.

Protected Price Account Renewals
A substantial majority of the Company’s price-protected customers have agreements with us that are subject to annual renewal in the period between April and November of each fiscal year. If a significant number of these customers elect not to renew their price-protected agreements with us and do not continue as our customers under a variable price-plan, the Company’s near term profitability, liquidity and cash flow will be adversely impacted.
As of January 31, 2023, the wholesale cost of home heating oil as measured by the NYMEX was $3.18 per gallon, approximately $0.42 per gallon higher than at January 31, 2022.
Based on these recent prices, our price-protected customers will be offered renewal contracts at significantly higher prices than last year, which may adversely impact the acceptance rate of these renewals.
24
Seasonality
The Company’s fiscal year ends on September 30. All references to quarters and years, respectively, in this document are to the fiscal quarters and fiscal years unless otherwise noted. The seasonal nature of our business has resulted, on average, during the last five years, in the sale of approximately 30% of the volume of home heating oil and propane in the first fiscal quarter and 50% of the volume in the second fiscal quarter, the peak heating season. Approximately 25% of the volume of motor fuel and other petroleum products is sold in each of the four fiscal quarters.
We generally realize net income during the quarters ending December and March and net losses during the quarters ending June and September. In addition, sales volume typically fluctuates from year to year in response to variations in weather, wholesale energy prices and other factors.
Degree Day
A “degree day” is an industry measurement of temperature designed to evaluate energy demand and consumption. Degree days are based on how far the average daily temperature departs from 65°F. Each degree of temperature above 65°F is counted as one cooling degree day, and each degree of temperature below 65°F is counted as one heating degree day. Degree days are accumulated each day over the course of a year and can be compared to a monthly or a long-term (multi-year) average to see if a month or a year was warmer or cooler than usual. Degree days are officially observed by the National Weather Service.
Every ten years, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”) computes and publishes average meteorological quantities, including the average temperature for the last 30 years by geographical location, and the corresponding degree days. The latest and most widely used data covers the years from 1991 to 2020. Our calculations of “normal” weather are based on these published 30 year averages for heating degree days, weighted by volume for the locations where we have existing operations.
Consolidated Results of Operations
The following is a discussion of the consolidated results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial and operating data and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

Three Months Ended December 31, 2022
Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021
Volume
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, retail volume of home heating oil and propane sold increased by 2.2 million gallons, or 2.5%, to 89.2 million gallons, compared to 87.0 million gallons for the three months ended December 31, 2021. For those locations where we had existing operations during both periods, which we sometimes refer to as the “base business” (i.e., excluding acquisitions), temperatures (measured on a heating degree day basis) for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were 14.9% colder than the three months ended December 31, 2021 but 6.6% warmer than normal, as reported by NOAA. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, net customer attrition for the base business was 2.2%. The impact of fuel conservation, along with any period-to-period differences in delivery scheduling, the timing of accounts added or lost during the fiscal years, equipment efficiency, and other volume variances not otherwise described, are included in the chart below under the heading “Other.”
An analysis of the change in the retail volume of home heating oil and propane, which is based on management’s estimates, sampling, and other mathematical calculations and certain assumptions, is found below:

Volume of motor fuel and other petroleum products sold decreased by 3.7 million gallons, or 9.4%, to 35.6 million gallons for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 39.3 million gallons for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Product Sales
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, product sales increased by $158.6 million, or 38.6%, to $569.9 million, compared to $411.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to an increase in selling prices that was largely attributable to an increase in wholesale product cost of $1.1832 per gallon, or 54.4%.
Installations and Service
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, installation and service revenue increased by $1.3 million, or 1.6%, to $78.3 million, compared to $77.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to an increase in revenue from service contracts.

Cost of Product
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, cost of product increased $144.5 million, or 52.6%, to $419.1 million, compared to $274.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 due to the impact of a $1.1832 per gallon, or 54.4%, increase in wholesale product cost.
Gross Profit — Product
The table below calculates our per gallon margins and reconciles product gross profit for home heating oil and propane and motor fuel and other petroleum products. We believe the change in home heating oil and propane margins should be evaluated before the effects of increases or decreases in the fair value of derivative instruments, as we believe that realized per gallon margins should not include the impact of non-cash changes in the market value of hedges before the settlement of the underlying transaction. On that basis, home heating oil and propane margins for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $0.1005 per gallon, or 7.0%, to $1.5452 per gallon, from $1.4447 per gallon during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Going forward, we cannot assume that per gallon margins realized during the three months ended December 31, 2022 are sustainable especially with the recent increases in heating oil and propane costs. Product sales and cost of product include home heating oil, propane, other petroleum products and liquidated damages billings.

For the three months ended December 31, 2022, total product gross profit was $150.8 million, which was $14.1 million, or 10.4%, higher than the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to an increase in home heating oil and propane volume ($3.2 million), an increase in home heating oil and propane margins ($8.9 million) and an increase in gross profit from other petroleum products ($2.0 million largely due to an increase in per gallon margins).
Cost of Installations and Service
Total installation costs for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $0.1 million or 0.1%, to $26.7 million, compared to $26.8 million of installation costs for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Installation costs as a percentage of installation sales were 81.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 81.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Service expense increased by $2.5 million, or 5.3%, to $49.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, representing 109.5% of service sales, versus $47.3 million, or 107.6% of service sales, for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The colder temperatures drove an increase in service calls and related expense. In addition, a large proportion of our service expenses are incurred under fixed-fee prepaid service contract arrangements, therefore trends in service expenses may not directly correlate to trends in the related revenues.
Gross profit from service decreased by $1.0 million.
We realized a combined gross profit from service and installation of $1.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to a gross profit of $3.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, a $1.3 million decrease.
27
(Increase) Decrease in the Fair Value of Derivative Instruments
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the change in the fair value of derivative instruments resulted in a $17.6 million charge due to a decrease in the market value for unexpired hedges (a $9.6 million charge) and an $8.0 million charge due to the expiration of certain hedged positions.
During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the change in the fair value of derivative instruments resulted in a $13.4 million charge due to a decrease in the market value for unexpired hedges (a $3.3 million charge) and a $10.1 million charge due to the expiration of certain hedged positions.
Delivery and Branch Expenses
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, delivery and branch expense increased $8.9 million, or 10.1%, to $97.9 million, compared to $89.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, reflecting a $5.3 million, or 6.0%, increase in expense within the base business, $2.6 million higher expense recorded from the Company’s weather hedge and additional costs from acquisitions of $1.0 million.
In the base business, a $1.9 million decrease in insurance claims expense was more than offset by a $2.2 million increase in bad debts and credit card fees that was driven by higher sales as a result of higher product cost, and a $1.2 million increase in vehicle fuel expenses due to higher diesel and gasoline costs.
The remaining expense increase in the base business of $3.8 million, or 4.2%, was due to wage, benefit and other expense increases. As of December 31, 2022 we recorded an expense of $0.4 million under our weather hedge program that increased delivery and branch expenses, versus a benefit of $2.2 million as of December 31, 2021. While the 14.9% colder temperatures for the quarter compared to the prior year largely occurred during October 2022, temperatures during the weather hedge period beginning November 1 were also colder than the prior year comparative period, resulting in a weather hedge expense being recorded for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 versus a weather hedge benefit in the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
The final expense or benefit for fiscal 2023 may be lower or higher depending on the accumulation of actual heating degree-days recorded in the period January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2023. At the end of January 2023, the Company expects to record a receivable under its weather hedge contract as temperatures recorded for January 2023 were warmer than expected.
Depreciation and Amortization Expenses
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $0.6 million, or 7.2%, to $7.8 million, compared to $8.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower amortization expense related to intangible assets that fully amortized in the prior fiscal year.
General and Administrative Expenses
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, general and administrative expenses increased by $0.2 million or 2.7%, to $6.9 million, from $6.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to a $0.4 million increase in the Company's frozen pension expense and $0.2 million of other expense increases that were partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in legal and professional expenses.
Finance Charge Income
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, finance charge income increased to $1.3 million from $0.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to higher customer late payment charges.
Interest Expense, Net
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, net interest expense increased by $2.2 million, or 107.7%, to $4.3 million compared to $2.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The year-over-year change was driven by an increase in average borrowings of $86.5 million from $157.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to $244.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and an increase in the weighted average interest rate from 3.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 6.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in average borrowings was largely due to increased financing to fund working capital as a result of increases in accounts receivable and inventory due to the increase in cost of product. To hedge against rising interest rates, the Company utilizes interest rate swaps.
At December 31, 2022, $86.9 million, or 53%, of Star’s long term debt was fixed.
Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, amortization of debt issuance cost increased to $0.3 million from $0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
28
Income Tax Expense
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s income tax expense decreased by $0.3 million to $5.5 million, from $5.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease in the income tax expense was driven by a $1.3 million decline in income before income taxes.
Net Income
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Star’s net income decreased $1.0 million, to $13.5 million, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an unfavorable change in the fair value of derivative instruments of $4.2 million and a $2.2 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 million and a $0.3 million decrease in income tax expense.
Adjusted EBITDA
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Adjusted EBITDA increased by $4.6 million, to $49.1 million, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, as an increase in home heating oil and propane volume of 2.2 million gallons and an increase in per gallon margins more than offset an increase in operating expenses. As of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an expense of $0.4 million under its weather hedge program that increased delivery and branch expenses, versus a benefit of $2.2 million as of December 31, 2021. While the 14.9% colder temperatures for the quarter compared to the prior year largely occurred during October 2022, temperatures during the weather hedge period beginning November 1 were also colder than the prior year comparative period, resulting in a weather hedge expense being recorded for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 versus a weather hedge benefit in the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
The final expense or benefit for fiscal 2023 may be lower or higher depending on the accumulation of actual heating degree-days recorded in the period January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2023. At the end of January 2023, the Company expects to record a receivable under its weather hedge contract as temperatures recorded for January 2023 were warmer than expected.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (as an indicator of operating performance) or as an alternative to cash flow (as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations) but provide additional information for evaluating the Company’s ability to make the Minimum Quarterly Distribution.

(a) EBITDA (Earnings from continuing operations before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings from continuing operations before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, (increase) decrease in the fair value of derivatives, other income (loss), net, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charge, gain or loss on debt redemption, goodwill impairment, and other non-cash and non-operating charges) are non-GAAP financial measures that are used as supplemental financial measures by management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess:
•	our compliance with certain financial covenants included in our debt agreements;
•	our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or historical cost basis;
•	our operating performance and return on invested capital compared to those of other companies in the retail distribution of refined petroleum products, without regard to financing methods and capital structure;
•	our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and to make distributions to our partners; and
•	the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return of alternative investment opportunities.
The method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may not be consistent with that of other companies, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA both have limitations as analytical tools and so should not be viewed in isolation but in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are:
•	EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash used for capital expenditures.
•	Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized often will have to be replaced and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash requirements for such replacements;
•	EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital requirements;
•	EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash necessary to make payments of interest or principal on our indebtedness; and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash required to pay taxes.
30
DISCUSSION OF CASH FLOWS
We use the indirect method to prepare our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but do not result in actual cash receipts or payment during the period.
Operating Activities
Due to the seasonal nature of our business, cash is generally used in operations during the winter (our first and second fiscal quarters) as we require additional working capital to support the high volume of sales during this period, and cash is generally provided by operating activities during the spring and summer (our third and fourth fiscal quarters) when customer payments exceed the cost of deliveries.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, cash used in operating activities increased $26.8 million, to $92.7 million, compared to $65.9 million in cash used in operating activities during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Higher per gallon product costs drove an increase in receivables on a comparable basis (including accounts receivable, customer credit balance accounts and hedging settlement receivables) of $33.3 million.
While accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 were higher by $74.2 million, or 41.5%, than accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021, days’ sales outstanding increased by only 2 days to 36 days at December 31, 2022 compared to 34 days at December 31. 2021.
The higher product cost also drove a $12.3 million increase in cash required to purchase liquid product inventory.
We also paid $5.2 million more in payroll taxes in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 versus the first fiscal quarter of 2022 as the result of deferring payment of certain payroll tax withholdings in first quarter of fiscal 2021 to the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023.
These cash flow changes were partially offset by a $10.0 million decrease in net cash paid for certain hedge positions, a $6.9 million favorable change in accounts payable due to the pricing and timing of inventory purchases, a $6.1 million increase in cash flows from operations and $1.0 million of other net changes in working capital.
Investing Activities
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired two heating oil dealers for an aggregate price of approximately $1.2 million (using $1.2 million in cash).
The gross purchase price was allocated $1.7 million to intangible assets, $0.2 million to goodwill, $0.2 million to fixed assets and reduced by $0.9 million of negative working capital. On October 25, 2022, the Company sold certain assets for cash proceeds of $2.2 million.
Our capital expenditures for the three months ended December 31, 2022 totaled $3.1 million, as we invested in computer hardware and software ($0.1 million), refurbished certain physical plants ($0.3 million), expanded our propane operations ($0.2 million) and made additions to our fleet and other equipment ($2.5 million).
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, $0.2 million of earnings were reinvested into an irrevocable trust established in connection with our captive insurance company. The cash deposited into the trust is shown on our balance sheet as captive insurance collateral and, correspondingly, reduced cash on our balance sheet. We believe that investments into the irrevocable trust lower our letter of credit fees, increase interest income on invested cash balances, and provide us with certain tax advantages attributable to a captive insurance company.
During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company acquired three heating oil dealers for an aggregate price of approximately $4.2 million (using $3.3 million in cash and assuming $0.9 million of liabilities).
The gross purchase price was allocated $2.9 million to intangible assets, $2.1 million to fixed assets and reduced by $0.8 million in working capital credits.
Our capital expenditures for the three months ended December 31, 2021 totaled $3.8 million, as we invested in computer hardware and software ($0.5 million), refurbished certain physical plants ($0.8 million), expanded our propane operations ($1.0 million) and made additions to our fleet and other equipment ($1.5 million)
During the three months ended December 31, 2021, $0.2 million of earnings were reinvested into the irrevocable trust.
Financing Activities
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repaid $4.1 million of our term loan, borrowed $116.3 million under our revolving credit facility, repurchased 0.4 million Common Units for $3.6 million, in connection with our unit repurchase plan, and paid distributions of $5.5 million to our Common Unit holders and $0.3 million to our General Partner unit holders (including $0.3 million of incentive distributions as provided in our Partnership Agreement).
31
During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we repaid $7.9 million of our term loan, borrowed $115.1 million under our revolving credit facility, repurchased 1.1 million Common Units for $11.8 million, in connection with our unit repurchase plan, and paid distributions of $5.5 million to our Common Unit holders and $0.3 million to our General Partner unit holders (including $0.2 million of incentive distributions as provided in our Partnership Agreement).
FINANCING AND SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY
Liquidity and Capital Resources Comparatives
Our primary uses of liquidity are to provide funds for our working capital, capital expenditures, distributions on our units, acquisitions and unit repurchases. Our ability to provide funds for such uses depends on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic, financial, geopolitical and business conditions, especially in light of the war in the Ukraine, weather, the ability to collect current and future accounts receivable, the ability to pass on the full impact of high product costs to customers, the effects of high net customer attrition, conservation, inflation and other factors. Our liquidity was impacted by the volatility in wholesale price of home heating oil and a significant increase in the cost of our product.
The significant increase in product costs resulted in higher operating expenses, such as credit card fees, bad debt expense, vehicle fuels, interest expense and also led to higher hedging costs for certain of our hedging instruments. Our working capital needs increased to fund these higher product costs and the cash required to finance our operating activities. Further, our credit availability (as defined in our Credit Agreement) was reduced as the Company used a portion of its cash flow to finance these higher working capital needs and to satisfy margin requirements on our hedged inventory positions. The Company believes that it may experience a slowing of collection of our accounts receivable over the next few months as our customers respond to higher product prices.
Capital requirements, at least in the near term, are expected to be provided by cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand as of December 31, 2022 ($22.6 million) or a combination thereof. We believe that these cash sources will also be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements in the longer-term. However, if they are not sufficient, we anticipate that working capital will be financed by our revolving credit facility, as discussed below, and from subsequent seasonal reductions in inventory and accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2022, we had accounts receivable of $253.0 million of which $185.2 million is due from residential customers and $67.8 million is due from commercial customers. Our ability to borrow from our bank group is based in part on the aging of these accounts receivable. If these balances do not meet the eligibility tests as defined in our sixth amended and restated credit agreement, our ability to borrow will be reduced and our anticipated cash flow from operating activities will also be reduced. As of December 31, 2022, we had $136.6 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $160.9 million outstanding under our term loan, $5.1 million in letters of credit outstanding and $3.3 million hedge positions were secured under the credit agreement.
Under the terms of the sixth amended and restated credit agreement, we are required to maintain at all times Availability (borrowing base less amounts borrowed and letters of credit issued) of 12.5% of the maximum facility size and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.1. We are also required to maintain a senior secured leverage ratio that cannot be more than 3.0 as of June 30 th
or September 30 th , and no more than 5.5 as of December 31 st
or March 31 st . As of December 31, 2022, Availability, as defined in the sixth amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement, was $188.5 million and we were in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio and senior secured leverage ratio.
Maintenance capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal 2023 are estimated to be approximately $8.0 million to $9.0 million, excluding the capital requirements for leased fleet. In addition, we plan to invest approximately $2.0 million in our propane operations. Distributions for the balance of fiscal 2023, at the current quarterly level of $0.1525 per unit, would result in aggregate payments of approximately $16.3 million to Common Unit holders, $0.9 million to our General Partner (including $0.8 million of incentive distribution as provided for in our Partnership Agreement) and $0.8 million to management pursuant to the management incentive compensation plan which provides for certain members of management to receive incentive distributions that would otherwise be payable to the General Partner. Under the terms of our sixth amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement, our term loan is repayable in quarterly payments of $4.1 million and we expect to pay $12.4 million for the remainder of fiscal 2023.
Further, subject to any additional liquidity issues or concerns resulting from wholesale price volatility, we may repurchase Common Units pursuant to our unit repurchase plan, as amended from time to time, and seek attractive acquisition opportunities within the Availability constraints of our revolving credit facility and funding resources.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
There has been no material change to Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements since our September 30, 2022 Form 10-K disclosure and therefore, the table has not been included in this Form 10-Q.

Recent Accounti ng Pronouncements
Refer to Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently adopted and issued but not yet effective, on our consolidated financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policy and Critical Accounting Estimates
We believe that there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policy and critical accounting estimates during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to those we disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. While our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed in any significant way during the three months ended December 31, 2022, the following provides disclosures about our critical accounting policy and critical accounting estimates.
Critical Accounting Policy
Fair Values of Derivatives
FASB ASC 815-10-05, Derivatives and Hedging, requires that derivative instruments be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The Company has elected not to designate its commodity derivative instruments as hedging instruments under this guidance, and therefore the change in fair value of those derivative instruments are recognized in our statement of operations.
We have established the fair value of our derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated them internally using established index prices and other sources. These values are based upon, among other things, future prices, volatility, time-to-maturity value and credit risk. The estimate of fair value we report in our financial statements changes as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions, or other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Self-Insurance Liabilities
We currently self-insure a portion of workers’ compensation, auto, general liability and medical claims. We establish and periodically evaluate self-insurance liabilities based upon expectations as to what our ultimate liability may be for outstanding claims using developmental factors based upon historical claim experience, including frequency, severity, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions, supplemented with the support of a qualified third-party actuary. As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $79.9 million of self-insurance liabilities. The ultimate resolution of these claims could differ materially from the assumptions used to calculate the self-insurance liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative D isclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our bank credit facilities. We utilize these borrowings to meet our working capital needs.
At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings totaling $297.5 million, of which $210.6 million are subject to variable interest rates under our credit agreement. In the event that interest rates associated with this facility were to increase 100 basis points, the after tax impact on annual future cash flows would be a decrease of $1.5 million.
Market Risk
We regularly use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to market risk related to changes in the current and future market price of home heating oil and vehicle fuels. The value of market sensitive derivative instruments is subject to change as a result of movements in market prices. Sensitivity analysis is a technique used to evaluate the impact of hypothetical market value changes. Based on a hypothetical ten percent increase in the cost of product at December 31, 2022, the potential impact on our hedging activity would be to increase the fair market value of these outstanding derivatives by $14.4 million to a fair market value of $13.2 million; and conversely a hypothetical ten percent decrease in the cost of product would decrease the fair market value of these outstanding derivatives by $10.1 million to a fair market value of $(11.3) million.
Item 4.
Controls and
Procedures
a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
The General Partner’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, such chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022 at the reasonable level of assurance. For purposes of Rule 13a-15(e), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”) (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
b) Change in internal control over financial reporting
No changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
c) Other
The General Partner and the Company believe that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a Company have been detected. Therefore, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide such reasonable assurances of achieving our desired control objectives, and the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the General Partner have concluded, as of December 31, 2022, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in achieving that level of reasonable assurance.
