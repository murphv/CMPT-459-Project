NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Nowtransit Inc. (the “Company”, “us”, “we”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 8, 2019. We have not generated any revenues, have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. We were formed to engage in the online delivery business, but in connection with the Change of Control described in the following paragraph, the Company has terminated its plans in the online delivery business. Since the Change of Control, we commenced seeking new business opportunities in the United States. Our goal is to acquire a privately-held business looking to go public through a reverse merger in which a large majority of our outstanding stock will be issued to the equity owners of a target business.
NOTE 2: GOING CONCERN
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $ 146,317
as of November 30, 2022 and $ 117,400
as of August 31, 2022. The Company had losses of $ 28,917
for the three months ended November 30, 2022, and $ 14,089
for the three months ended November 30, 2021, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management’s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.
We may require additional capital for our operations and for any operating entity that we acquire. Economic downturns, including a recession, combined with high inflation and investor uncertainties may limit or hinder our ability to obtain the funding we require. If we are unable to raise capital or the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with any revenues we may generate from future operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, our future operating results may be materially adversely affected.
NOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The Company’s year-end is August 31.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had $ 28,343
and $ 16,253
in cash as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively, and no cash equivalents.
Concentration of Credit Risks
The Company maintains funds in a financial institution that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. As such, funds are insured based on Federal Reserve limits. At November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, the Company did not have cash deposits in excess of these insured limits.

Table of Contents
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
FASB ASC Topic 820,
"Fair Value Measurement,"
defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The standards apply to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The Company determines the fair values of its assets and liabilities based on a fair value hierarchy that includes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.
The three levels are defined as follows:
Level 1:
defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level 2:
defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
Level 3:
defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
Due to their short-term nature, the carrying values of the Company’s current assets and liabilities approximated fair value at November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022.
Income Taxes
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences). The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share
The Company computes loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260 “Earnings per Share.” Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholder by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential shares of common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive. During the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, there were
420,000
and
300,000 , respectively, potentially dilutive common shares outstanding with respect to convertible preferred stock (Note 7), which were anti-dilutive due to the Company's net loss for the period.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We have reviewed all recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, and do not believe, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements
This Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our discussions and the anticipated terms of a potential reverse merger pursuant to which we would acquire an operating business, our business plan and our liquidity needs. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Report, including statements regarding our future financial position, liquidity, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words “believe,” “may,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “should,” “plan,” “could,” “target,” “potential,” “is likely,” “will,” “expect” and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs.
The results anticipated by any or all of these forward-looking statements might not occur. Important factors, uncertainties and risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include those described elsewhere in this Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 under “Item 1A. – Risk Factors.” We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as the result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Overview
We have no operations since inception other than the expenditures related to running the Company, and we have not generated any revenue since inception. Our goal is to finalize a share exchange agreement with an early-stage nutraceutical company (the “Target”) and consummate the acquisition. However, we cannot assure we will close the acquisition.
Plan of Operation
On August 15, 2022, we executed a non-binding term sheet with the Target (the “Term Sheet”). The Term Sheet required the Share Exchange Agreement to be executed by September 15, 2022. Although it was not, we are continuing to pursue the acquisition under which the shareholders of the Target would receive approximately 84.43% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, the Term Sheet envisioned one or more investors investing $50,000 and receiving convertible preferred stock, convertible into approximately 0.84% of our outstanding common stock (the “Financing”). The Target recently consummated a financing in the amount of $50,000 with an investor and we therefore do not anticipate consummating the Financing if and when the reverse merger with the Target is consummated.
The evaluation and selection of a business opportunity is a complex and uncertain process. Our President has experience in management and business consulting, although no assurances can be given that he can identify and implement a viable business strategy or that any such strategy will result in profits. Our ability to effectively identify, develop and implement a viable plan for our business may be hindered by risks and uncertainties which are beyond our control, including without limitation, the impact of any recession caused by inflation and rising interest rates as well as the war in Ukraine and lingering effects, or new variants of, COVID-19. These factors may disproportionately affect smaller businesses which comprise our principal target. See Item 1A - Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 1, 2022.
During the next 12 month period we anticipate incurring costs in connection with investigating, evaluating and negotiating potential business combinations, filing SEC reports, and consummating an acquisition of an operating business. If we close the acquisition with the Target or a similar transaction with a third party these expenses will increase.
Given our limited capital resources, we may consider a business combination with an entity which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company or is otherwise in need of additional funds for the development of new products or services or expansion into new markets, or is an established business experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. Alternatively, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, an entity which desires access to the U.S. capital markets.
10
Table of Contents
As of the date of this Report, the Company has not entered into a definitive agreement to consummate a business combination. Any target business that is selected may be financially unstable or in the early stages of development. In such event, we expect to be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or early stage entity. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk or in which our management has limited experience, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.
Our management anticipates that we will likely only be able to effect one business combination due to our limited capital. This lack of diversification will likely pose a substantial risk in investing in the Company for the indefinite future because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture or operating territory against gains from another. The risks we face will likely be heightened to the extent we acquire a business operating in a single industry or geographic region.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Management’s discussion and analysis and results of operations are based upon our accompanying financial statements for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, which in turn may impact our reported revenue and expenses. Our actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Results Of Operations
THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2022 COMPARED TO NOVEMBER 30, 2021
Our net loss for the three months ended November 30, 2022 was $28,917, compared to a net loss of $14,089 during the three months ended November 30, 2021. The Company has not generated any revenue in either period. The increase in net loss was due to an increase in general administrative expenses including professional fees in connection with the preparation of SEC reports and our ongoing search for a business to acquire and costs related to negotiations and due diligence in connection therewith. Expenses incurred were general administrative expenses of $28,917, during the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to $14,089 during the three months ended November 30, 2021.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of November 30, 2022, our total assets were $28,343, consisting of cash.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities since inception. For the three months ended November 30, 2022, net cash flows used in operating activities was $27,910, consisting of our net loss of $28,917 and an increase of $1,007 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Cash flows used in operating activities for the three months ended November 30, 2021 was $5,901, consisting of our net loss of $14,089 and a decreases of $4,279 in prepaid expenses and an increase of $3,909 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
We have not engaged in any investing activities since our inception.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
For the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, net cash flows provided by financing activities was $40,000 and $100,000, respectively, consisting of gross proceeds from the sale of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A”) for cash as described in the following paragraphs.
11
Table of Contents
On November 22, 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor pursuant to which the Company sold to the purchaser 40,000 shares of the Series A at a purchase price of $1.00 per share (the “Offering”). The Company received $40,000 in gross proceeds from the Offering.
On November 3, 2021, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor pursuant to which the Company sold to the purchaser 100,000 shares of the Company’s Series A at a purchase price of $1.00 per share. The Company received $100,000 in gross proceeds from the Offering. Each share of the Series A is convertible into three shares of the Company’s common stock.
PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING
Our existing working capital is expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next 12 months, unless we are able to reach an understanding with a target which will cause us to incur material professional fees. In that event, we will have to borrow funds from our President or seek other funding. Because of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s amended Rule 15c2-11, the OTC Markets specifies that a shell company can only continue to publicly trade for 18 months following its initial quotation by a market maker. As a result, we are under some pressure to consummate a reverse merger as soon as possible in order to continue to be eligible for public quotation on the OTC Markets. We have financed operations to date through the proceeds of loans from insiders and the private placement of equity. We expect we will need to raise additional capital to meet long-term operating requirements, particularly if we close a reverse merger resulting in our acquisition of an operating business.
On August 15, 2022, we executed a non-binding Term Sheet with an early-stage nutraceutical company (the “Target”). The Term Sheet required the Share Exchange Agreement to be executed by September 15, 2022. Although it was not, we are continuing to pursue the acquisition under which the shareholders of the Target would receive approximately 84.43% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, the Term Sheet envisioned one or more investors investing $50,000 and receiving convertible preferred stock, convertible into approximately 0.84% of our outstanding common stock (the “Financing”). The Target recently consummated a financing in the amount of $50,000 with an investor and we therefore do not anticipate consummating the Financing if the reverse merger with the Target is consummated.
The evaluation and selection of a business opportunity is a complex and uncertain process. While we are hopeful of closing the reverse merger with the Target, we cannot assure you we will do so. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Going Concern
There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We have no operations, cumulative losses, and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in acquiring an operating business or commencing material business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the search for and establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.
There can be no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms as and when needed, we may be unable to commence, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing stockholders.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of November 30, 2022 (the “Evaluation Date”), the Company’s management evaluated, with participation of its principal executive officer, the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s principal executive officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of November 30, 2022.
Management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation Date based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The material weaknesses identified during management’s assessment were (i) a lack of sufficient internal accounting resources; (ii) a lack of segregation of duties to ensure adequate review of financial statement preparation, (iii) lack of an independent board of directors or audit committee, and (iv) lack of written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. In light of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting at the Evaluation Date. We plan to rectify these weaknesses by establishing written policies and procedures for our internal control of financial reporting and hiring additional accounting personnel at such time as we raise sufficient capital to do so. There were no changes in controls during the quarter ended November 30, 2022.

As of the date of this Quarterly Report, no director, officer or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings. Management is not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us or our properties.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales Of Equity Securities and Use Of Proceeds
On November 22, 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor pursuant to which the Company sold to the purchaser 40,000 shares of the Series A at a purchase price of $1.00 per share (the “Offering”). The Company received $40,000 in gross proceeds from the Offering. Each share of the Series A is convertible into three shares of the Company’s common stock at the holder’s discretion. The offer and sale of the Series A was not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof and Rule 506(b) promulgated thereunder.
