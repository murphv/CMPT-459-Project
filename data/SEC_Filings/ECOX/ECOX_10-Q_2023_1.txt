On October 4, 2021, Eco Innovation Group, Inc. (the
"Company") entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Spruce Construction, Inc.,
an Alberta Business Corporation (“Spruce Construction”) and Timothy Boetzkes ("Boetzkes"), a resident of the Province
of Alberta, Canada and the sole shareholder of Spruce Construction, pursuant to which, the Company, Boetzkes and Spruce Construction agreed
to effect an asset purchase agreement for existing construction equipment and form a new Canadian engineering and construction company
in Canada, Spruce engineering & Construction Inc. The Company will own
85 % of the voting interests of Spruce Engineering & Construction
Inc., with Boetzkes owning
10 % and Patrick Laurie
5 %. See Note 6 – Acquisition for more information.
On January 4, 2022, the Company
formed a subsidiary, ECOX Spruce Construction, Inc., a California corporation (“ECOX Spruce Construction”), for the purpose
of starting a green construction division. On January 25, 2022, Eco Innovation Group, Inc. (the "Company"), through its California
subsidiary ECOX Spruce Construction , entered into a staffing and administrative services agreement (the “Construction Services
Agreement”) with Blueprint Construction, a licensed California general contractor (“Blueprint Construction”) and Edgar
E. Aguilar ("Aguilar"), a resident of California and the principal of Blueprint Construction, pursuant to which, Blueprint Construction,
Aguilar and ECOX Spruce Construction agreed that ECOX Spruce Construction will oversee the operation of Blueprint’s construction
business in California. Under the Company’s existing LOI with Aguilar, Blueprint Construction will own 20% of the equity interests
of ECOX Spruce Construction Inc., and the Company will own 80%.
Under the Construction Services
Agreement, the Company agreed to manage all of Blueprint Construction’s contracting business on behalf of Blueprint Construction,
for a renewable term of one year. Through ECOX Spruce Construction, the Company will provide all necessary corporate administration, shared
services, compliance needs, construction staffing placement, general business infrastructure and support necessary for Blueprint’s
performance under its general contracting and subcontracting projects as Blueprint’s exclusive provider of such services. Blueprint’s
current active projects consist of a subcontracting agreement to renovate U.S. military base facilities, with a job value of $136,000.
The Construction Services Agreement provides that ECOX Spruce Construction will receive a management fee equal to twenty percent (20%)
of all collected cash revenues from Blueprint’s business.
Under its business plan implemented in February
2020, the Company is an innovation incubator platform devoted to globally important paradigm shifts in technology, sustainable and carbon
negative products development and practical deployment worldwide. The Company seeks to license
and develop innovative technologies in the sustainable and
renewable
energy field.
Accounting policies and procedures are listed below.
The Company has adopted a December 31 year-end.
Basis of Presentation
The
Company
has
prepared the
financial
statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United
States of America (GAAP). The
results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year.
Use of Estimates
The
preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United
States of America
requires
management to make estimates
and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and
liabilities
and
disclosure of contingent assets
and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and
the reported amounts of
revenue
and
expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ
from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less as cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
the Company had
no
cash or cash equivalent balances in excess of federally insured amounts. The Company’s policy is to invest excess
funds in only well capitalized financial institutions.
Earnings per share
Basic
Earnings
Per
Share
(EPS)
is computed by dividing income available to
common
stockholders by the weighted-average
number of
common
shares
outstanding
for
the period. Diluted EPS includes the potential dilution that could occur if
options
or other contracts to issue
common
stock
were
exercised or converted under outstanding convertible debt and outstanding common stock warrants.
Long-Lived Assets
The Company’s long-lived assets,
including intangibles, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost
carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the asset by comparing the
undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the
undiscounted future net cash flows of the asset, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as
the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived asset. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022,
and the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company evaluated long lived assets for impairment determined
no
impairment was necessary.
10
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company does not use derivative instruments
to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such
instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted
for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with
changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The Company used a Black Scholes valuation model to value the derivative
instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments
should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified
in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required
within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic
820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
priority to unadjusted quoted price in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority
to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:
·
Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices
for
identical instruments in active markets;
·
Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that
are
either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices
for
similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices
for
identical or similar instruments in markets that
are
not active;
and
·
Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity
to
develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers
are
unobservable.
The estimated fair values for financial instruments
are determined at discrete points in time based on relevant market information. These estimates involve uncertainties and cannot be determined
with precision. We measure our investment in marketable securities at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company’s trading securities
are valued using inputs observable in active markets and are therefore classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Investments
and derivative liabilities are valued on a recurring basis.
The following summarizes the fair value of assets
and liabilities measured on a recurring basis:

Stock- Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is computed in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718. FASB ASC 718
requires all share-based payments to employees and non- employees be recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated financial
statements based on their fair values. The expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services
in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). As of September 30, 2022, the Company has
not adopted a Stock Option Plan and has not issued any options.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Fixed assets are carried at cost. Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method of depreciation over the assets’ estimated useful lives. Maintenance and repairs are charged
to expense as incurred; major renewals and improvements are capitalized. When items of fixed assets are sold or retired, the related cost
and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in income.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is the total of the
current taxes payable and the net of the change in the deferred income taxes. Provision is made for the deferred income taxes where differences
exist between the period in which transactions affect current taxable income and the period in which they enter into the determination
of net income in the financial statements.
11
Revenue Recognition
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company
recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 2014- 09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which
supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance
throughout the Industry Topics of the Accounting Standards Codification. The updated guidance states that an entity should recognize revenue
to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also provides for additional disclosures with respect to revenues
and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The standard will be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and the Company adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach effective January
1, 2018.
Under the new revenue standards, the Company recognizes
revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects
to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five-step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09:
(i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price;
(iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy
the performance obligation. The Company recognized revenue from the sale of services at the time in which the services are delivered pursuant
to the contract.
The Company had $ 191,231
and $ 618,992
in revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and $0
in revenues During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, all related to construction projects in its subsidiaries.
Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Other comprehensive income (loss) includes
foreign currency translation gains and losses. The cumulative amount of translation gains and losses are reflected as a separate component
of stockholders’ equity (deficit) in the consolidated balance sheets, as accumulated other comprehensive income.
Reclassification
Certain reclassifications
have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation primarily the change to the
Company’s par value being reflected retroactively and to reclassify related party convertible debt.
NOTE 2.
GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT’S LIQUIDITY
PLANS
The
accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and
the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the
Company
had net
losses of $ 2,254,686
and $ 6,632,146
during the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 and the
year
ended December
31,
2021
,
respectively
and
an accumulated deficit of $ 14,831,992
and $ 12,594,976
at September 30 ,
2022
and December 31, 2021,
respectively . These
factors raise substantial
doubt
about
the
Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern
for
a period of one year from the issuance of
these
financial
statements. Management’s plans
are
to
obtain additional financing in the debt
and
equity markets
while
it
develops
its
business
model.
The
Company’s
existence is dependent upon
management’s
ability to develop profitable operations
and
to
obtain
additional
funding sources.
There
can
be no assurance that the Company’s financing efforts will result in
profitable
operations
or the resolution of the Company’s liquidity problems.
The
accompanying statements
do not include
any
adjustments that might result should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.
NOTE 3.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Management does not believe that any recently
issued but not yet adopted accounting will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operation or on the reported amounted
of its assets and liabilities upon adoption.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06,  Debt
-   Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity
(Subtopic 815-40):   Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity).  ASU 2020-06 reduces
the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock, which results in fewer embedded conversion
features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current GAAP. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 affects the diluted
earnings per share calculation for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares and for convertible instruments and requires enhanced
disclosures about the terms of convertible instruments and contracts in an entity's own equity. ASU 2020-06 allows entities to use a modified
or full retrospective transition method and is effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that this
ASU may have on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 5.
ACQUISITION
Asset Purchase Agreement
On October 4, 2021, Eco Innovation Group, Inc. (the
"Company") entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Spruce Construction, Inc.,
an Alberta Business Corporation (“Spruce Construction”) and Timothy Boetzkes ("Boetzkes"), a resident of the Province
of Alberta, Canada and the sole shareholder of Spruce Construction, pursuant to which, the Company, Boetzkes and Spruce Construction agreed
to effect an asset purchase agreement for existing construction equipment and form a new Canadian engineering and construction company
in Canada. The Company entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement for the purpose of launching a green construction division in Alberta,
Canada.
Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company
agreed to pay Boetzkes one million shares of the Company’s restricted common stock and assume as liability a contingent cash
payment to Spruce Construction in the amount of approximately $ 104,000 ,
specifically to pay, from future net cash flow over the next 12 months, certain of Spruce Construction’s expenses and
liabilities, to purchase from Spruce Construction for substantially all of the assets and business of Spruce Construction,
consisting of vehicles, tools and equipment for the construction industry, the Spruce Construction name, and the existing book of
construction business of Spruce Construction. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company, Boetzkes and Patrick Laurie,
the CEO of the Company’s Canadian technology subsidiary, ECOIG Canada, have formed a new Alberta Business Corporation to own
and deploy the acquired construction assets, named Spruce Engineering & Construction Inc. The Company owns
85 %
of the voting interests of Spruce Engineering & Construction Inc., with Boetzkes owning
10 %
and Patrick Laurie
5 %.
The closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement was subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions to closing, as disclosed in the term sheet for the project disclosed by the Company
and filed as Exhibit 10.1 in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on August 11, 2021. The Company is accounting for the acquisition as a business combination under the guidance of ASC805.
On April 21, 2022, the Company entered into an
amendment number one to the Asset Purchase Agreement with Boetzkes and Spruce Construction, to extend the due date for the
contingent cash payments under the Asset Purchase Agreement in the amount of approximately $ 104,000
USD ($ 130,000
CAD) due to Spruce Construction under the Asset Purchase Agreement. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement the $104,000 USD ($130,000
CAD) payment was due at 6 months after closing, and pursuant to the April 21, 2022 first amendment, that payment was due at 12
months after the closing date, or October 3, 2022. As of the date of this filing, none of the contingent cash payments have been
made to Spruce Construction under the Asset Purchase Agreement. On December 29, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment number
two to the Asset Purchase Agreement with Boetzkes and Spruce Construction, to extend the due date and establish a monthly pay
schedule for the approximately $104,000 USD ($130,000 CAD) in total due to Boetzkes and Spruce Construction under the Asset Purchase
Agreement. Under the December 29, 2022 second amendment, monthly payments of approximately $3,000 are now due beginning on January
31, 2023 to continue until the entire balance is paid. Additionally, the Company agreed to provide compensation to Boetzkes of one
million restricted common shares in consideration for the failure to pay by the original APA deadline, which was a result of
inadequate net cash flows within Spruce Engineering & Construction, Inc.
Lock-Up Leak-Out Agreement
On October 4, 2021, in connection with the Asset Purchase
Agreement, Boetzkes entered into a Lock-Up and Leak-Out Agreement with the Company pursuant to which, among other thing, such shareholder
agreed to certain restrictions regarding the resale of the common stock issued pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement for a period of
six months from the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement, as more fully detailed therein.
Shareholders Agreement
On October 4, 2021, in connection with the Asset Purchase
Agreement, the Company entered into a shareholders agreement (the “Shareholders Agreement”) with Timothy Boetzkes and Patrick
Laurie. Under the Shareholders Agreement, Patrick Laurie agreed to serve as the Chief Executive Officer and Timothy Boetzkes agreed to
serve as the Chief Operating Officer of Spruce Engineering & Construction Inc. The Shareholders Agreement provides for certain terms
of governance, restrictive covenants including confidentiality and noncompetition, and transfer restrictions on the parties’ equity
with regards to Spruce Engineering & Construction Inc.
Employment Agreements
On October 4, 2021, in connection with the Asset Purchase
Agreement, Spruce Engineering & Construction Inc., of which the Company is the 85% voting equity holder, entered into employment agreements
(the “Employment Agreements”) with Timothy Boetzkes and Patrick Laurie, pursuant to which Patrick Laurie shall serve as the
Chief Executive Officer and Timothy Boetzkes shall serve as the Chief Operating Officer of Spruce Engineering & Construction Inc.
Ancillary to the Employment Agreements, Boetzkes and Laurie also entered into restricted stock award agreements governing their minority
equity stakes in Spruce Engineering & Construction Inc., which provide for a repurchase option allowing Spruce Engineering & Construction
Inc. to clawback equity in the event of the employees’ for-cause termination.
The acquisition
of Spruce Construction is being accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805. The Company is continuing to gather evidence to
evaluate what identifiable intangible assets were acquired, such as a customer list, and the fair value of each, and expects to finalize
the fair value of the acquired assets within one year of the acquisition date.

NOTE 7.
CONVERTIBLE NOTES
Convertible Notes Payable
On March 22, 2021, the Company entered into a convertible
promissory note agreement with Claudia Villalta for the issuance of a convertible promissory note with a principal balance of $ 30,000 .
The note carries a  10 % interest rate per annum and is convertible at a fixed price of $ 0.06  a share into a total of  500,000  common
shares. Due to the variable conversion feature on the other notes, this note is tainted with no net share settlement available, the note
conversion feature was bifurcated from the note and recorded as a derivative liability. This note was in default as of September 30, 2022.
On June 4, 2021,  the Company entered into
a securities purchase agreement (the “Labrys SPA”) with Labrys Fund, LP (“Labrys”), pursuant to which the Company
issued a 12% promissory note (the “Labrys Note”) with a maturity date of June 3, 2022 (the “Labrys Maturity Date”),
in the principal sum of $1,000,000. Pursuant to the terms of the Labrys Note, the Company agreed to pay to $225,000 (the “Principal
Sum”) to Labrys and to pay interest on the principal balance at the rate of 12% per annum. The Labrys Note carries an original issue
discount (“OID”) of $22,500. Accordingly, on the Closing Date (as defined in the Labrys SPA), Labrys paid the purchase price
of $202,500 in exchange for the Labrys Note. Labrys may convert the Labrys Note into the Company’s common stock (subject to the
beneficial ownership limitations of 4.99% in the Labrys Note) at any time at a fixed conversion price equal to $0.023 per share but can
be reset if the Company issues instruments at a lower price. The Company paid $14,650 of deferred financing costs which are amortized
through the maturity date of the note.  During the year ended December 31, 2021 the Company made payments of $ 77,000 , reducing the
outstanding note balance to $ 148,000 . Due to the dilutive issuance clauses on the conversion price, the note conversion feature was bifurcated
from the note and recorded as a derivative liability. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, $ 139,500
of principal and $ 27,000
in accrued interest was converted into
54,369,190
shares of common stock. In addition, the Company repaid $8,500 in principal to settle
the note in full.
On August 23, 2021, the Company entered
into a securities purchase agreement (the “Blue Lake SPA”) with Blue Lake Partners, LLC (“Blue Lake”), pursuant
to which the Company issued a  12 % promissory note (the “Blue Lake Note”) with a maturity date of August 23, 2022 (the
“Blue Lake Maturity Date”), in the principal sum of $ 150,000 . Pursuant to the terms of the Blue Lake Note, the Company agreed
to pay to $ 150,000  (the “Principal Sum”) to Blue Lake and to pay interest on the principal balance at the rate of  12 %
per annum. The Blue Lake Note carries an original issue discount (“OID”) of $ 15,000 . Accordingly, on the Closing Date (as
defined in the Blue Lake SPA), Blue Lake retained an additional $ 9,450  of legal fees and paid the purchase price of $ 125,500  in
exchange for the Blue Lake Note. Blue Lake may convert the Blue Lake Note into the Company’s common stock (subject to the beneficial
ownership limitations of  4.99 % in the Blue Lake Note) at any time at a fixed conversion price equal to $ 0.02  per share but can
be reset if the Company issues instruments at a lower price. Due to the dilutive issuance clauses on the conversion price, the note conversion
feature was bifurcated from the note and recorded as a derivative liability. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, $100,116
of principal was converted into 111,680,000 shares of common stock.
15
The Company may prepay the Blue Lake Note
at any time prior to the date that an Event of Default (as defined in the Blue Lake Note) occurs at an amount equal to 100% of the Principal
Sum then outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest (no prepayment premium) plus $ 7,530
for administrative fees. The Blue Lake Note
contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties, and
breach of provisions of the Blue Lake Note or Blue Lake SPA.
Upon the occurrence of any Event of
Default, the Blue Lake Note shall become immediately due and payable and the Company shall pay to Blue Lake, in full satisfaction of its
obligations hereunder, an amount equal to the Principal Sum then outstanding plus accrued interest multiplied by 125% (the “Default
Amount”). Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, additional interest will accrue from the date of the Event of Default at the
rate equal to the lower of 16% per annum or the highest rate permitted by law.
On November 14, 2022, we filed with the SEC a Notification
of Late Filing pursuant to Rule 12b-25 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 indicating that we were unable to timely file our Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, which was due on or before November 14, 2022. We indicated at the time that
we expected to file this Report no later than November 19, 2022, which is the fifth calendar day filing extension period afforded registrants
under Rule 12b-25 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of November 19, 2022, however, we remained unable to file this quarterly
report. As such, from November 19, 2022 until December 22, 2022, the date of filing of this Report, we were in default under the Blue
Lake Note with respect to its compliance requirements, as a result of our delay in filing this quarterly report with the SEC. As of the
filing date, the Company has not received a notice of default regarding the Blue Lake Note.
The Blue Lake Note requires that the
Company reserve from its authorized and unissued common stock a number of shares equal to the greater of: (a)  11,250,000  shares
of our common stock, or (b) the sum of (i) the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to the
Blue Lake Note and such additional shares of common stock, if any, as are issuable on account of interest on the Note pursuant to the
Blue Lake SPA issuable upon the full conversion of the Blue Lake Note (assuming no payment of the principal amount or interest) as of
any issue date multiplied by (ii) one and a half. The Company is subject to penalties for failure to timely deliver shares to Blue Lake
following a conversion request.
The Blue Lake SPA and the Blue Lake
Note contain covenants and restrictions common with this type of debt transaction. Furthermore, the Company are subject to certain negative
covenants under the Blue Lake SPA and the Blue Lake Note, which we believe are customary for transactions of this type. At September 30,
2022, we were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions.
In conjunction with the issuance of
the Blue Lake Note, the Company issued a five year warrant exercisable for  6,000,000  shares of common stock at an exercisable
price of $ 0.025  per share subject to anti-dilution and price protection adjustments. The warrants are accounted for as a liability
based on the variable number of shares issuable under outstanding convertible debt and the warrants.
On August 23, 2021, the Company entered
into a securities purchase agreement (the “Coventry SPA”) with Coventry Enterprises, LLC (“Coventry”), pursuant
to which the Company issued a  10 % promissory note (the “Coventry Note”) with a maturity date of May 9, 2023 (the
“Coventry Maturity Date”), in the principal sum of $ 150,000 . Pursuant to the terms of the Coventry Note, the Company agreed
to pay $ 150,000  (the “Principal Sum”) to Coventry and to pay interest on the principal balance at the rate of  10 %
per annum. The Coventry Note carries an original issue discount (“OID”) of $ 30,000 . Accordingly, on the Closing Date (as defined
in the Coventry SPA), Coventry retained an additional $ 7,200  of legal fees and paid the purchase price of $ 112,800  in exchange
for the Coventry Note. Coventry may convert the Coventry Note into the Company’s common stock (subject to the beneficial ownership
limitations of  4.99 % in the Coventry Note) in the event of default at a variable conversion price equal to 90% of the lowest per-share
during the 20 trading day period before the conversion. The note requires monthly payments of $ 23,571
commencing on November 8, 2022.
In conjunction with the issuance of
the Coventry Note, the Company issued
10,000,000  shares of common stock. The shares are accounted for as deferred financing costs
with a value of $ 30,000
which will be amortized through the maturity date of the note.
On November 14, 2022, we filed with the SEC a Notification
of Late Filing pursuant to Rule 12b-25 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 indicating that we were unable to timely file our Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, which was due on or before November 14, 2022. We indicated at the time that
we expected to file this quarterly report no later than November 19, 2022, which is the fifth calendar day filing extension period afforded
registrants under Rule 12b-25 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of November 19, 2022, however, we remained unable to file this
quarterly report. As such, from November 19, 2022 until December 22, 2022, the date of filing of this Report, we were in default under
the Coventry Note with respect to its compliance requirements, as a result of our delay in filing this quarterly report with the SEC.
On December 21, 2022, the Company received a written notice of default from Coventry Enterprises, informing us that the default provisions
of the note were in effect, bringing the principal balance of the note from $ 150,000
to $ 180,000 .
On February 4, 2022, the Company entered
into a convertible promissory note (the “SRAX Note”) with SRAX, Inc (“SRAX”), pursuant to which the Company issued
a  1 % promissory note with a maturity date of  February 4, 2025  (the “SRAX Maturity Date”), in the principal
sum of $ 120,000 . Pursuant to the terms of the SRAX Note, the Company agreed to pay $ 120,000  (the “Principal Sum”) to
SRAX and to pay interest on the principal balance at the rate of 1% per annum. The SRAX Note was issued in exchange for services
rendered. SRAX may convert the SRAX Note into the Company’s common stock (subject to the beneficial ownership limitations of  4.99 %
in the SRAX Note) at the lower of $0.0033 or 85% of the lowest per-share during the 5 trading day period before the conversion.

Convertible Notes Payable – Related Parties
On March 1, 2016, the Company executed
two convertible notes of $ 4,902
each with former executives of the
Company. These notes are each convertible into
50,000,000
shares of common stock. These notes are non-interest bearing. On October 14, 2019, one of these notes converted into common stock.
In May 2020, Robert L. Hymers purchased half of the remaining convertible promissory note and its related conversion rights from John
English in a private transaction. In May 2020, John English converted principal of $ 2,451
into
25,000,000
shares of common stock. The remaining principal balance owed to Robert L. Hymers of $ 2,451
was convertible into
25,000,000
shares of stock at December 31, 2021. On January 10, 2022, the Company issued
18,500,000
shares of common stock to Hymers upon partial conversion of the principal balance of the promissory note, so that as of the date
of this filing, the note is convertible into 6,500,000 shares of common stock.
On November 14, 2022, we filed with the SEC a Notification
of Late Filing pursuant to Rule 12b-25 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 indicating that we were unable to timely file our Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, which was due on or before November 14, 2022. We indicated at the time
that we expected to file this Report no later than November 19, 2022, which is the fifth calendar day filing extension period afforded
registrants under Rule 12b-25 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of November 19, 2022, however, we remained unable to file this
quarterly report. As such, from November 19, 2022 until January 6, 2023, the date of filing of this Report, we were in default under
the note with respect to its compliance requirements, as a result of our delay in filing this quarterly report with the SEC. On December
23, 2022, the Company received a written notice of default from Robert L. Hymers III, informing us that the default provisions of the
note were in effect.
On December 9, 2019, the Company executed
a convertible note with Pinnacle Consulting Services Inc. (“Pinnacle”), which is owned by Robert L. Hymers III, for
$ 40,000
which matured on

5 %
per annum, which is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock. The note is convertible at the option of the holder,
into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock as is determined by dividing that portion of the outstanding
principal balance under the note by the Conversion Price, which is a 35% discount of the lowest reported sale price of the common stock
for the 15 trading days immediately prior to the date of conversion. Due to the variable conversion feature, the note conversion feature
was bifurcated from the note and recorded as a derivative liability. This note was in default as of September 30, 2022. On December 23,
2022, the Company received a additional written notice of default from Robert L. Hymers III, confirming that the default provisions of
the note were in effect and the note was in default as of September 30, 2022.

due on September 30, 2021. This note bears interest at

per annum and is convertible (in whole or in part), at the option of the Holder, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares
of common stock as is determined by dividing that portion of the outstanding principal balance under this Note by the Conversion Price,
which is a 35% discount of the lowest reported sale price of the common stock for the 15 trading days immediately prior to the date of
conversion. Due to the variable conversion feature, the note conversion feature was bifurcated from the note and recorded as a derivative
liability. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 the note and all accrued interest was converted in full into
46,894,863 .
On October 19, 2021, the Company executed
a convertible note with Pinnacle, for $ 180,000 , to settle outstanding consulting fees, due on April 19, 2022. This note bears interest
at
10 % per annum and is convertible (in whole or in part), at the option of the Holder, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable
shares of common stock as is determined by dividing that portion of the outstanding principal balance under this Note by the Conversion
Price of $ 0.0075
but can be reset if the Company issues instruments at a lower price. Due to the dilutive issuance clauses on the conversion
price, the note conversion feature was bifurcated from the note and recorded as a derivative liability.
On November 14, 2022, we filed
with the SEC a Notification of Late Filing pursuant to Rule 12b-25 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 indicating that we were unable
to timely file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, which was due on or before November 14, 2022.
We indicated at the time that we expected to file this Report no later than November 19, 2022, which is the fifth calendar day filing
extension period afforded registrants under Rule 12b-25 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of November 19, 2022, however, we
remained unable to file this quarterly report. As such, from November 19, 2022 until January 6, 2023, the date of filing of this Report,
we were in default under the note with respect to its compliance requirements, as a result of our delay in filing this quarterly report
with the SEC. On December 23, 2022, the Company received a written notice of default from Robert L. Hymers III, informing us that the
default provisions of the note were in effect.
On March 23, 2022, the Company executed
a convertible note with Robert Hymers for $ 55,000
due on September 19, 2022. This note bears interest at
10 %
per annum and is convertible (in whole or in part), at the option of the Holder, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares
of common stock as is determined by dividing that portion of the outstanding principal balance under this Note by the Conversion Price,
$ 0.000098 . On April 21, 2022, the Company
and Hymers entered into a debt exchange agreement, whereby the Company exchanged the $ 55,000
Note convertible at a Conversion Price of $ 0.000098
per share for a $60,000 note convertible at $ 0.002
per share, all other note terms remaining unchanged. The Company determined that due to the change in fair value of the conversion
option being significant, the modification of the note should be accounted for as a debt extinguishment, with the resulting loss on extinguishment
being recorded in additional paid-in capital because Mr. Hymers is a related party. On December 23, 2022, the Company received a written
notice of default from Robert L. Hymers III, informing us that the default provisions of the note were in effect.

On March 25, 2022, the Company
executed a convertible note with Alma Otey, a related party, for $ 23,000 , due on July 13, 2022. This note bears interest at
10 % per
annum and is convertible (in whole or in part), at the option of the Holder, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable
shares of common stock as is determined by dividing that portion of the outstanding principal balance under this Note by the
Conversion Price of $ 0.000098
but can be reset if the Company issues instruments at a lower price. Due to the dilutive issuance
clauses on the conversion price, the note conversion feature was bifurcated from the note and recorded as a derivative liability.
The note requires monthly payments of $7,333 until the balance is paid in full. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the
Company has made payments of $ 5,000
on the note.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
This discussion and analysis may include statements
regarding our expectations with respect to our future performance, liquidity, and capital resources. Such statements, along with any other
non-historical statements in the discussion, are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,
including, but not limited to, factors listed in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC'').
We do not assume an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained
in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements contained herein.
The outbreak of COVID-19 evolved into a global
pandemic as COVID-19 spread to many regions of the world. In response to COVID-19, governmental authorities around the world implemented
measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These measures have and may continue to adversely affect workforces, customers, supply chains,
consumer sentiment, economies, and financial markets. In addition, decreased consumer spending has and may continue to lead to an economic
downturn globally.
Specifically, numerous state and local jurisdictions
have and may in the future impose shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, shut-downs of non-essential businesses, and similar government
orders and restrictions on their residents to control the spread of COVID-19. Such orders or restrictions have resulted in temporary facility
closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and travel restrictions, among other effects, thereby adversely impacting our operations. As a result
of COVID-19, we have experienced a reduction in sales of our products and slower lead times with respect to the manufacturing of our products.
In addition, a downturn in the United States economy may have an adverse impact on discretionary consumer spending which may have a significant
impact on our business operations and/or our ability to generate revenues and profits.
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business
and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information
that may emerge concerning COVID-19, including variants such as the delta variant, and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact,
among others. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts of COVID-19 on our business; however, these effects could have a material
impact on our operations and financial condition.
Overview and Financial Condition
We are an innovative entrant into the green technology
licensing and construction space, and as a recently registered publicly traded company with our initial S-1 registration statement declared
effective as of January 15, 2021 and our common stock registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act on April 27, 2022, we are one
of the few publicly-traded green technology development firms in the U.S. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have more than two
years of implementing our business plan under new management following our change of control in late February 2020.
Our total operating and other expenses in excess of
our gross profit have resulted in a net loss of $6,632,146 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and a net loss of $2,254,686 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2022, which, considered in light of our past financial performance, give rise to the going concern statement
below. In furthering our business, as described in Item 1 above concerning our business and operations, we are seeking to license commercially
viable green technologies that fulfill concrete market demands, and develop product applications that we can sell into the market. Our
technology licensing and product development activities are spearheaded by Julia Otey-Raudes, our Chief Executive Officer.
Green Construction
Division – USA and Canada
Spruce Engineering & Construction,
Inc. – Canada
Asset Purchase Agreement
On October 4, 2021, Eco Innovation Group, Inc. (the
"Company") entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Spruce Construction, Inc.,
an Alberta Business Corporation (“Spruce Construction”) and Timothy Boetzkes ("Boetzkes"), a resident of the Province
of Alberta, Canada and the sole shareholder of Spruce Construction, pursuant to which, the Company, Boetzkes and Spruce Construction agreed
to effect an asset purchase agreement for existing construction equipment and form a new Canadian engineering and construction company
in Canada. The Company entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement for the purpose of launching a green construction division in Alberta,
Canada.
Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed
to pay Boetzkes one million shares of the Company’s restricted common stock and assume as liability a contingent cash payment to
Spruce Construction in the amount of approximately $104,000, specifically to pay, from future net cash flow over the next 12 months, certain
of Spruce Construction’s expenses and liabilities , to purchase from Spruce Construction substantially all of the assets and business
of Spruce Construction, consisting of vehicles, tools and equipment for the construction industry, the Spruce Construction name, and the
existing book of construction business of Spruce Construction. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company, Boetzkes and Patrick
Laurie, the CEO of the Company’s Canadian technology subsidiary, ECOIG Canada, have formed a new Alberta Business Corporation to
own and deploy the acquired construction assets, named Spruce Engineering & Construction Inc. The Company owns 85% of the voting interests
of Spruce Engineering & Construction Inc., with Boetzkes owning 10% and Patrick Laurie 5%.
The closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement was subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions to closing, as disclosed in the term sheet for the project disclosed by the Company
and filed as Exhibit 10.1 in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on August 11, 2021. The Company is accounting for the acquisition as a business combination under the guidance of ASC805.
On April 21, 2022, the Company entered into an
amendment number one to the Asset Purchase Agreement with Boetzkes and Spruce Construction, to extend the due date for the
contingent cash payments under the Asset Purchase Agreement in the amount of approximately $104,000 USD ($130,000 CAD) due to Spruce
Construction under the Asset Purchase Agreement. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement the $104,000 USD ($130,000 CAD) payment was due at
6 months after closing, and pursuant to the April 21, 2022 first amendment, that payment was due at 12 months after the closing
date, or October 3, 2022. As of the date of this filing, none of the contingent cash payments have been made to Spruce Construction
under the Asset Purchase Agreement. On December 29, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment number two to the Asset Purchase
Agreement with Boetzkes and Spruce Construction, to extend the due date and establish a monthly pay schedule for the approximately
$104,000 USD ($130,000 CAD) due to Boetzkes and Spruce Construction under the Asset Purchase Agreement. Under the December 29, 2022
second amendment, monthly payments of $4,000 are now due beginning on January 31, 2023 to continue until the entire balance is paid.
Additionally, the Company agreed to provide compensation to Boetzkes of one million restricted common shares in consideration for
the failure to pay by the original APA deadline, which was a result of inadequate net cash flows within Spruce Engineering &
Construction, Inc.
19
The closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement was subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of customary conditions to closing, as disclosed in the term sheet for the project disclosed by the Company and filed as Exhibit
10.1 in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 11,
2021.
Lock-Up Leak-Out Agreement
On October 4, 2021, in connection with the Asset Purchase
Agreement, Boetzkes entered into a Lock-Up and Leak-Out Agreement with the Company pursuant to which, among other thing, such shareholder
agreed to certain restrictions regarding the resale of the common stock issued pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement for a period of
six months from the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement, as more fully detailed therein.
Shareholders Agreement
On October 4, 2021, in connection with the Asset Purchase
Agreement, the Company entered into a shareholders agreement (the “Shareholders Agreement”) with Timothy Boetzkes and Patrick
Laurie. Under the Shareholders Agreement, Patrick Laurie agreed to serve as the Chief Executive Officer and Timothy Boetzkes agreed to
serve as the Chief Operating Officer of Spruce Engineering & Construction Inc. The Shareholders Agreement provides for certain terms
of governance, restrictive covenants including confidentiality and noncompetition, and transfer restrictions on the parties’ equity
with regards to Spruce Engineering & Construction Inc.
Employment Agreements
On October 4, 2021, in connection with the Asset Purchase
Agreement, Spruce Engineering & Construction Inc., of which the Company is the 85% voting equity holder, entered into employment agreements
(the “Employment Agreements”) with Timothy Boetzkes and Patrick Laurie, pursuant to which Patrick Laurie shall serve as the
Chief Executive Officer and Timothy Boetzkes shall serve as the Chief Operating Officer of Spruce Engineering & Construction Inc.
Ancillary to the Employment Agreements, Boetzkes and Laurie also entered into restricted stock award agreements governing their minority
equity stakes in Spruce Engineering & Construction Inc., which provide for a repurchase option allowing Spruce Engineering & Construction
Inc. to clawback equity in the event of the employees’ for-cause termination.
ECOX Spruce Construction, Inc. – USA
On January 4, 2022, the Company formed a subsidiary,
ECOX Spruce Construction, Inc., a California corporation (“ECOX Spruce Construction”), for the purpose of starting a green
construction division. Pursuant to a letter of intent (LOI) between ECOX and Edgar E. Aguilar ("Aguilar"), a resident of California
and licensed California general contractor, Aguilar agreed to manage the operation of ECOX Spruce Construction’s construction business
in California as its Responsible Managing Officer. Under the Company’s existing LOI with Aguilar, Blueprint Construction will own
20% of the equity interests of ECOX Spruce Construction Inc., and the Company will own 80%. ECOX Spruce Construction is in the process
of securing a general contractor license in California, with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer as principal applicant. That
application was approved and the Company is in the process of securing workman’s compensation insurance and bonding so that the
license will become active. Once ECOX Spruce Construction is fully licensed and bonded as a California general contractor, the Company
intends to seek certification as a Women’s Business Enterprise.
Going Concern
Because of recurring operating losses, net
operating cash flow deficits, and an accumulated deficit, our independent auditors have indicated in their report on our December
31, 2021 financial statements that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The continuation of our business is dependent upon
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations, in which we have not been successful, and/or obtaining
additional financing from our stockholders or other sources, as may be required. The issuance of additional equity or convertible debt
securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans,
assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.

Corporate
Information
The Company’s shares are quoted on the OTC Markets
Pink Sheet tier, under the symbol ECOX. Our executive offices are located at 16525 Sherman Way, Suite C-1, Van Nuys, CA 91406, and our
telephone number is (800) 922-4356.
We maintain an internet website, and our internet
address is https://www.ecoig.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report or in any other
filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
We are an “emerging growth company,” as
defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”).
As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public
companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor
attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations
regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding
advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors
find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities
may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act
also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)
of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company”
can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to
take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until
the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in
which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated
filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior September
30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year
period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting
company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure
obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements, and, if their revenues are less
than $100 million, not providing an independent registered public accounting firm attestation on internal control over financial reporting.
We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares
held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of that year or (2) our annual revenues
exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds
$700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of that year.
Reports to security holders
We are required to file annual, quarterly and current
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our filings are available to the public over the internet at the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s website at http://www.sec.gov. The public may read and copy any materials filed by us with the Securities
and Exchange Commission at the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street N.E. Washington D.C. 20549.
The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the Securities and Exchange Commission at 1-800-732-0330.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of September 30, 2022 and December 31,
2021, the Company had cash of $15,398 and $28,534, respectively. Furthermore, the Company had a working capital deficit of $4,049,241
and $4,509,624 as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
During the nine months ended September 30,
2022, the Company used $536,581 of cash in operating activities due to its net loss of $2,254,686, partially offset by; amortization of
debt discount of $647,418; expense from shares to be issued to MCOA under the share exchange agreement of $1,086,323, stock-based compensation
expense of $76,800, derivative gain of $362,662 and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $246,192.

stock of $45,450, partially offset by repayments of convertible debentures of $217,250.
Our auditors have issued a going concern
opinion on our annual consolidated financial statements, meaning that there is substantial doubt we can continue as an on-going business
for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. Our only sources for cash at this time are investments by others in this
offering, selling our products and loans from our director. We must raise cash to implement our plan and stay in business.
Management believes that current trends toward
lower capital investment in start-up companies pose the most significant challenge to the Company’s success over the next year and
in future years. Additionally, with the January 15, 2021 effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1, as of January 15, 2021,
the Company is obligated to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company.
The Company’s management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various
regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required
of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations.
22
Limited Operating History; Need for Additional
Capital
There is no historical financial information
about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. As our business model and strategy were reinvigorated with our February
2020 change in control and new management, we are in a start-up stage of operations, and in general have generated limited revenues since
our inception. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our success and performance are subject to
all the normal risks inherent in the development of a new line of business, including our limited capital resources and the strength
of our business partners’ business and financial positions, and the market for our green technologies.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have
a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair
presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.

About Market Risk .
As a smaller reporting company, we are not required
to provide the information called for by this Item.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of its management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end
of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission's
rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There
were no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Item 2. Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
During the nine months ended September 30,
2022, the Company entered into purchase agreements for the sale of 205,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock with Geneva
Roth Remark Holdings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, $221,250 of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and accrued dividends
of $11,063 were converted into 153,892,604 shares of common stock.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, 296,383,893
shares of common stock were issued by the Company for the conversion of $343,599 in principal and interest of a convertible note.
Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.
On August 23, 2021, the Company entered
into a securities purchase agreement (the “Coventry SPA”) with Coventry Enterprises, LLC (“Coventry”), pursuant
to which the Company issued a 10% promissory note (the “Coventry Note”) with a maturity date of May 9, 2023 (the
“Coventry Maturity Date”), in the principal sum of $150,000. Pursuant to the terms of the Coventry Note, the Company agreed
to pay $150,000 (the “Principal Sum”) to Coventry and to pay interest on the principal balance at the rate of 10%
per annum. The Coventry Note carries an original issue discount (“OID”) of $30,000. Accordingly, on the Closing Date (as defined
in the Coventry SPA), Coventry retained an additional $7,200 of legal fees and paid the purchase price of $112,800 in exchange
for the Coventry Note. Coventry may convert the Coventry Note into the Company’s common stock (subject to the beneficial ownership
limitations of 4.99% in the Coventry Note) in the event of default at a variable conversion price equal to 90% of the lowest per-share
during the 20 trading day period before the conversion. The note requires monthly payments of $23,571 commencing on November 8, 2022.
On November
14, 2022, we filed with the SEC a Notification of Late Filing pursuant to Rule 12b-25 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 indicating
that we were unable to timely file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, which was due on or before
November 14, 2022. We indicated at the time that we expected to file this quarterly report no later than November 19, 2022, which is the
fifth calendar day filing extension period afforded registrants under Rule 12b-25 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of November
19, 2022, however, we remained unable to file this quarterly report. As such, from November 19, 2022 until December 22, 2022, the date
of filing of this Report, we were in default under the Coventry Note with respect to its compliance requirements, as a result of our delay
in filing this quarterly report with the SEC. On December 21, 2022, the Company received a written notice of default from Coventry Enterprises,
informing us that the default provisions of the note were in effect, bringing the principal balance of the note from $150,000 to $180,000.
