FRANKLIN WIRELESS CORP.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary, Franklin Technology Inc. ("FTI"), with a majority voting interest of
66.3 % (approximately
33.7 % is owned by non-controlling interests) as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022. In the preparation of consolidated
financial statements of the Company, intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated and net earnings are reduced by the portion
of the net earnings of the subsidiary applicable to non-controlling interests.
As consolidated financial statements
are based on the assumption that they represent the financial position and operating results of a single economic entity, the retained
earnings or deficit of the subsidiary at the date of acquisition, October 1, 2009, by the parent are excluded from consolidated retained
earnings. When a subsidiary is consolidated, the consolidated financial statements include the subsidiary’s revenues, expenses,
gains, and losses only from the date the subsidiary is initially consolidated, and the non-controlling interest is reported in the consolidated
statement of financial position within equity, separately from the parent’s equity. There are no shares of the Company held by any
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022, or June 30, 2022.
Non-controlling Interest in a Consolidated Subsidiary
As of December 31, 2022, the
non-controlling interest was $ 1,564,559 ,
which represents a $ 5,046
decrease from $ 1,569,605
as of
June 30, 2022. The decrease in the non-controlling interest of $ 5,046
was from loss in the subsidiary of $ 14,991
incurred for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
Segment Reporting
Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 280, “Segment Reporting,” requires public companies to report financial and descriptive information about
their reportable operating segments. We identify our operating segments based on how our chief operating decision maker internally evaluates
separate financial information, business activities and management responsibility. We have one reportable segment, consisting of the
sale of wireless access products.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could materially differ from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of financial
instruments such as cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt approximate the related fair
values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. We invest our excess cash into financial instruments which are readily convertible
into cash, such as money market funds and certificates of deposit.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Based upon our review of our collection
history as well as the current balances associated with all significant customers and associated invoices, as of December 31, 2022, we
did
no t believe an allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary.
Revenue Recognition
In April 2016, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2016-10), which amends and adds clarity
to certain aspects of the guidance set forth in the original revenue standard (ASU 2014-09) related to identifying performance obligations
and licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), which amends and
rescinds certain revenue recognition guidance previously released within ASU 2014-09. In May 2016 the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2016-12), which provides narrow scope improvements and practical
expedients related to ASU 2014-09.
On July 1, 2018, we adopted ASU
2014-09 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed or substantially complete as of June
30, 2018. Results for the reporting period beginning after July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606. We recorded no change in retained
earnings as of July 1, 2018 as a result of the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606.
Contracts with Customers
Revenue for sales of products
and services is derived from contracts with customers. The products and services promised in contracts primarily consist of hotspot routers.
Contracts with each customer generally state the terms of the sale, including the description, quantity and price of each product or service.
Payment terms are stated in the contract, primarily in the form of a purchase order. Since the customer typically agrees to a stated rate
and price in the purchase order that does not vary over the life of the contract, the majority of our contracts do not contain variable
consideration. We establish a provision for estimated warranty and returns. Using historical averages, that provision for the quarter
ended December 31, 2022 was not material.
Disaggregation of Revenue
In accordance with Topic 606,
we disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers into geographical regions and by the timing of when goods and services are transferred.
We determined that disaggregating revenue into these categories meets the disclosure objective in Topic 606, which is to depict how the
nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by regional economic factors.
10
Contract Balances
We perform our obligations under
a contract with a customer by transferring products in exchange for consideration from the customer. We typically invoice our customers
as soon as control of an asset is transferred, and a receivable is established. We, however, recognize a contract liability when a customer
prepays for goods and/or services, or we have not delivered goods under the contract since we have not yet transferred control of the
goods and/or services.
The balances of our trade receivables
are as follows:
Schedule of receivables
December 31, 2022
June 30, 2022
Accounts Receivable
$ 8,071,545
$ 1,322,619
The balance of contract assets
was immaterial as we did not have a significant amount of un-invoiced receivables in the periods ended December 31, 2022, and June 30,
2022.
Our contract liabilities are as
follows:
Schedule of contract liabilities
December 31, 2022
June 30, 2022
Undelivered products
$ 272,790
$ 371,624
Performance Obligations
A performance obligation is a
promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of measurement in Topic 606. At contract
inception, we assess the products and services promised in our contracts with customers. We then identify performance obligations to transfer
distinct products or services to the customer. In order to identify performance obligations, we consider all the products or services
promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices.
Our performance obligations are
primarily satisfied at a point in time. Revenue from products transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for 99.9% of
net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Revenue recognized over a period of time for non-recurring engineering projects
is based on the percent complete of a project and accounted for 0.1% of net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The majority
of our revenue recognized at a point in time is for the sale of hotspot router products. Revenue from these contracts is recognized when
the customer is able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product which generally coincides with
title transfer at completion of the shipping process.
As of December 31, 2022, our contracts
do not contain any unsatisfied performance obligations, except for undelivered products.
Cost of Goods Sold
All costs associated with our
contract manufacturers, as well as distribution, fulfillment and repair services, are included in our cost of goods sold. Cost of goods
sold also includes amortization expenses of approximately $ 168,000
and $ 334,000
associated with capitalized product development costs
associated with complete technology for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and approximately $ 80,825
and
$ 158,825
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
Capitalized Product Development Costs
Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) Topic 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other” includes software that is part of a product or process to
be sold to a customer and is accounted for under Subtopic 985-20. Our products contain embedded software internally developed by FTI,
which is an integral part of these products because it allows the various components of the products to communicate with each other and
the products are clearly unable to function without this coding.
11
The costs of product development
that are capitalized once technological feasibility is determined (noted as technology in progress in the Intangible Assets table in Note
3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) include related licenses, certification costs, payroll, employee benefits, and other
headcount-related expenses associated with product development. We determine that technological feasibility for our products is reached
after all high-risk development issues have been resolved. Once the products are available for general release to our customers, we cease
capitalizing the product development costs and any additional costs, if any, are expensed. The capitalized product development costs are
amortized on a product-by-product basis using the greater of straight-line amortization or the ratio of the current gross revenues to
the current and anticipated future gross revenues. The amortization begins when the products are available for general release to our
customers.
As of December 31, 2022, and June
30, 2022, capitalized product development costs in progress were $ 128,322
and $ 187,343 , respectively, and the amounts are included in
intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheets. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred $ 553,730
and $ 1,046,980 ,
respectively, and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, we incurred $ 418,146
and $ 453,689 , respectively, in capitalized
product development costs, and such amounts are primarily comprised of certifications and licenses. All costs incurred before technological
feasibility is reached are expensed and included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Research and Development Costs
Costs associated with research
and development are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs were $ 976,415
and $ 1,107,139
for the
three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 1,946,535
and $ 2,129,041
for the
six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Warranties
We provide a warranty for one
year which is covered by our vendors and manufacturers under purchase agreements between the Company and the vendors. As a result, we
believe we do not have any net warranty exposure and do not accrue any warranty expenses. Historically, the Company has not experienced
any material net warranty expenditures.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Costs associated with product
shipping and handling are expensed as incurred.  Shipping and handling costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative
expenses on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, were $ 89,553
and $ 57,568
for the three months ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively, and $ 130,106
and $ 102,952
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the consolidated
statements of cash flow, we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. We invest our excess cash into financial instruments which management believes are readily convertible into cash, such as
money market funds that are readily convertible to cash and have a $1.00 net asset value.
Short Term Investments
We have invested excess funds
in short term liquid assets, such as certificates of deposit.
12
Inventories
Our inventories consist of finished
goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined on a first-in, first-out basis. We assess the
inventory carrying value and reduce it, if necessary, to its net realizable value based on customer orders on hand, and internal demand
forecasts using management’s best estimates given information currently available. Our customer demand is highly unpredictable and
can fluctuate significantly caused by factors beyond the control of the Company. We may write down our inventory value for potential obsolescence
and excess inventory.  As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, we have recorded inventory reserves in the amount of $ 557,155
for inventories that we have identified as obsolete or slow-moving.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded
at cost. Significant additions or improvements extending useful lives of assets are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged
to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows:
Useful lives of property and equipment
Machinery
6
years
Office equipment
5
years
Molds
3
years
Vehicles
5
years
Computers and software
5
years
Furniture and fixtures
7
years
Facilities improvements
5 years or life of the lease, whichever is shorter
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and certain intangible
assets were recorded in connection with the FTI acquisition in October 2009, and are accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, “Business
Combinations.” Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible net assets
acquired. Intangible assets are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and other intangible assets
are accounted for in accordance with ASC 350, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Goodwill and other intangible assets
are tested for impairment at least annually and any related impairment losses are recognized in earnings when identified. No impairment
was deemed necessary as of December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022.
Long-lived Assets
In accordance with ASC 360, “Property,
Plant, and Equipment,” we review for impairment of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. We consider the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable based
upon our review of the following events or changes in circumstances: the asset’s ability to continue to generate income from operations
and positive cash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the assets; significant changes in our strategic business
objectives and utilization of the asset; or significant negative industry or economic trends. An impairment loss would be recognized when
estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset are less than its carrying amount.
As of December 31, 2022, and June
30, 2022, we were not aware of any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the long-lived assets are impaired.
13
Stock-based Compensation
Our employee share-based awards
result in a cost that is measured at fair value on an award’s grant date, based on the estimated number of awards that are expected
to vest. Compensation costs are recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award, i.e., the vesting
period. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Transactions with non-employees in which
goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the
consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Stock-based compensation
costs are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income based upon the underlying recipients' roles within
the Company.
Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability
method of accounting for income taxes. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between
the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences
are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets, unless it is more likely
than not such assets will be realized. Current income taxes are based on the year’s taxable income for federal and state income
tax reporting purposes and the annual change in deferred taxes.
We assess its income tax positions
and records tax benefits based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting
date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we record the largest amount of tax
benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of
all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no
tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. We classify interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions
as a component of income tax expense.
As of December 31, 2022, we have
no material unrecognized tax benefits. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $ 118,866
and $ 15,483
for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2022, respectively, and an income tax benefit of $ 476,752
and $ 888,008
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021,
respectively. We also recorded a decrease in deferred tax asset, non-current, of $ 118,866
and $ 14,683
for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2022, respectively, and an increase in deferred tax asset, non-current, of $ 492,925
and $ 932,493
for the three and six months
ended December 31, 2021, respectively.
Earnings (loss) per Share Attributable to Common
Stockholders
Earnings (loss) per share is calculated
by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares that were outstanding for the period, without consideration
for potential common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the sum of the weighted-average
number of dilutive potential common shares outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method or the as-converted method.
Potentially dilutive shares are comprised of common stock options outstanding under our stock plan.
Concentrations
We extend credit to our customers
and perform ongoing credit evaluations of such customers. We evaluate our accounts receivable on a regular basis for collectability and
provide for an allowance for potential credit losses as deemed necessary.  No reserve was required or recorded for any of the
periods presented.
Substantially all of our revenues
are derived from sales of wireless data products.  Any significant decline in market acceptance of our products or in the financial
condition of our existing customers could impair our ability to operate effectively.
14
A significant portion of our revenue
is derived from a small number of customers. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, sales to our largest customer accounted for
83 %
of our consolidated net sales, and
63 % of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2022. In the same period of 2021, sales to
our two largest customers accounted for
50 % and
19 % of our consolidated net sales, and
0 % and
36 % of our accounts receivable balance as
of December 31, 2021. No other customers accounted for more than ten percent of total net sales for the six months ended December 31,
2022 and 2021.
For the six months ended December
31, 2022, we purchased the majority of our wireless data products from three manufacturing companies located in Asia. If these manufacturing
companies were to experience delays, capacity constraints or quality control problems, product shipments to our customers could be delayed,
or our customers could consequently elect to cancel the underlying product purchase order, which would negatively impact the Company's
revenue. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, we purchased wireless data products from these manufacturers in the amount of $ 17,274,499 ,
or
99 % of total purchases, and had related accounts payable of $ 11,147,080
as of December 31, 2022. In the same period of 2021, we purchased
wireless data products from two manufacturers in the amount of $ 4,981,572 , or
99 % of total purchases, and had related accounts payable
of $ 2,856,783
as of December 31, 2021.
We maintain our cash accounts
with established commercial banks. Such cash deposits exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limit of $250,000 for each
financial institution.  However, we do not anticipate any losses on excess deposits.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Leases
In February 2016, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02 (Topic 842). Topic
842 amended several aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize leases with a term greater than one year as
a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments. In July 2018, the FASB issued supplemental
adoption guidance and clarification to Topic 842 within ASU 2018-10 “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases” and ASU
2018-11 “Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements.” The new guidance aims to increase transparency and comparability among
organizations by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key
information about leasing arrangements. A modified retrospective application is required with an option to not restate comparative periods
in the period of adoption.
With effect from July 1,
2019, we have adopted the provisions of the new standard. We decided to use the practical expedients available upon adoption of
Topic 842 to aid the transition from current accounting to provisions of Topic 842. The package of expedients will effectively allow
us to run off existing leases, as initially classified as operating and classify new leases after implementation under the new
standard as the business evolves.
We have an operating lease
principally for both Franklin Wireless Corp. and Franklin Technologies Inc. Management evaluates each lease independently to determine
the purpose, necessity to its future operations in addition to other appropriate facts and circumstances.
We adopted Topic 842 using
a modified retrospective approach for our existing lease at July 1, 2019. The adoption of Topic 842 impacted our balance sheet by the
recognition of the operating lease right-of-use assets and the liability for operating leases. The lease liability is based on the present
value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using a market based incremental borrowing rate as the effective date of July 1, 2019
using current estimates as to lease term including estimated renewals for each operating lease.
On September 9, 2015, we signed
a lease for office space consisting of approximately 12,775 square feet, located in San Diego, California, at a monthly rent of $ 23,115 ,
which commenced on October 28, 2015. In addition to monthly rent, the lease includes payment for certain common area costs. The original
term of the lease for the new office space was four years from the lease commencement date and was then extended by an additional fifty
months, to December 31, 2023. Our facility is covered by an appropriate level of insurance, and we believe it to be suitable for our use
and adequate for our present needs. Rent expense for this office space was $ 77,263
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021
and $ 154,526
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
18
Our Korea-based subsidiary, FTI,
leases approximately 10,000 square feet of office space, at a monthly rent of approximately $8,000, and additional office space consisting
of approximately 2,682 square feet at a monthly rent of approximately $2,700, both located in Seoul, Korea. These leases will expire on
August 31, 2023. In addition to monthly rent, the leases provide for periodic cost of living increases in the base rent and payment for
certain common area costs. These facilities are covered by an appropriate level of insurance, and we believe them to be suitable for our
use and adequate for our present needs. Rent expense related to these leases was approximately $ 32,100
for the three months ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, and approximately $ 64,200
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. This facility is also covered by an
appropriate level of insurance, and we believe it to be suitable for our use and adequate for our present needs.
We lease one corporate housing
facility, located in Seoul, Korea, primarily for our employees who travel, under a non-cancelable operating lease that will expire on
September 4, 2023. Rent expense related to this lease was $ 2,021
and $ 2,756
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and
approximately $ 3,951
and $ 4,979
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
As of December 31, 2022, we used
discount rates of
4.0 % in determining our operating lease liabilities for the office space in San Diego, California. This rate represented
our incremental borrowing rate at that time. Short-term leases with initial terms of twelve months or less are not capitalized. Our San
Diego office lease was an extension of a previous lease and does not contain any further extension provision.

Litigation
We are from time to time involved
in certain legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
Verizon Jetpack Recall
On April 8, 2021, Verizon issued
a press release announcing that it is working with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to conduct a voluntary recall of
certain Verizon Ellipsis Jetpack mobile hotspot devices, indicating that the lithium-ion battery in the devices can overheat, posing a
fire and burn hazard. According to the CPSC release, the recall affects approximately 2.5 million devices. We imported the devices and
supplied them to Verizon.
19
Verizon first advised us of one
alleged Jetpack device failure at the end of February 2021. We immediately began meeting with Verizon and requested access to the device.
We also began internal testing to evaluate device performance. We did not receive any further incident information until the last week
of March 2021. On April 1, 2021 we issued a press release announcing that we had received reports from Verizon about potential issues
with the batteries in the devices. On April 9, 2021 we issued a press release announcing the voluntary recall by Verizon.
As of the date of this report,
we have been unable to recreate any device failures of the type identified by Verizon. All internal testing conducted to date has confirmed
that the Jetpack devices are performing within normal parameters. We are not currently aware of any aspect of the Jetpack design that
could cause the devices to fail in the way described in Verizon’s recall notice.
Future Impact on Financial
Performance
We are striving to avoid any litigation
arising from the recall and have not been served with any legal action relating to the products covered by the recall. We are not currently
able to estimate the financial impact of the recall on our future operations. At this time, we do not have information that identifies
the cause of the alleged incidents. We also do not have any specific legal claims or theories of causation for device failure incidents
that would help us estimate the cost of potential future litigation. No liability has been recorded for this litigation because the Company
believes that any such liability is not probable and reasonably estimable at this time.
Shareholder Litigation
Ali
A shareholder action, Ali vs.
Franklin Wireless Corp. et al. Case #3:21-cv-00687-AJB-MSB, was filed in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of California (San

Pape
A legal action was filed in the
Second Judicial District Court of Nevada in the County of Washoe against Franklin, as a nominal defendant, Barbara Pape, derivatively
on behalf of nominal defendant Franklin Wireless Corp. v. OC Kim, Et al., Case # CV22-00471, on or about March 21, 2022, claiming among
other things, that we had prior knowledge that the recall was likely and that we did not disclose that information to investors in a timely
manner. We believe these allegations are not supported by the facts and we will vigorously defend against such claims.
The Company will vigorously defend
such shareholder litigation and proceedings. No liability has been recorded for these litigations because the Company believes that any
such liability is not probable and reasonably estimable at this time.
“Short-Swing” Profits
Litigation
A legal action was filed in the
U.S. District Court, Southern District of California (San Diego) against Franklin, as a nominal defendant, Nosirrah Management LLC v.
Franklin Wireless et al. Case # 3:21-cv-01316-CAB-JLB, on or about July 22, 2021, claiming that our Chief Executive Officer, OC Kim, violated
Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for receiving “short-swing” profits from a sale and purchase of Franklin
shares, in violation of that Act. We believe the allegations are not supported by the facts and we intend to vigorously defend against
these claims. No liability has been recorded for this litigation because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable
and reasonably estimable at this time.
Franklin v.
Anydata, Inc.
We entered into a Professional
Services Agreement with Anydata Corp. (“Anydata”) for the product ACT233F Smart Link OBD device on May 5, 2017, for a minimum
purchase commitment of 250,000 units. We have delivered approximately 25,000 units and 7,000 units during our second and fourth quarters
of fiscal 2018, respectively, and an additional 18,000 units during our first quarter of fiscal 2019. Sales to Anydata were approximately
$1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. We have received information that Anydata may not be able to fulfill the entire purchase
commitment for which parts have already been ordered from our main vendor, Quanta. We believe that the Company will be able to supply
some of the products to another customer and has received personal guarantees from the ownership group of Anydata. As of June 30, 2019,
the remaining unfulfilled purchase commitment was approximately $3.1 million. The total product purchase commitment with Quanta was approximately
$2.9 million. We have not recorded a receivable from Anydata, nor a liability owed to Quanta. Management believes that, at this time,
a loss contingency is reasonably possible but not estimable as to how much ultimately would be paid to Quanta. As of June 30, 2020, we
paid $ 100,000
for the right to call on inventory and recorded an additional $ 49,580
as a prepaid expense related to pricing adjustments,
which has been agreed with Quanta for other products to ensure demand is met, and for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the prepaid
expense of $ 149,580
has been recorded as a cost of goods sold. As of December 31, 2022, there is a reasonable possibility we may incur
a loss; however, the amount is not estimable at this time. On January 25 th , 2021, we commenced legal action against Anydata
and its principal officers in San Diego Superior Court, case number 37-2021-00003468-CU-BC-CTL. As of the date of this report, litigation
is continuing, and the action is not yet resolved.
Aperture Net LLC. v. Franklin
Wireless Corp.
On November 29, 2022 Aperture
Net LLC (“Aperture Net”) filed a patent infringement suit against Franklin, alleging that Franklin Wireless’ R910 Mobile
Hotspot infringes U.S. Patent No. 6711,204, entitled “Channel sounding for a spread-spectrum signal.” We believe the allegations
are not supported by the facts and we intend to vigorously defend against these claims. No liability has been recorded for this litigation
because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable and reasonably estimable at this time.
Pandemic Disease
Current reports appear to indicate
that COVID-19 has now become an endemic illness and no longer represents a significant factor in ongoing operations or the current sales
cycle. As COVID-19 demonstrated over the past several years, another infectious disease could arise and negatively affect operations at
our third-party manufacturers, which could result in delays or disruptions in the supply of our products. While a new disease or Pandemic
outbreak in the future could increase demand for Franklin products, the related impacts can’t be reasonably estimated at this time.
21
Change of Control Agreements
On October 1, 2020, we entered
into Change of Control Agreements with OC Kim, our President, and Yun J. (David) Lee, our Chief Operating Officer. Each Change of Control
Agreement provides for a lump sum payment to the officer in case we experience a change of control. The term includes the acquisition
of our Common Stock resulting in one person or company owning more than 50% of the outstanding shares, a significant change in the composition
of the Board of Directors during any 12-month period, a reorganization, merger, consolidation or similar transaction resulting in the
transfer of ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of our outstanding Common Stock, or a liquidation or dissolution or sale of substantially
all of our assets.
The Change of Control Agreement
with Mr. Kim calls for a payment of $5 million upon a change of control, and the agreement with Mr. Lee calls for a payment of $2 million
upon a change of control.
Severance Agreement
On
November 10, 2022 the Company and OC Kim, its President, entered into an amendment of the employment letter agreement dated September
7, 2021. The amendment provides for a severance payment of $3 million if Mr. Kim voluntarily terminates his employment by the Company
or if he voluntarily terminates his employment due to a “change in circumstances,” generally defined as a material breach
by the Company of its salary and benefit obligations or a significant reduction in Mr. Kim’s title or responsibilities. In the case
of a termination of employment by the Company for cause (generally defined as conviction of a felony, or a misdemeanor where imprisonment
is imposed, commission of any act of theft, fraud, dishonesty, or material falsification of any employment or Company records, or improper
disclosure of the Company's confidential or proprietary information), the Company is to make a severance payment of $1,500,000. In either
case, any unvested options become immediately vested.
In
the amendment, Mr. Kim also agrees that, for a period of two years after termination, he will not disparage the Company or its officers,
solicit any of its employees to terminate their employment, or disclose any of the Company’s proprietary information.
In
addition, the amendment provides for the payment of an incentive bonus to Mr. Kim of $125,000 for each calendar quarter during the remaining
four year term of the employment letter, with the first such bonus due on December 31, 2022.
International Tariffs
We believe that our products are
currently exempt from international tariffs upon import from our manufacturers to the United States. If this were to change at any point,
a tariff of 10%-25% of the purchase price would be imposed. If such tariffs are imposed, they could have a materially adverse effect on
sales and operating results.
Customer Indemnification
Under purchase orders and contracts
for the sale of our products we may provide indemnification to our customers for potential intellectual property infringement claims for
which we may have no corresponding recourse against our third-party licensors. This potential liability, if realized, could materially
adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
NOTE 9 -
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS
We apply the provisions of ASC
718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” to all of our stock-based compensation awards and use the Black-Scholes option pricing
model to value stock options. Under this application, we record compensation expense for all awards granted.
In 2009, we adopted the Stock
Incentive Plan (“2009 Plan”), which provided for the grant of incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options to our
employees and directors. Options granted under the 2009 Plan generally have a term of ten years and generally vest and become exercisable
at the rate of 33% after one year and 33% on the second and third anniversaries of the option grant dates. Historically, some stock option
grants have included shorter vesting periods ranging from one to two years.
In July of 2020, the Board of
Directors adopted the 2020 Franklin Wireless Corp. Stock Option Plan (the “2020 Plan”), which covers
800,000
shares of Common
Stock. The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options and restricted stock to our employees,
directors, and independent contractors. These options will have such vesting or other provisions as may be established by the Board of
Directors at the time of each grant.
The estimated forfeiture rate
considers historical turnover rates stratified into employee pools in comparison with an overall employee turnover rate, as well as expectations
about the future. We periodically revise the estimated forfeiture rate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
There were $ 360,525
and $ 192,465
compensation expenses recorded under this method for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included
elsewhere in this report.  This report contains certain forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial
performance.  These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially
from those discussed in this report.  You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information, which speaks only as
of the date of this report.  We are not obligated to publicly update this information, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise, except to the extent we are required to do so in connection with our obligation to file reports with the SEC.
For a discussion of the important risks to our business and future operating performance, see the discussion under the caption “Item
1A. Risk Factors” and under the caption “Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations” in the Company’s
Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, filed on September 13, 2022.  In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions,
the forward-looking events discussed in this report might not occur.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
We are a leading provider of
integrated wireless solutions utilizing the latest in 4G LTE (fourth generation long-term evolution) and 5G (fifth generation) technologies
including mobile hotspots, routers, CPEs (Customer Premise Equipment), and various trackers. Our integrated software subscription services
provide users remote capabilities including mobile device management (MDM) and software defined wide area networking (SD-WAN).
We have majority ownership of
Franklin Technology Inc. (FTI), a research and development company based in Seoul, South Korea. FTI primarily provides design and development
services for our wireless products.
Our products are generally marketed
and sold directly to wireless operators and indirectly through strategic partners and distributors. Our global customer base primarily
extends from North America to Asia.
FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We believe that our revenue growth
will be influenced largely by (1) the successful maintenance of our existing customers, (2) the rate of increase in demand for wireless
data products, (3) customer acceptance of our new products, (4) new customer relationships and contracts, and (5) our ability to
meet customers’ demands.
We have entered into and expect
to continue to enter into new customer relationships and contracts for the supply of our products, and this may require significant demands
on our resources, resulting in increased operating, selling, and marketing expenses associated with such new customers.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our discussion and analysis of
our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements in
accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions
have been prepared on the basis of the most current reasonably available information. The results of these estimates form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
We have several critical
accounting policies, which were described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, that are both
important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult,
subjective, and complex judgments. Typically, the circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective, and complex have to
do with making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. There were no material changes to our critical
accounting policies during the six months ended December 31, 2022.

THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 COMPARED TO
THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021
NET SALES
- Net sales increased
by $7,162,054, or 393.2%, to $8,983,643 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $1,821,589 for the corresponding period of 2021.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, net sales by geographic regions, consisting of North America and Asia, were $8,950,134 (99.6%
of net sales) and $33,509 (0.4% of net sales), respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, net sales by geographic regions,
consisting of North America, the countries in the Caribbean and South America, and Asia, were $1,284,850 (70.5% of net sales), $2,375
(0.1% of net sales), and $534,364 (29.4%), respectively.
Net sales in North America increased
by $7,665,284, or 596.6%, to $8,950,134 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $1,284,850 for the corresponding period of 2021.
The increase in net sales in North America was primarily due to the demands for two newly launched wireless products from two major carrier
customers, which did not purchase our products during the corresponding period of 2021. Net sales in the Caribbean and South America decreased
by $2,375, or 100.0%, to $0 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $2,375 for the corresponding period of 2021. The decrease
in net sales was primarily due to the general nature of sales in these regions, which often fluctuate significantly from period to period
due to the timing of orders placed by a relatively small number of customers. Net sales in Asia decreased by $500,855, or 93.7%, to $33,509
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $534,364 for the corresponding period of 2021. The decrease in net sales was primarily
due to the one-time revenue generated from the material sales by FTI for the corresponding prior period, which typically vary from period
to period.
GROSS PROFIT -
Gross profit
increased by $582,062, or 159.9%, to $946,042 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $363,980 for the corresponding period
of 2021. The gross profit in terms of net sales percentage was 10.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 20.0% for
the corresponding period of 2021. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the change in net sales as described above. The decrease
in gross profit in terms of net sales percentage was primarily due to the revenues (approximately 58% of net sales) generated from one
newly launched product during the three months ended December 31, 2022, which involved a substantially higher cost of goods sold (approximately
93%), which was partially offset by the revenues generated from other sales of the products with lower costs of goods sold.
25
OPERATING EXPENSES
- Operating
expenses increased by $180,449, or 8.5%, to $2,312,382 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $2,131,933 for the corresponding
period of 2021.
Selling, general, and administrative
expenses increased by $311,173 to $1,335,967 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $1,024,794 for the corresponding period
of 2021. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to the increased payroll expenses, compensation
expenses related to stock options granted for employees, and commission expense for sales of approximately $183,000, $82,000, and $49,000,
respectively. Research and development expense decreased by $130,724 to $976,415 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, from $1,107,139
for the corresponding period of 2021. The decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to the mix of the timing of research
and development activities and the number of active projects, which typically vary from period to period.
OTHER INCOME, NET
- Other
income, net increased by $1,266,582, or 939.4%, to $1,401,415 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from $134,833 for the corresponding
period of 2021. The increase was primarily due to the gain from the favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates in FTI and the
forgiven liabilities of approximately $1.1 million and $165,000, respectively.
SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 COMPARED TO
SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021
NET SALES
- Net sales increased
by $11,926,934, or 230.9%, to $17,092,583 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $5,165,649 for the corresponding period of 2021.
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, net sales by geographic regions, consisting of North America and Asia, were $17,057,585 (99.8%
of net sales) and $34,998 (0.2% of net sales), respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2021, net sales by geographic regions,
consisting of North America, the countries in the Caribbean and South America, and Asia, were $4,456,048 (86.3% of net sales), $2,375
(0.0% of net sales), and $707,226 (13.7% of net sales), respectively.
Net
sales in North America increased by $12,601,537, or 282.8%, to $17,057,585 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $4,456,048
for the corresponding period of 2021. The increase in net sales in North America was primarily due to the demands for two newly launched
wireless products from two major carrier customers, which did not purchase our products during the corresponding period of 2021. Net sales
in the Caribbean and South America decreased by $2,375, or 100.0%, to $0 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $2,375 for the
corresponding period of 2021. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to the general nature of sales in these regions, which often
fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of orders placed by a relatively small number of customers. Net sales
in Asia decreased by $672,228, or 95.1%, to $34,998 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $707,226 for the corresponding period
of 2021. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to the one-time revenue generated from the material sales by FTI for the corresponding
prior period, which typically vary from period to period.
GROSS PROFIT –
Gross
profit decreased by $1,682,960, or 196.4%, to $2,539,904 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $856,944 for the corresponding
period of 2021. The gross profit in terms of net sales percentage was 14.9% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 16.6%
for the corresponding period of 2021. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the change in net sales as described above. The
decrease in gross profit and gross profit in terms of net sales percentage was the mixed results of competitive selling prices and the
increase in production costs of the two newly launched products, and the revenues generated from material sales by FTI, which involved
lower margins, and the revenues generated from existing products sales with higher margins for the six months ended December 31, 2022.
OPERATING EXPENSES
–
Operating expenses increased by $290,487, or 6.9%, to $4,522,137 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $4,231,650 for the corresponding
period of 2021.
Selling, general, and administrative
expenses increased by $472,993 to $2,575,602 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from $2,102,609 for the corresponding period
of 2021. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to the increased payroll expenses, compensation
expenses related to stock options granted for employees, and commission expense for sales of approximately $220,000, $168,000, and $75,000,
respectively. Research and development expense decreased by $182,506 to $1,946,535 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, from $2,129,041
for the corresponding period of 2021. The decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to the mix of the timing of research
and development activities and the number of active projects, which typically vary from period to period.

OTHER INCOME, NET
–
Other income, net increased by $219,998, or 82.3%, to $487,355 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 from $267,357 for the corresponding
period of 2021. The increase was primarily due to the gain from the forgiven liabilities and the increased interest income of approximately
$165,000 and $119,000, respectively, which was partially offset by the decreased product development funding received by FTI from a government
entity of approximately $60,000.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our historical operating results,
capital resources and financial position, in combination with current projections and estimates, were considered in management’s
plan and intentions to fund our operations over a reasonable period of time, which we define as the twelve-month period ending from the
date of the filing of this Form 10-Q. For purposes of liquidity disclosures, we assess the likelihood that we have sufficient available
working capital and other principal sources of liquidity to fund our operating activities and obligations as they become due.
Our principal source of liquidity
as of December 31, 2022 consisted of cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term investments of $34,534,707.  We believe we have
sufficient available capital to cover our existing operations and obligations through at least one year from the date of the filing of
this Form 10-Q.  Our long-term future cash requirements will depend on numerous factors, including our revenue base, profit margins,
product development activities, market acceptance of our products, future expansion plans and ability to control costs.  If we are
unable to achieve our current business plan or secure additional funding that may be required, we would need to curtail our operations
or take other similar actions outside the ordinary course of business in order to continue to operate as a going concern.
OPERATING ACTIVITIES
–
Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $7,187,190 and $8,435,836, respectively.
The $7,187,190 in net cash used
in operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable and inventories
of $6,773,361 and $3,191,635, respectively, as well as our operating results (net loss adjusted for depreciation, amortization, and other
non-cash charges), which was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $3,771,831. The $8,435,836 in net cash used by operating
activities for the six months ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the decrease in accounts payable of $6,189,648 and increase
in inventories of $947,842 as well as our operating results (net loss adjusted for depreciation, amortization, and other non-cash charges),
which was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $1,345,644.
INVESTING ACTIVITIES
–
Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $1,393,764 and $479,169, respectively.
The $1,393,764 in net cash used
in investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the payments for capitalized product development
of $1,046,980 and purchase of short-term investment of $293,545. The $479,169 in net cash used in investing activities for the six months
ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the payments for capitalized product development of $453,689.
FINANCING ACTIVITIES
–
Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $134,000 and $21,595, respectively.
The $134,000 and $21,595 in net
cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were from cash received from exercise of stock
options.

a non-cancelable operating lease that will expire on September 4, 2023.

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION
On November 10, 2022 the Company
and OC Kim, its President, entered into an amendment of the employment letter agreement dated September 7, 2021. The amendment provides
for a severance payment of $3 million if Mr. Kim voluntarily terminates his employment by the Company or if he voluntarily terminates
his employment due to a “change in circumstances,” generally defined as a material breach by the Company of its salary and
benefit obligations or a significant reduction in Mr. Kim’s title or responsibilities. In the case of a termination of employment
by the Company for cause (generally defined as conviction of a felony, or a misdemeanor where imprisonment is imposed, commission of any
act of theft, fraud, dishonesty, or material falsification of any employment or Company records, or improper disclosure of the Company's
confidential or proprietary information), the Company is to make a severance payment of $1,500,000. In either case, any unvested options
become immediately vested.
In the amendment, Mr. Kim also
agrees that, for a period of two years after termination, he will not disparage the Company or its officers, solicit any of its employees
to terminate their employment, or disclose any of the Company’s proprietary information.
In addition, the amendment provides
for the payment of an incentive bonus to Mr. Kim of $125,000 for each calendar quarter during the remaining four-year term of the employment
letter, with the first such bonus due on December 31, 2022.
