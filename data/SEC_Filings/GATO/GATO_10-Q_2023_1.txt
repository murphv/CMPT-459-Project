PSUs were granted to the Company’s employees with a weighted average grant date fair value per share of $ 14.22 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2022,

10.88 ​ ​ 7. Net Income (Loss) per Share Basic net income per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed similarly, except that weighted-average common shares is increased to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if stock options were exercised or PSUs and DSUs were converted into common stock. The dilutive effects are calculated using the treasury stock method. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, all stock options have been excluded from the dilutive earnings per common share calculation as the exercise price of these stock options was greater than the average market value of our common stock for those periods, resulting in an anti-dilutive effect. Additionally, for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, all PSUs were excluded from the diluted earnings per common share calculation as the PSUs do not currently meet the criteria for issuance. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company experienced a net loss, thus all stock options and DSUs outstanding have been excluded as they are anti-dilutive. 9

Fair Value Measurements The Company establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities in the form of a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs into valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. This hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Further, financial assets and liabilities should be classified by level in their entirety based upon the lowest level of input that was significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1:
Unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. Level 2:
Quoted prices in inactive markets for identical assets or liabilities, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or other observable inputs either directly related to the asset or liability or derived principally from corroborated observable market data. Level 3:
Unobservable inputs due to the fact there is little or no market activity. This entails using assumptions in models which estimate what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis The Company discloses and recognizes its non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis and makes adjustments to fair value, as needed (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).
The Company recorded its initial investment in affiliates at fair value within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as the valuation was determined based on internally developed assumptions with few observable inputs and no market activity. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded impairment charges associated with the investment in the LGJV and reduced the carrying amount of such the investment in affiliate to its estimated fair value. ​ 9. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees In determining its accruals and disclosures with respect to loss contingencies, the Company will charge to income an estimated loss if information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal expenses associated with the commitments and contingencies are expensed as incurred. If a loss contingency is not probable or reasonably estimable, disclosure of the loss contingency is made in the financial statements when it is at least reasonably possible that a material loss could be incurred. 10
Table of Contents Environmental Contingencies The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws, regulations and permits governing the protection of the environment. These laws, regulations and permits are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws, regulations and permits, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. Legal On February 22, 2022, a purported Gatos stockholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against the Company, certain of our former officers, and several directors. An amended complaint was filed on August 15, 2022. The amended complaint, allegedly brought on behalf of certain purchasers of Gatos common stock and certain traders of call and put options on Gatos common stock from December 9, 2020 through January 25, 2022, seeks, among other things, damages, costs, and expenses, and asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as well as Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. The amended complaint alleges that certain individual defendants and Gatos, pursuant to the control and authority of the individual defendants, made false and misleading statements and/or omitted certain material information regarding the mineral resources and reserves at the Cerro Los Gatos mine. Gatos and all defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action on October 14, 2022. That motion was fully briefed as of December 23, 2022.
By Notice of Action issued February 9, 2022 and subsequent Statement of Claim dated March 11, 2022 Izabela Przybylska commenced a putative class action against Gatos Silver, Inc. (“Gatos”), certain of its former officers and directors, and others in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on behalf of a purported class of all persons or entities, wherever they may reside or be domiciled, who acquired securities of Gatos in both the primary and secondary markets during the period from October 28, 2020 until January 25, 2022. The action asserts claims under Canadian securities legislation and at common law and seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief in respect of allegations the defendants made false and misleading statements and omitted material information regarding the mineral resources and reserves of Gatos. The plaintiff filed motion materials for leave to proceed in respect of her statutory claims and for class certification on March 3, 2023. The court has tentatively set dates in late March of 2024 for the hearing of the plaintiff’s motions. There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing matters individually or in aggregate will not result in outcomes that are materially adverse for us. Dowa Debt Agreements In July 2017, the LGJV operating entities consisting of Minera Plata Real S. de R.L. de C.V (“MPR”) and Operaciones San Jose del Plata S. de R.L. de C.V. (collectively, the “LGJV Entities”) entered into a loan agreement (the “Term Loan”) with Dowa whereby the LGJV Entities could borrow up to $ 210,000
for Los Gatos District (“LGD”) development, with a maturity date of December 29, 2027. Interest on the Term Loan accrued daily at LIBOR plus
2.35 % per annum, with the interest added to the amount borrowed until commencement of production. During 2018, the LGJV paid Dowa a $ 4,200
closing fee. Commencing June 30, 2021, repayment of the Term Loan in
14
consecutive semi-annual equal payments of the aggregate principal and capitalized interest began. The Company was required to pay an arrangement fee on the borrowing, calculated as
2 % per annum of
70 % of the outstanding principal balance, payable in semi-annual installments, on that date which was
two
business days prior to June 30 and December 31 each fiscal year until maturity, commencing after the initial drawdown which occurred in July 2018. The Term Loan also required additional principal payments equal to
70 % of excess cash flows (as defined).
On July 26, 2021, the Term Loan was repaid in full through capital contributions made to the LGJV by the Company and Dowa in pro-rata amounts equal to their ownership in the LGJV of
70 % and
30 %, respectively. In conjunction with the repayment, the Company paid a fee to Dowa of $ 10,000 , which is recorded on the statements of operations under other income (expense). On January 23, 2018, the LGJV entered into a loan agreement with Dowa (the “Dowa MPR Loan”) whereby the LGJV could borrow up to $ 65,700
to continue LGD development. Interest on this loan accrued daily at LIBOR plus
1.5 % per annum and was added to the amount borrowed. The amount borrowed plus accrued interest was due the earlier of June 30, 2019, or upon the Cerro Los Gatos mine’s substantial completion. If the Company’s
70 % portion of the Dowa MPR Loan was not repaid in full on or before the due date, Dowa could elect to convert all or a portion of the principal amount into additional LGJV ownership at a favorable conversion rate.
11
Table of Contents In connection with entering into the WCF (as defined below), the Company contributed $ 18,200
to the LGJV in May 2019 to provide funding for partial repayment of principal and interest related to the Dowa MPR Loan. In late May 2019, the Dowa MPR Loan was fully extinguished with a cash payment of $ 18,200
and the conversion of the remaining $ 50,737
of principal and interest. The conversion of the remaining principal and interest increased Dowa’s ownership in the LGJV entities by
18.5 % to
48.5 %. On March 11, 2021, the Company repurchased the
18.5 % interest from Dowa, for a total consideration of $ 71,550 , increasing the Company’s ownership in the LGJV to
70.0 %. These transactions resulted in a $ 47,400
higher basis than the underlying net assets of the LGJV Entities. This basis difference is being amortized as the LGJV Entities’ proven and probable reserves are processed. On May 30, 2019, the LGJV entered into a working capital facility agreement (the “WCF”) with Dowa whereby the LGJV could borrow up to $ 60,000
to fund the working capital and sustaining capital requirements of the LGD. Interest on this loan accrued daily at LIBOR plus
3.0 % per annum and all outstanding principal and interest was to mature on June 28, 2021. The Company was required to pay an arrangement fee on the borrowing, calculated as
15.0 % per annum of
70.0 % of the average daily principal amount outstanding under the WCF during such fiscal quarter. On March 11, 2021, the $ 60,000
outstanding under the WCF was extinguished using funds contributed to the LGJV. The Company’s pro-rata capital contribution to the LGJV was $ 42,000 .
The Company guarantees the payment of all obligations, including accrued interest, under the LGJV equipment loan agreements. As of September 30, 2022, the LGJV had $ 1,195
outstanding under the LGJV equipment loan agreements, net of unamortized debt discount of $ 3 , with maturity dates through August 2023. ​ 10. Debt On July 12, 2021, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Facility (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility provides for a revolving line of credit in a principal amount of $ 50,000
and has an accordion feature which at the time allowed for an increase in the total line of credit up to $ 100,000 , subject to certain conditions. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to either the LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from
3.00 % to
4.00 % or the U.S. Base Rate plus a margin ranging from
2.00 % to
3.00 %, as selected by the Company, in each case, with such margin determined in accordance with the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio as of the end of the applicable period. The Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for credit agreements of this nature. The affirmative covenants consist of a leverage ratio, a liquidity covenant and an interest coverage ratio. The negative covenants include, among other things, limitations on asset sales, mergers, acquisitions, indebtedness, liens, dividends and distributions, investments and transactions with affiliates. Obligations under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain customary events of default. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility, as amended, as of March 31, 2022. On July 19, 2021, the Company borrowed $ 13,000
under the Credit Facility at a rate of LIBOR plus
3 %. Debt issuance costs of $ 442
were to be amortized through July 31, 2024, prior to the amended and restated Credit Facility (see terms below). The current balance outstanding on the Credit Facility is $ 9,000 , following a $ 4,000
principal repayment in December 2022. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized interest expense of $ 142
and $ 368 , respectively, with an effective interest rate of 4.4% and 3.8%, respectively, which has been recorded on the statements of operations under other income (expense), and $ 36
and $ 110 , respectively, for amortization of debt issuance costs. The Company paid interest of $ 158
and $ 385
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. On March 7, 2022, the Company amended the Credit Facility with the lender, Bank of Montreal (“BMO”), to address potential loan covenant deficiencies. The amendment included the following revisions: ● audited financial statements were to be provided prior to November 15, 2022; ● the credit limit was reduced to
$ 30,000 , until the Company delivered a new LOM CLG financial model with updated mineral reserves; ● upon assessment of the new CLG financial model, BMO, in its sole discretion, could increase the credit limit up to the original
$ 50,000 ;
● requirement to provide updated financial projections for the CLG by September 30, 2022. The financial projections were provided by the required date and were used as the basis for the amendment entered into on December 19, 2022 discussed below; and ● waivers of certain defaults, events of default, representations and warranties and covenants arising out of the facts that led to the potential reduction in metal content of the Company’s previously stated mineral reserve figures. 12
Table of Contents On December 19, 2022, the Company entered an amended and restated Credit Facility with BMO extending the maturity date and re-establishing a credit limit of $ 50,000 , with an accordion feature providing up to an additional $ 25,000 . Key terms of the amended Credit Facility include: ● audited financial statements for fiscal year 2021 are to be provided no later than April 15, 2023, and audited financial statements for fiscal year 2022 and unaudited financial statements for the first three fiscal quarters in fiscal year 2022 are to be provided no later than April 30, 2023; ● the maturity date is extended from July 31, 2024 to December 31, 2025; ● a change in the benchmark interest rate from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”); and ● loans under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to either a term SOFR rate plus a margin ranging from
3.00 %
to
4.00 %
or a U.S. base rate plus a margin ranging from
2.00 %
to
3.00 % , as selected by the Company. ​ ​ 11.

and $ 1,600
of income, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $ 32,180
and $ 22,592
of income, respectively, on its investment in the LGJV Entities, representing its ownership share of the LGJV Entities’ results. The equity income or loss in affiliate includes amortization of the carrying value of the investment in excess of the underlying net assets of the LGJV Entities. This basis difference is being amortized as the LGJV Entities’ proven and probable reserves are processed. The Company provided an updated technical report compliant with Regulation S-K subpart 1300 (the “Los Gatos Technical Report”) dated November 10, 2022. The Los Gatos Technical Report indicated a significant decrease in the mineral reserve and mineral resource from the previously issued technical report in 2020. The Company considered this reduction in the mineral reserve and mineral resources as an indicator of a possible other-than-temporary impairment and as a result compared the carrying value of the LGJV on December 31, 2021 to the fair value of the LGJV. 13
Table of Contents The fair value of the LGJV was estimated based on the net present value of the expected cash flows to be generated by the LGJV on
70 % basis. The discount rate used was
5.00 %. The fair value of the investment in the LGJV was estimated to be $ 355,310
and the carrying value at December 31, 2021 was $ 406,874 . Since the carrying value exceeded the fair value, an impairment charge of $ 51,564
was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2021. See Note 8 - Fair Value Measurements for additional detail of the assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the long-lived assets tested for impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company contributed $ 260,039
to the LGJV to repurchase
18.5 % of the ownership of the LGJV, to retire the WCF and the Term Loan and in support of exploration activities. On March 17, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement with Dowa to build and operate a leaching plant to reduce fluorine levels in zinc concentrates produced at CLG at an expected construction cost of $ 6,000 . As part of the agreement, the initial payment of the $ 20,000
due to Dowa under the partner’s priority distribution agreement was reduced to $ 10,300 . The reduced priority dividend amount reflects a portion of both the construction and future estimated operating costs of the leaching plant and is dependent on the successful construction and operation of the leaching plant. Should the leaching plant construction not be completed, or the leaching plant not operate according to certain parameters during the first five years, portions of the $ 9,700
reduction could be reinstated. In April 2022, the LGJV paid its first dividend of $ 20,000
to its partners. The Company’s share of the first dividend was $ 14,000 , before withholding taxes of $ 700 . A payment of $ 7,365
was subsequently made to Dowa to cover the full amount of the reduced initial priority distribution due, for a net dividend received of $ 5,935 . In July 2022 the LGJV paid an additional dividend in the amount of $ 15,000
to its partners. The Company’s share, after withholding taxes of $ 525
was $ 9,975 . The LGJV Entities combined balance sheets as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and the combined statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, are as follows: ​ 14

Overview We are a Canadian headquartered, Delaware incorporated precious metals exploration, development and production company with the objective of becoming a leading silver producer. Our primary efforts are focused on the operation of the LGJV in Chihuahua, Mexico. The LGJV was formed on January 1, 2015 when we entered into the Unanimous Omnibus Partner Agreement with Dowa to further explore, and potentially develop and operate mining properties within the LGD. The LGJV Entities own certain surface and mineral rights associated with the LGD. The LGJV ownership is currently 70% Gatos Silver and 30% Dowa. On September 1, 2019, the LGJV commenced commercial production at CLG, which produces a silver containing lead concentrate and zinc concentrate. We are currently focused on the production and continued development of the CLG and the further exploration and development of the LGD. Third Quarter 2022 Highlights Gatos Silver Third Quarter and Year to date ● The Company recorded net income of $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to a net loss of $15.0 million in the same period of the prior year as a result of higher equity income from affiliates earned during the third quarter of 2021 and a $10.0 million fee paid to Dowa in 2021;
● The Company recorded net income of $18.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to a net loss of $3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to $9.6 million increase in equity income from the LGJV and a $9.9 million change in other income (expense) primarily due to a $10.0 million fee paid to Dowa in 2021; and ● The cash balance at September 30, 2022 was $15.3 million compared to $6.6 million at December 31, 2021, and access to the Credit Facility was maintained albeit at a reduced level. On December 19, 2022, the Credit Facility was extended and the availability under the Credit Facility has been restored. 18

General and administrative expenses During the three months ended September 30, 2022, we incurred general and administration expense of $5.9 million compared to $7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The $1.3 million decrease is primarily due to a $1.6 million decrease in shared-based compensation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. Equity income in affiliates
The increase in equity income resulted primarily from the LGJV recording net income of $12.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to $5.5 million for the same period in 2021. The increase in net income at the LGJV was primarily due to the increase in concentrate sold reflecting increased production and higher zinc prices.
20
Table of Contents Other income (expense) The $9.9 million change in other income (expense) for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2021, was mainly due to a $10.0 million fee paid to Dowa in conjunction with the Term Loan repayment in 2021. Net income (loss) For the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we recorded net income of $1.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $15.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. The change was mainly due to the increase in equity income in affiliates and the 2021 payment of a $10.0 million fee to Dowa as described above. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 Exploration expenses During 2022, our exploration activities were focused on the LGJV and no exploration costs were incurred for our wholly owned properties outside of the first quarter of 2022.
General and administrative expenses During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we incurred general and administration expense of $17.0 million compared to $17.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to lower share-based compensation expense of $3.7 million and $0.7 million of separation costs for a departing executive officer partially offset by increased legal fees of $3.3 million attributable to legal consultation regarding the mineral resource and mineral reserve errors in the July 2020 technical report for CLG. Equity income in affiliates
The increase in equity income resulted primarily from the LGJV recording net income of $53.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $41.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in net income at the LGJV was primarily due to the increase in concentrates sold, higher grades, and higher realized metals prices for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021.
Other income (expense) The $9.9 million change in other income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021, was mainly due to a $10.0 million fee paid to Dowa in conjunction with the Term Loan repayment in 2021. Net income (loss) For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded net income of $18.3 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $3.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The change was mainly due to the increase in equity income in affiliates and fee paid to Dowa as described above. ​ 21

73,926 ​ $
56,991 ​ Revenue increased by 30% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021, as a result of increased concentrate sales, increased realized zinc prices and positive market-to-market adjustments included in provisional revenue adjustments in the three months ended September 30, 2022 partially offset by lower realized lead and silver prices.
Lead concentrate revenue increased by 18% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to an 11% increase in lead concentrate production and higher silver and lead recoveries, partially offset by an 11% decrease in the realized lead prices and a 15% decrease in the realized silver price. Zinc concentrate revenue increased by 7% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to a 13% increase in the realized zinc price and a 30% increase in zinc concentrate production, partially offset by a lower silver and zinc recoveries and a 15% decrease in the realized silver price.
Provisional revenue adjustments account for commodity price fluctuations in concentrate sales still subject to final settlement. Provisional revenue adjustments increased period over period primarily due to increases in metals prices at the end of Q3 2022 as compared to the beginning of the period, compared to the end of Q3 2021 due to a decrease in volume subject to final settlement and lower silver prices, partially offset by a slight increase in zinc and lead prices over this period. Cost of sales Cost of sales increased by 9% primarily as a result of an increase in processed tonnes, and increased equipment maintenance costs, cost of materials & supplies and higher power costs. Co-product cash cost per ounce of payable silver equivalent and by-product cash cost per ounce of payable silver decreased by 27% and 11%, to $8.88 and $3.20, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2022.
Royalties Royalty expense decreased by $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 due to a reduction of the royalty percentage on revenue based on the contractual terms. General and administrative
The amount of general and administrative expense for Q3 2022 was consistent with the expenditure incurred during Q3 2021.
23
Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense increased by approximately 57% quarter over quarter primarily as a result of an increase in tonnes mined and also due to the decrease in the mineral reserve and the shorter mine life based on the Los Gatos Technical Report dated November 10, 2022 which reduced the basis for depreciation.
Exploration Exploration expense for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $0.3 million higher as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 primarily as a result of increased surface drilling around CLG exploration targets. The dominant focus for drilling was at CLG aiming to convert Inferred Resources to Indicated and also to expand the Inferred Resource base, particularly in the South-East Deeps area. Other expense Other expense was lower primarily due to an 88% decrease in interest expense as a result of lower interest rates, lower borrowings and lower arrangement fees incurred during Q3 2022 compared to Q3 2021 which was impacted by the retirement of the WCF and the Term Loan in March 2021 and July 2021, respectively, and the $4.4 million loss incurred in Q3 2021 on the Term Loan extinguishment.
Income and mining tax expense Income and mining tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $5.8 million higher as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 as a result of increased taxable income and reduced losses carried forward. Net Income
For the three months ended September 30, 2022, the LGJV had net income of $12.6 million compared to $5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The change in net income was primarily due to increased production and higher zinc prices for the three months ended September 30, 2022, partially offset by lower realized silver and lead prices, as well as an increase in cost of sales and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs and increased income and mining taxes. In addition, interest expense decreased 88% due to lower borrowings and lower arrangement fees resulting from the retirement of the WCF and Term Loan and the $4.4 million loss incurred in Q3 2021 on the Term Loan extinguishment. Sustaining capital expenditures
During the three months ended September 30, 2022 sustaining capital expenditures primarily consisted of $7.1 million on mine development, $4.3 million on the construction of the paste-fill plant, $2.3 million on the construction of the raise of the tailings storage facility, $0.4 million on underground power distribution infrastructure and $0.3 million on the construction of a ventilation raise. During the three months ended September 30, 2021 major sustaining capital expenditures included $7.1 million on mine development, $3.8 million on the processing plant and tailings storage facility, $1.1 million for the construction of a ventilation raise, $0.8 million for the purchase of mining equipment, $2.2 million on underground power distribution infrastructure and $2.9 million on the construction of dewatering wells.

178,326 ​ Revenue increased by 23% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30 2021. The increase in revenue is primarily due to an increase in lead and zinc concentrate sales as a result of higher production partially offset by a negative market-to-market adjustment included in provisional revenue.
Lead concentrate revenue increased by 13% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to an 17% increase in lead concentrate production and higher silver recoveries, partially offset by an 1% decrease in the realized lead prices, a 26% decrease in the realized silver price and slightly lower lead recoveries. Zinc concentrate revenue increased by 48% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to a 18% increase in the realized zinc price and a 27% increase in zinc concentrate production, partially offset by a lower silver and zinc recoveries and a 26% decrease in the realized silver price.
Provisional revenue adjustments account for commodity price fluctuations in concentrate sales still subject to final settlement. Provisional revenue adjustments were lower period over period primarily due to decreases in metals prices at the end of Q3 2022 as compared to the beginning of the period, compared to the end of Q3 2021 due to a decrease in silver prices over that period partially offset by price increases in lead and zinc over this period. Cost of sales Cost of sales increased by 16% primarily as a result of an increase in production and increased equipment maintenance, materials and supplies and power costs. Co-product cash cost per ounce of payable silver equivalent and by-product cash cost per ounce of payable silver decreased by 27% and 77%, to $9.25 and $1.24, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Royalties Royalty expense decreased by $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to a reduction of the royalty percentage on revenue based on the contractual terms in 2022 partially offset by increased revenue resulting primarily from increased production and higher zinc and lead prices. General and administrative
General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was 4% higher as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to inflation.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense increased by approximately 44% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily as a result of an increase in tonnes mined and also due to

Exploration Exploration expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $2.7 million higher as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily as a result of increased surface drilling around CLG, Esther and greenfield exploration targets. The dominant focus for drilling was at CLG aiming to convert Inferred Resources to Indicated and also to expand the Inferred Resource base, particularly in the South-East Deeps area. Other (income) expense Other (income) expense were lower primarily due to a 93% decrease in interest expense due to lower interest rates, lower borrowings and lower arrangement fees incurred during nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as a result of the retirement of the WCF and the Term Loan in March 2021 and July 2021, respectively, and the $4.4 million loss incurred in Q3 2021 on the Term Loan extinguishment.
Income and mining tax expense Income and mining tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $12.0 million higher as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as a result of increased taxable income and reduced losses carried forward. Net Income
For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the LGJV had net income of $53.0 million compared to $41.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The change in net income was primarily due to the increase in revenue driven by the strong improvement in production during 2022, partially offset by an increase in cost of sales, exploration and depreciation, depletion and amortization and increased income and mining taxes. In addition, interest expense decreased 93% due to lower borrowings and lower arrangement fees resulting from the retirement of the WCF and Term Loan and the $4.4 million loss incurred in Q3 2021 on the Term Loan extinguishment. Sustaining capital expenditures
During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, sustaining capital expenditures primarily consisted of $21.7 million of mine development, $17.9 million on the construction of the paste-fill plant, $8.1 million on the construction of the raise of the tailings storage facility, $2.0 million on underground power distribution infrastructure and $1.7 million on the construction of a ventilation raise. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, major sustaining capital expenditures included $21.6 million of mine development, $8.2 million on the processing plant and tailings storage facility, $2.4 million for the construction of a ventilation raise, $3.0 million for the purchase of mining equipment, $4.3 million on underground power distribution infrastructure and $6.3 million on the construction of dewatering wells. 26

Nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to September 30, 2021 Cash provided by (used by) operating activities was $16.0 million and ($15.5) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $31.5 million increase in cash was primarily due to receipt of $23.3 million of dividends from the LGJV and the 2021 payment of a $10.0 million fee to Dowa, partially offset by working capital changes. Cash used by investing activities was ($7.4) million and ($261.4) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash used by investing activities for the for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to the priority distribution payment made to Dowa. Cash used for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, was primarily due to the $71.6 million acquisition of the 18.5% interest in the LGJV from Dowa, the $42.0 million pro-rata capital contribution to the LGJV for the extinguishment of the WCF in March 2021 and the $144.8 million capital contribution to the LGJV to retire the Dowa Term Loan in July 2021.
Cash provided by financing activities was nil and $139.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash provided for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily related to the $4.2 million in proceeds from the follow-on offering of stock in July 2021 and the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options.

Table of Contents Nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to September 30, 2021 Cash provided by operating activities was $118.3 million and $85.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $33.3 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the increase in revenue due to increased production and higher zinc and lead prices for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the prior year period, partially offset by increased income taxes, receivables from customers and other favorable working capital changes. Cash used by investing activities was $61.9 million and $57.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $4.2 million increase in cash used was primarily due to $13.3 million of higher expenditures for property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $8.8 million of lower mine development expenditures. The majority of property, plant and equipment expenditures in 2022 are related to construction of the paste plant and continued construction of the tailings dam raise. Cash used by financing activities was $38.0 million and $19.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $19.0 million increase in cash used was primarily due to $33 million of dividends paid to partners partially offset by $13.5 million of capital contributions received in 2021 in excess of the $15.9 million paid on the Term Loan in June 2021, the $60.0 million paid to extinguish the Working Capital Facility and the $144.9 million paid to retire the Dowa Term Loan.
Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $15.3 million and $6.6 million, respectively. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to receipt of the dividend payments in April 2022 and July 2022 of $5.9 million and $10.0 million, respectively, partially offset by operating costs.
On July 12, 2021, the Company entered into the Credit Facility that provides for a $50 million revolving line of credit and has an accordion feature, which allows for an increase in the total line of credit up to $100.0 million (reduced to $75 million per the December 19, 2022 amendment), subject to certain conditions. As of September 30, 2022, $13.0 million was outstanding under the Credit Facility. As of the date of this report the balance outstanding on the Credit Facility is $9.0 million following a $4.0 million principal repayment in December 2022.
On February 28, 2023 the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were $15.6 million and we had $41.0 million available to be drawn under the Credit Facility. The LGJV had cash and cash equivalents of $55.5 million at February 28, 2023. We believe we have sufficient cash and access to borrowings and other resources to carry out our business plans for at least the next 12 months. We may decide to increase our current financial resources with external financings if our long-term business needs require us to do so however there can be no assurance that the financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We manage liquidity risk through our credit facility and the management of our capital structure. Contractual Obligations There have been no changes from the contractual obligations described in our 2021 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies Please refer to Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements included in this Report and the 2021 10-K for discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”) permits us, as an “emerging growth company,” to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to “opt out” of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for public companies that are not emerging growth companies. The decision to opt out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act is irrevocable. 28
Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use certain measures that are not defined by GAAP to evaluate various aspects of our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Please see “ Cash Costs and All-In Sustaining Costs” and
“Reconciliation of expenses (GAAP) to non-GAAP measures ” below. Cash Costs and All-In Sustaining Costs Cash costs and all-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) are non-GAAP measures. AISC was calculated based on guidance provided by the World Gold Council (“WGC”). WGC is not a regulatory industry organization and does not have the authority to develop accounting standards for disclosure requirements. Other mining companies may calculate AISC differently as a result of differences in underlying accounting principles and policies applied, as well as definitional differences of sustaining versus expansionary (i.e. non-sustaining) capital expenditures based upon each company’s internal policies. Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of sales, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. Therefore, we believe that cash costs and AISC are non-GAAP measures that provide additional information to management, investors and analysts that aid in the understanding of the economics of the Company’s operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production.
Cash costs include all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing metals, including mining, processing and other plant costs, treatment and refining costs, general and administrative costs, royalties and mining production taxes. AISC includes total production cash costs incurred at the LGJV’s mining operations plus sustaining capital expenditures. The Company believes this measure represents the total sustainable costs of producing silver from current operations and provides additional information of the LGJV’s operational performance and ability to generate cash flows. As the measure seeks to reflect the full cost of silver production from current operations, new project and expansionary capital at current operations are not included. Certain cash expenditures such as new project spending, tax payments, dividends, and financing costs are not included.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide disclosure pursuant to this Item. 30
Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2022, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described in the 2021 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect resource constraints, which require management to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management’s override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. ​ 31
Table of Contents PART II – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.  Legal Proceedings We are, from time to time, involved in legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to our business. We believe that other than as set out below in this Item none of the litigation in which we are currently involved, or have been involved since the beginning of our most recently completed financial year, individually or in the aggregate, is material to or potentially material to our consolidated financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.
On February 22, 2022, a purported Company stockholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against the Company, certain of our former officers, and several directors. An amended complaint was filed on August 15, 2022. The amended complaint, allegedly brought on behalf of certain purchasers of the Company’s common stock and certain traders of call and put options on the Company’s common stock from December 9, 2020 through January 25, 2022, seeks, among other things, damages, costs, and expenses, and asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as well as Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. The amended complaint alleges that certain individual defendants and the Company, pursuant to the control and authority of the individual defendants, made false and misleading statements and/or omitted certain material information regarding the mineral resources and reserves at the Cerro Los Gatos mine. The Company and all defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action on October 14, 2022. That motion was fully briefed as of December 23, 2022.
By Notice of Action issued February 9, 2022 and subsequent Statement of Claim dated March 11, 2022 Izabela Przybylska commenced a putative class action against the Company, certain of its former officers and directors, and others in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on behalf of a purported class of all persons or entities, wherever they may reside or be domiciled, who acquired securities of the Company in both the primary and secondary markets during the period from October 28, 2020 until January 25, 2022. The action asserts claims under Canadian securities legislation and at common law and seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief in respect of allegations the defendants made false and misleading statements and omitted material information regarding the mineral resources and reserves of the Company. The plaintiff filed motion materials for leave to proceed in respect of her statutory claims and for class certification on March 3, 2023. The court has tentatively set dates in late March of 2024 for the hearing of the plaintiff’s motions. There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing matters individually or in aggregate will not result in outcomes that are materially adverse for us. Item 1A. Risk Factors Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Report include, but are not limited to, any of the risks described in the 2021 10-K. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect us. As of the date of this Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the 2021 10-K. 32
