GLOBESTAR THERAPEUTICS CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2022
(Unaudited)
Note 1.
General Organization and Business
GlobeStar Therapeutics Corporation (the “Company”)
was incorporated on April 29, 2016. The Company’s year-end is September 30. On October 4, 2019, the Company filed Articles of Continuance
with the Secretary of State of Wyoming to continue its business in the state of Wyoming. As part of these Articles of Continuance, effective
October 4, 2019, the Company has no limit on the authorized shares of common stock that can be issued. The Company filed its Certificate
of Dissolution with the Secretary of State of Nevada on October 21, 2019 because it is no longer a Nevada corporation.
The Company is developing an expanded platform of
products that include addition of treatment for Multiple Sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. The potential pharmaceutical
products related to treatment for multiple sclerosis are licensed to the Company through the worldwide licensing agreement described in
Note 6.
Note 2.
Going Concern and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a net loss of
$ 165,909
and cash flow used in operating activities of $ 39,142 . As of December 31, 2022, the Company had negative working capital of $ 1,237,566 .
Management does not anticipate having positive cash flow from operations in the near future. The Company has minimal revenue. Without
additional capital, the Company will not be able to remain in business.
These factors raise a substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that
may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
Management has plans to address the Company’s
financial situation as follows:
In the near term, management plans to continue to
focus on raising the funds necessary to implement the Company’s business plan. Management will continue to seek out debt financing
to obtain the capital required to meet the Company’s financial obligations. There is no assurance, however, that lenders will advance
capital to the Company or that the new business operations will be profitable. The possibility of failure in obtaining additional funding
and the potential inability to achieve profitability raise doubts about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
In the long term, management believes that the Company’s
projects and initiatives will be successful and will provide cash flow to the Company, which will be used to finance the Company’s
future growth. However, there can be no assurances that the Company’s planned activities will be successful, or that the Company
will ultimately attain profitability. The Company’s long-term viability depends on its ability to obtain adequate sources of debt
or equity funding to meet current commitments and fund the continuation of its business operations, and the ability of the Company to
achieve adequate profitability and cash flows from operations to sustain its operations.
Interim Financial Statements
The accompanying unaudited financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim
financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and notes thereto for the year ended September 30, 2022 which are included on our Form 10-K filed on January 9, 2023. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position
and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for the three months
ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending September 30, 2023.
Consolidated Financial Statements
The consolidated financial statements of the Company
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, SomaCeuticals, Inc., First Titan Energy, LLC and First Titan Technical,
LLC from the date of their formations or acquisition. Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Update (“ASU”) accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported

or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain
standards are under consideration.

the Company was a wellness company dedicated to bringing innovative, effective and high-quality supplement products to the medical, wellness
and adult-use markets through our marketing subsidiary, SomaCeuticals TM .
Professional Team
We have adopted a Medical Advisory Board and appointed
medical doctors and medical professionals that have extensive education and hands on experience with pharmaceutical and nutraceutical
solution for prevention and treatment of disease.
Management’s Plan to Attract Capital
In the near term, management will utilize equity and
debt financing to complete assembling the professional and management team to commence the process for clinical trials in compliance with
FDA protocol. plans to continue to focus on raising the funds necessary to implement the Company’s business plan. Management will
continue to seek out debt financing to obtain the capital required to meet the Company’s financial obligations. There is no assurance,
however, that lenders will continue to advance capital to the Company or that the new business operations will be profitable. The possibility
of failure in obtaining additional funding and the potential inability to achieve profitability raise doubts about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern.
In the midterm, management will enhance its capital
position with a public offering of equity securities to finance clinical trials and the necessary actions to obtain approval of worldwide
marketing of our MS treatment.
In the long term, marketing the Company’s pharmaceutical
and nutraceutical products will provide the necessary cash flow to support future growth. However, there can be no assurances that the
Company’s planned activities will be successful, or that the Company will ultimately attain profitability. The Company’s long-term
viability depends on its ability to obtain adequate sources of capital to support near term and midterm business operations, and the ability
of the Company to achieve adequate profitability and cash flows from operations to support its operations.
Corporate Governance
We have adopted codes and committees for governance
of the corporation that include: (i) audit committee charter, (ii) written acknowledgement of code of ethics for directors and senior
officers, (iii) compensation committee charter, (iv) confidential information policy, iv) corporate governance guidelines, (vi) executive
committee charter, and (vii) nominating committee charter.
Critical Accounting Policies
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in
conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on
historical experience, current trends, and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated financial
statements are prepared. We regularly review our accounting policies, and how they are applied and disclosed in our consolidated financial
statements.
While we believe that the historical experience, current
trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, actual results
could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2022. Based upon that
evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed by us under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.
1.
As of December 31, 2022, we did not maintain effective controls over the control environment. Specifically, we have not developed and effectively communicated to our employees our accounting policies and procedures. This has resulted in inconsistent practices. Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the organization, management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness.
2.
As of December 31, 2022, we did not maintain effective controls over financial statement disclosure. Specifically, controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements. Accordingly, management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.
Our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent
all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
Change in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal controls over
financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
