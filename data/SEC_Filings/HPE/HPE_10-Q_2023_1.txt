Note 1:
Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Background Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company ("Hewlett Packard Enterprise," "HPE," or the "Company") is a global technology leader focused on developing intelligent solutions that allow customers to capture, analyze and act upon data seamlessly from edge to cloud. Hewlett Packard Enterprise enables customers to accelerate business outcomes by driving new business models, creating new customer and employee experiences, and increasing operational efficiency today and into the future. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's customers range from small- and medium-sized businesses to large global enterprises and governmental entities. Basis of Presentation and Consolidation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with United States ("U.S.") Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). The Company’s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries and affiliates in which the Company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and accounts within the consolidated businesses of the Company have been eliminated. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Hewlett Packard Enterprise contain all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, its results of operations for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, its cash flows for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, and its statements of stockholders' equity for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. The results of operations and the cash flows for the three months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on December 8, 2022. Segment Realignment Effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, in orde r to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure, the Company implemented an organizational change with the transfer of certain storage networking products, previously reported within the Storage reportable segment, to the Compute reportable segment.
The Company reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented, which primarily resulted in the realignment of net revenue and operating profit for each of the segments as described above. These changes had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s previously reported consolidated net revenue, net earnings, net earnings per share ("EPS") or total assets. Significant Accounting Policies There have been no changes to the Company's significant accounting policies described in Part II, Item 8, Note 1, "Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. Recently Enacted Accounting Pronouncements Although there are new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") that the Company will adopt, as applicable, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 10 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 2:

Transformation Programs Transformation programs are comprised of the cost optimization and prioritization plan and the HPE Next initiative. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company launched the cost optimization and prioritization plan, which focuses on realigning the workforce to areas of growth, a new hybrid workforce model called Edge-to-Office, real estate strategies, and simplifying and evolving our product portfolio strategy. The implementation period of the primary elements of the cost optimization and prioritization plan is anticipated to be through fiscal 2023. During the remaining implementation period, the Company expects to incur transformation costs predominantly related to labor restructuring, non-labor restructuring, IT investments, design and execution charges and real estate initiatives. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company launched an initiative called HPE Next to put in place a purpose-built company designed to compete and win in the markets where it participates. Through this program, the Company is simplifying the operating model, and streamlining its offerings, business processes and business systems to improve its strategy execution. The implementation period of primary elements of the HPE Next initiative is anticipated to be through fiscal 2023. During the remaining implementation period, the Company expects to incur predominantly IT infrastructure costs for streamlining, upgrading, and simplifying back-end operations, and real estate initiatives. These costs are expected to be offset by gains from real estate sales and sublease income from inactive office space.

Note 5:
Taxes on Earnings Provision for Taxes For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded income tax expense of $ 122  million and income tax benefit of $ 20  million, respectively, which reflects an effective tax rate of
19.6 % and ( 4.1 )%, respectively. The effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of
21 % due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from the Company’s operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world but are also impacted by discrete tax adjustments during each fiscal period.
For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company recorded $ 11
million of net income tax benefits related to various items discrete to the period. The amount primarily included $ 22
million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, acquisition, disposition and other related charges and $ 13  million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by $ 23  million of net income tax charges related to tax audit settlements and changes in uncertain tax positions.
For the three months ended January 31, 2022, the Company recorded $ 83  million of net income tax benefits related to various items discrete to the period. The amount primarily included $ 43
million of net income tax benefits related to the settlement of U.S. tax audit matters, $ 24  million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs and acquisition, disposition and other related charges, and $ 16
million of net income tax benefits related to the settlement of foreign tax audit matters. Uncertain Tax Positions As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $ 720
million and $ 674
million, respectively, of which up to $ 419
million and $ 386
million, respectively, would affect the Company's effective tax rate if realized as of their respective periods.
For tax liabilities pertaining to unrecognized tax benefits, the Company recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties in (Provision) benefit for taxes in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company recognized interest expense of $ 1  million and interest income of $ 40  million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company recognized interest income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 due to the release of reserves as a result of the effective settlement of the IRS audit for fiscal 2016. As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, the Company had accrued $ 82
million and $ 81
million, respectively, for interest and penalties in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 16 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) The Company engages in continuous discussion and negotiation with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service is conducting an audit of the Company's fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 U.S. federal income tax returns. It is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign, and state tax issues may be concluded in the next
12
months, including issues involving resolution of certain intercompany transactions and other matters. Accordingly, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its existing unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by an amount up to $ 44
million within the next 12 months.

billion and $ 4.1
billion of trade receivables, respectively. The Company recorded an obligation of $ 95  million and $ 88  million within Notes payable and short-term borrowings in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 respectively, related to the trade receivables sold and collected from the third-party for which the revenue recognition was deferred. Contract Liabilities and Remaining Performance Obligations As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, current deferred revenue of $ 3.5
billion and $ 3.4
billion, respectively, were recorded in Deferred revenue, and non-current deferred revenue of $ 3.1

billion of revenue was recognized relating to contract liabilities recorded as of October 31, 2022. 18 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contract work that has not yet been performed and does not include contracts where the customer is not committed. Remaining performance obligations estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including contract terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, adjustments for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency. As of January 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of remaining performance obligations, or deferred revenue, was $ 6.6
billion. The Company expects to recognize approximately
48 % of this balance over fiscal 2023 with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. Costs to Obtain a Contract As of January 31, 2023, the current and non-current portions of the capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $ 77
million and $ 126
million, respectively. As of October 31, 2022, the current and non-current portions of the capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $ 76  million and $ 124  million, respectively. The current and non-current portions of the capitalized costs to obtain a contract were included in Other current assets, and Long-term financing receivables and other assets, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 the Company amortized $ 22
million and $ 20
million respectively, of capitalized costs to obtain a contract. The amortized capitalized costs to obtain a contract are included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Note 7:
Accounting for Leases as a Lessor
Financing receivables represent sales-type and direct-financing leases of the Company and third-party products. These receivables typically have terms ranging from
two
to
five years
and are usually collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Financing receivables also include billed receivables from operating leases. The allowance for credit losses represents future expected credit losses over the life of the receivables based on past experience, current information and forward-looking economic considerations.
The components of financing receivables were as follows:   As of   January 31, 2023 October 31, 2022   In millions Minimum lease payments receivable $ 9,256   $ 8,686   Unguaranteed residual value 407   380   Unearned income ( 804 ) ( 707 ) Financing receivables, gross 8,859   8,359   Allowance for credit losses

During the three months ended January 31, 2023 and the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, the Company sold $ 39  million and $ 183
million of financing receivables, respectively.
Credit Quality Indicators Due to the homogeneous nature of its leasing transactions, the Company manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risk. Credit risk is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic regions. The Company evaluates the credit quality of an obligor at lease inception and monitors that credit quality over the term of a transaction. The Company assigns risk ratings to each lease based on the creditworthiness of the obligor and other variables that augment or mitigate the inherent credit risk of a particular transaction and periodically updates the risk ratings when there is a change in the underlying credit quality. Such variables include the underlying value and liquidity of the collateral, the essential use of the equipment, the term of the lease, and the inclusion of credit enhancements, such as guarantees, letters of credit or security deposits. 19 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) The credit risk profile of gross financing receivables, based on internal risk ratings as of January 31, 2023, presented on amortized cost basis by year of origination was as follows:   As of January 31, 2023 Risk Rating Low Moderate High Fiscal Year In millions 2023 $ 352   $ 215   $ 5   2022 2,273   1,427   48   2021 1,279   1,004   44   2020 662   515   64   2019 and prior 331   485   155   Total $ 4,897   $ 3,646   $ 316   The credit risk profile of gross financing receivables, based on internal risk ratings as of October 31, 2022, presented on amortized cost basis by year of origination was as follows:   As of October 31, 2022 Risk Rating Low Moderate High Fiscal Year In millions 2022 $ 1,987   $ 1,277   $ 44   2021 1,338   1,071   42   2020 756   571   67   2019 328   336   69   2018 and prior 143   234   96   Total $ 4,552   $ 3,489   $ 318   Accounts rated low risk typically have the equivalent of a Standard & Poor's rating of BBB– or higher, while accounts rated moderate risk generally have the equivalent of BB+ or lower. The Company classifies accounts as high risk when it considers the financing receivable to be impaired or when management believes there is a significant near-term risk of impairment. The credit quality indicators do not reflect any mitigation actions taken to transfer credit risk to third parties. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses for financing receivables as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 and the respective changes during the three and twelve months then ended were as follows.
As of   January 31, 2023 October 31, 2022   In millions Balance at beginning of period $ 325   $ 228   Provision for credit losses (1) 18   177   Adjustment to the existing allowance —   ( 10 ) Write-offs ( 10 ) ( 70 ) Balance at end of period $ 333   $ 325   (1)     Fiscal 2022 included a provision of $ 99  million related to expected credit losses due to the Company's exit from its Russia and Belarus businesses. 20 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) Non-Accrual and Past-Due Financing Receivables The following table summarizes the aging and non-accrual status of gross financing receivables:   As of   January 31, 2023 October 31, 2022   In millions Billed: (1)     Current and past due 1-30 days $ 396   $ 372   Past due 31-60 days 45   32   Past due 61-90 days 32   19   Past due > 90 days 148   121   Unbilled sales-type and direct-financing lease receivables 8,238   7,815   Total gross financing receivables $ 8,859   $ 8,359   Gross financing receivables on non-accrual status (2) $ 317   $ 290   Gross financing receivables 90 days past due and still accruing interest (2) $ 76   $ 72   (1) Includes billed operating lease receivables and billed sales-type and direct-financing lease receivables.

The asset-backed debt securities are collateralized by the U.S. fixed-term financing receivables and leased equipment in the offering, which is held by a Special Purpose Entity ("SPE"). The SPE meets the definition of a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE") and is consolidated, along with the associated debt, into the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The SPE is a bankruptcy-remote legal entity with separate assets and liabilities. The purpose of the SPE is to facilitate the funding of customer receivables and leased equipment in the capital markets. The Company’s risk of loss related to securitized receivables and leased equipment is limited to the amount by which the Company’s right to receive collections for assets securitized exceeds the amount required to pay interest, principal, and fees and expenses related to the asset-backed securities. 21 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) The following table presents the assets and liabilities held by the consolidated VIE as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, which are included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The assets in the table below include those that can be used to settle the obligations of the VIE. Additionally, general creditors do not have recourse to the assets of the VIE.

financing receivables and leased equipment were transferred via securitization through the SPE. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, financing receivables and leased equipment transferred via securitization through the SPE were $ 1.6  billion and $ 1.2  billion, respectively. Note 8:
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. As of January 31, 2023, the Company's reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2, with the exception of Corporate Investments and Other, which contains
three
reporting units: A & PS, CMS, and Software.
The following table represents the carrying value of goodwill, by reportable segment as of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022. There has been no change to the accumulated impairment loss from the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.
Compute HPC & AI Storage Intelligent Edge Financial Services Corporate Investments and Other Total   In millions Balance at October 31, 2022 (1) $ 7,692   $ 2,889   $ 4,000   $ 2,555   $ 144   $ 123   $ 17,403   Goodwill acquired during the period —   18   —   —   —   —   18   Balance at January 31, 2023 $ 7,692   $ 2,907   $ 4,000   $ 2,555   $ 144   $ 123   $ 17,421   (1)     As a result of the organizational realignments which were effective as of November 1, 2022, (described in Note 1, "Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"), $ 160  million of goodwill was reallocated from the Storage segment to the Compute segment as of the beginning of the period using a relative fair value approach. The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of its fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment.
As of the annual test date in fiscal 2022, the HPC & AI reporting unit had goodwill of $ 2.9  billion and an excess of fair value over carrying value of net assets of
0 %. The HPC & AI reporting unit relies significantly on the income approach which estimates the fair value based on the present value of future cash flows. The HPC & AI business is facing challenges primarily related to supply chain constraints and other operational challenges impacting the Company’s ability to achieve certain customer acceptance milestones required for revenue recognition and resulting cost increases associated with fulfilling contracts over longer than originally anticipated timelines. The Company currently believes these challenges will be successfully addressed as the supply chain constraints are improving. If the global macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions worsen, projected revenue growth rates or operating margins decline, weighted average cost of capital increases, or if the Company has significant or sustained decline in its stock price, it is possible its estimates about the HPC & AI reporting unit's ability to
22 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) successfully address the current challenges may change, which could result in the carrying value of the HPC & AI reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value and potential impairment charges.
As of the annual test date in fiscal 2022, the Software reporting unit had goodwill of $ 123
million and an excess of fair value over carrying value of net assets of
0 %. The Software reporting unit relies significantly on the market approach, which is impacted by market volatility. If global macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions worsen and cause a further decline in the equity market or if revenue expectations are not met, this could result in the carrying value of the Software reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value and potential impairment charges.
Note 9:
Fair Value Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are developed using market data such as publicly available information and reflect the assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using the best information available about the assumptions market participants would use. The following table presents the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:   As of January 31, 2023 As of October 31, 2022   Fair Value Measured Using Fair Value Measured Using   Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Remaining Inputs

billion and $ 12.2
billion, respectively. As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, the carrying value of the Company's short-term and long-term debt was $ 12.9
billion and $ 12.5
billion, respectively. If measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, short-term and long-term debt would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value: Equity investments are recorded at cost and measured at fair value when they are deemed to be impaired or when there is an adjustment from observable price changes. For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment of $ 10  million on these investments. The Company did not recognize any impairments on these equity investments during the three months ended January 31, 2022. If measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, these would generally be classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value due to their short-term nature. Non-Financial Assets: The Company's non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, goodwill, and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost. The Company records right-of-use assets based on the lease liability, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received, and the lessee's initial direct costs. Fair value adjustments are made to these non-financial assets in the period an impairment charge is recognized. 24 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 10:

Note 14:
Litigation, Contingencies, and Commitments Litigation Hewlett Packard Enterprise is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property, commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits, and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, as part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement (the "Separation and Distribution Agreement") entered into in connection with Hewlett Packard Enterprise's spin-off from HP Inc. (formerly known as "Hewlett-Packard Company") (the "Separation"), Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. agreed to cooperate with each other in managing certain existing litigation related to both parties' businesses. The Separation and Distribution Agreement included provisions that allocate liability and financial responsibility for pending litigation involving the parties, as well as provide for cross-indemnification of the parties against liabilities to one party arising out of liabilities allocated to the other party. The Separation and Distribution Agreement also included provisions that assign to the parties responsibility for managing pending and future litigation related to the general corporate matters of HP Inc. arising prior to the Separation. Hewlett Packard Enterprise records a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. Hewlett Packard Enterprise reviews these matters at least quarterly and adjusts these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular matter. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of January 31, 2023, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in its financial statements. 30 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) Litigation, Proceedings and Investigations Ross and Rogus v. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company.
On November 8, 2018, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara alleging that HPE pays its California-based female employees “systemically lower compensation” than HPE pays male employees performing substantially similar work. The complaint alleges various California state law claims, including California’s Equal Pay Act, Fair Employment and Housing Act, and Unfair Competition Law, and seeks certification of a California-only class of female employees employed in certain “Covered Positions.” The complaint seeks damages, statutory and civil penalties, attorneys’ fees and costs. On April 2, 2019, HPE filed a demurrer to all causes of action and an alternative motion to strike portions of the complaint. On July 2, 2019, the court denied HPE’s demurrer as to the claims of the putative class and granted HPE’s demurrer as to the claims of the individual plaintiffs. The parties have reached an agreement to resolve this litigation. The terms of the class settlement are reflected in Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement and Certification of Settlement Class, which was filed with the Court on September 26, 2022. On November 3, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion and preliminarily approved the terms of the class settlement, which defines the settlement class as all “[w]omen actively employed in California by Defendant at any point from November 1, 2015 through the date of Preliminary Approval” who were employed in a covered job code. The settlement class excludes certain individuals, including those who previously executed an arbitration agreement with HPE or an agreement that resulted in a release or waiver of claims. The hearing on final approval of the class settlement is scheduled for April 27, 2023.
India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Proceedings .
On April 30 and May 10, 2010, the India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (the "DRI") issued show cause notices to Hewlett-Packard India Sales Private Ltd ("HP India"), a subsidiary of HP Inc.,
seven
HP India employees and
one
former HP India employee alleging that HP India underpaid customs duties while importing products and spare parts into India and seeking to recover an aggregate of approximately $ 370
million, plus penalties. Prior to the issuance of the show cause notices, HP India deposited approximately $ 16
million with the DRI and agreed to post a provisional bond in exchange for the DRI's agreement to not seize HP India products and spare parts and to not interrupt the transaction of business by HP India. On April 11, 2012, the Bangalore Commissioner of Customs issued an order on the products-related show cause notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HP India and the named individuals of approximately $ 386
million, of which HP India had already deposited $ 9
million. On December 11, 2012, HP India voluntarily deposited an additional $ 10
million in connection with the products-related show cause notice. On April 20, 2012, the Commissioner issued an order on the parts-related show cause notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HP India and certain of the named individuals of approximately $ 17
million, of which HP India had already deposited $ 7
million. After the order, HP India deposited an additional $ 3
million in connection with the parts-related show cause notice to avoid certain penalties. HP India filed appeals of the Commissioner's orders before the Customs Tribunal along with applications for waiver of the pre-deposit of remaining demand amounts as a condition for hearing the appeals. The Customs Department has also filed cross-appeals before the Customs Tribunal. On January 24, 2013, the Customs Tribunal ordered HP India to deposit an additional $ 24
million against the products order, which HP India deposited in March 2013. The Customs Tribunal did not order any additional deposit to be made under the parts order. In December 2013, HP India filed applications before the Customs Tribunal seeking early hearing of the appeals as well as an extension of the stay of deposit as to HP India and the individuals already granted until final disposition of the appeals. On February 7, 2014, the application for extension of the stay of deposit was granted by the Customs Tribunal until disposal of the appeals. On October 27, 2014, the Customs Tribunal commenced hearings on the cross-appeals of the Commissioner's orders. The Customs Tribunal rejected HP India's request to remand the matter to the Commissioner on procedural grounds. The hearings were scheduled to reconvene on April 6, 2015, and again on November 3, 2015, April 11, 2016, and January 15, 2019, but were canceled at the request of the Customs Tribunal. The hearing was again rescheduled for January 20, 2021 but was postponed and has not yet been rescheduled. ECT Proceedings .
In January 2011, the postal service of Brazil, Empresa Brasileira de Correios e Telégrafos (“ECT”), notified a former subsidiary of HP Inc. in Brazil ("HP Brazil") that it had initiated administrative proceedings to consider whether to suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and contract with ECT related to alleged improprieties in the bidding and contracting processes whereby employees of HP Brazil and employees of several other companies allegedly coordinated their bids and fixed results for
three
ECT contracts in 2007 and 2008. In late July 2011, ECT notified HP Brazil it had decided to apply the penalties against HP Brazil and suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and contract with ECT for
five years , based upon the evidence before it. In August 2011, HP Brazil appealed ECT's decision. In April 2013, ECT rejected HP Brazil's appeal, and the administrative proceedings were closed with the penalties against HP Brazil remaining in place. In parallel, in September 2011,
31 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) HP Brazil filed a civil action against ECT seeking to have ECT's decision revoked. HP Brazil also requested an injunction suspending the application of the penalties until a final ruling on the merits of the case. The court of first instance has not issued a decision on the merits of the case, but it has denied HP Brazil's request for injunctive relief. HP Brazil appealed the denial of its request for injunctive relief to the intermediate appellate court, which issued a preliminary ruling denying the request for injunctive relief but reducing the length of the sanctions from
five
to
two years . HP Brazil appealed that decision and, in December 2011, obtained a ruling staying enforcement of ECT's sanctions until a final ruling on the merits of the case. HP Brazil expects any appeal of the decision on the merits to last several years. Forsyth, et al. vs. HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
This purported class and collective action was filed on August 18, 2016 and an amended complaint was filed on December 19, 2016 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, against HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging Defendants violated the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, California public policy and the California Business and Professions Code by terminating older workers and replacing them with younger workers. Plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide collective action under the ADEA comprised of all individuals age
40
years and older who had their employment terminated by an HP entity pursuant to a work force reduction (“WFR”) plan on or after December 9, 2014 for individuals terminated in deferral states and on or after April 8, 2015 in non-deferral states. Plaintiffs also seek to certify a Rule 23 class under California law comprised of all persons
40
years or older employed by Defendants in the state of California and terminated pursuant to a WFR plan on or after August 18, 2012. Following the filing of Plaintiffs' Fourth Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Class Certification on December 30, 2020. On April 14, 2021, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Conditional Class Certification was granted. The conditionally certified collective action consists of all individuals who had their employment terminated by Defendants pursuant to a WFR Plan on or after November 1, 2015, and who were
40
years or older at the time of such termination. The collective action excludes all individuals who signed a Waiver and General Release Agreement or an Agreement to Arbitrate Claims. The Court-approved notice was issued to potential class members and the opt-in period is now closed. Oracle America, Inc., et al. v. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (Terix copyright matter).
On March 22, 2016, Oracle filed a complaint against HPE in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging copyright infringement, interference with contract, intentional interference with prospective economic relations, and unfair competition. Oracle’s claims arise out of HPE’s prior use of a third-party maintenance provider named Terix Computer Company, Inc. (“Terix”). Oracle contends that in connection with HPE’s use of Terix as a subcontractor for certain customers of HPE’s multivendor support business, Oracle’s copyrights were infringed, and HPE is liable for vicarious and contributory infringement and related claims. The lawsuit against HPE follows a prior lawsuit brought by Oracle against Terix in 2013 relating to Terix’s alleged unauthorized provision of Solaris patches to customers on Oracle hardware. On January 29, 2019, the court granted HPE’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to all of Oracle’s claims. On February 20, 2019, the court entered judgment in favor of HPE, dismissing Oracle’s claims in their entirety. Oracle appealed the trial court’s ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On August 20, 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its ruling, affirming in part and reversing in part the trial court’s decision granting summary judgment in favor of HPE.
On October 6, 2020, the matter was remanded to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. On June 4, 2021, the Court issued an order denying HPE’s motion for summary judgment and granting-in-part Oracle’s motion for partial summary judgment as to a certain of HPE’s defenses. Trial began on May 23, 2022.
On June 15, 2022, the jury returned its verdict, awarding $ 30  million in compensatory damages to Oracle and rejecting Oracle’s request for punitive damages.
Judgment has not yet been entered by the Court as the parties are engaged in post-verdict motion practice on multiple issues, including HPE’s Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law and Oracle’s request for an award of prejudgment interest and attorneys’ fees. The parties have since reached an agreement to resolve this dispute. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, the case has been dismissed, and the matter is closed. Q3 Networking Litigation.
On September 21 and September 22, 2020, Q3 Networking LLC filed complaints against HPE, Aruba Networks, Commscope and Netgear in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the United States International Trade Commission (“ITC”). Both complaints allege infringement of
four
patents, and the ITC complaint defines the “accused products” as “routers, access points, controllers, network management servers, other networking products, and hardware and software components thereof.” The ITC action was instituted on October 23, 2020. The District of Delaware action has been stayed pending resolution of the ITC action. The evidentiary hearing before the ITC has been completed. On December 7, 2021, the Administrative Law Judge issued his initial determination finding no violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act. On May 3, 2022, the ITC issued its Notice of Final Determination, affirming the initial determination and

On June 18, 2022, Q3 Networking filed a petition for review of the ITC ruling with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Shared Litigation with HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus As part of the Separation and Distribution Agreements between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise and DXC, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Seattle SpinCo, the parties to each agreement agreed to cooperate with each other in managing certain existing litigation related to both parties' businesses. The Separation and Distribution Agreements also included provisions that assign to the parties responsibility for managing pending and future litigation related to the general corporate matters of HP Inc. (in the case of the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise from HP Inc.) or of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (in the case of the separation of DXC from Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the separation of Seattle SpinCo from Hewlett Packard Enterprise), in each case arising prior to the applicable separation. Environmental The Company's operations and products are or may in the future become subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; the management, movement, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; the clean-up of contaminated sites; product safety and compliance; the energy consumption of products, services, and operations; and the operational or financial responsibility for recycling, treatment, and disposal of those products. This includes legislation that makes producers of electrical goods, including servers and networking equipment, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as "product take-back legislation"). The Company could incur substantial costs, its products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions, and it could face other sanctions, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, including those related to addressing climate change and other environmental related issues, or if its products become non-compliant with such environmental laws. The Company's potential exposure includes impacts on revenue, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims and clean-up costs. The amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict. In particular, the Company may become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), known as "Superfund," or other federal, state or foreign laws and regulations addressing the clean-up of contaminated sites, and may become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by private parties for contribution towards clean-up costs. The Company is also contractually obligated to make financial contributions to address actions related to certain environmental liabilities, both ongoing and arising in the future, pursuant to its Separation and Distribution Agreement with HP Inc. Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, the Company may issue performance guarantees to certain of its clients, customers, and other parties pursuant to which the Company has guaranteed the performance obligations of third parties. Some of those guarantees may be backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, the Company would be obligated to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event a specified triggering event occurs as defined by the guarantee. The Company believes the likelihood of having to perform under a material guarantee is remote. The Company has entered into service contracts with certain of its clients that are supported by financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of the Company's non-performance under the contract or failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, the Company could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract. The Company believes the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets under these arrangements is remote. 33 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which the Company may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of the Company or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. The Company also provides indemnifications to certain vendors and customers against claims of IP infringement made by third parties arising from the use by such vendors and customers of the Company's software products and support services and certain other matters. Some indemnifications may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial. Note 15:

Axis Security is a cloud security provider, which will allow the Company to expand its edge-to-cloud security capabilities by offering a Security Access Services Edge solution. The total expected cash purchase price of the acquisitions is approximately $ 490
million, subject to normal working capital and other closing adjustments. The Company expects both transactions to close during fiscal 2023. 34 Table of Contents Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES For purposes of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") section, we use the terms "Hewlett Packard Enterprise", "HPE", the "Company", "we", "us" and "our" to refer to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. References in the MD&A section to "former Parent" refer to HP Inc.
We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist the reader in understanding our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, changes in certain key items in these financial statements from period-to-period and the primary factors that accounted for these changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies, and estimates affect our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. The financial discussion and analysis in the following MD&A compares the three months ended January 31, 2023 to the comparable prior-year period and where appropriate, as of January 31, 2023, unless otherwise noted.
This MD&A is organized as follows: • Trends and Uncertainties . A discussion of material events and uncertainties known to management, such as the ongoing macroeconomic environment of supply chain constraints, uneven customer demand, and inflationary pressures, and recently enacted tax legislation. • Executive Overview.  A discussion of our business and a summary analysis of our financial performance and other highlights, including non-GAAP financial measures, affecting the Company to provide context to the remainder of the MD&A.
• Results of Operations.
A discussion of the results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a discussion of the results of operations at the segment level. • Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.  A discussion of accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. • Liquidity and Capital Resources.  An analysis of changes in our cash flows, financial condition, liquidity, and cash requirements and commitments.
• GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations . Each non-GAAP financial measure has been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure therein. This section also includes a discussion of the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, and material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. 35 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES The demand environment has slowed during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 with uneven growth across various sectors. At the same time, mild improvements to industry-wide supply constraints have helped to ease certain of the supply chain challenges we encountered in the recent past, including facilitating an initial reduction to the high backlog levels we experienced in fiscal 2022. Nevertheless, we expect supply chain and inflationary pressures to continue to impact our overall costs. Additionally, we expect these pressures, along with possibly uneven demand, to moderate our revenue growth and delay certain unit shipments, resulting in part in an elevated level of order backlog and related inventory at the end of the current period. To address supply chain challenges, we are taking proactive measures, such as guiding certain customer demand to specific products, enhancing component engineering design, and multi-sourcing with indirect procurement. As previously mentioned, although certain of the supply chain pressures are beginning to ease, we expect the supply chain environment to continue to present challenges in the near term. Additionally, we are experiencing a challenging foreign exchange environment, which has moderated our revenue and earnings growth. We expect the unfavorable foreign exchange effects and inflationary trend to continue in the longer term. We expect the substantial completion of our HPE Next and cost optimization and prioritization restructuring plans, coupled with related cost reduction measures and operational efficiencies, may moderate the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange effects and inflationary pressures in fiscal 2023. Recent U.S. Tax Legislation On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the "Inflation Reduction Act") into law. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (the "Corporate AMT") of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income ("AFSI) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year period. The Corporate AMT is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2024. We are evaluating the Corporate AMT and its potential impact on our future U.S. tax expense, cash taxes, and effective tax rate. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act imposes an excise tax of 1% tax on the fair market value of net stock repurchases made after December 31, 202 2. The impact of this provision will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods.
Other than the previous discussion of the ongoing macroeconomic environment of supply chain constraint s, inflationary pressures, and recently enacted tax legislation, man agement believes that there have been no significant changes to the discussion of "Trends and Uncertainties" in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.

36 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Financial Results The following table summarizes our condensed consolidated GAAP financial results: For the three months ended January 31, 2023 2022 Change Dollars in millions, except per share amounts Net revenue $ 7,809  $ 6,961  12.2% Gross profit $ 2,658  $ 2,344  13.4% Gross profit margin 34.0  % 33.7  % 0.3pts Earnings from operations $ 591  $ 448  31.9% Operating profit margin 7.6  % 6.4  % 1.2pts Net earnings $ 501  $ 513  (2.3)% Diluted net earnings per share $ 0.38  $ 0.39  $(0.01) Cash flow used in operations $ (829) $ (76) $(753) N et revenue of $7.8 billion represented an increase of 12.2% (increased 17.7% on a constant currency basis) due to a high order backlog and an improving supply chain environment. The net revenue increase was moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations. The net revenue increase resulted primarily from effective pricing management in server products, supply and operational improvements in HPE Cray Supercomputing, and strong demand for our networking products. The gross profit margin of 34.0% (or $2.7 billion) represents an increase of 0.3 percentage points from the prior-year period as the combination of pricing discipline in server and storage products and a mix shift to higher margin software rich offerings was offset by lower support services revenue. The operating profit margin of 7.6% represents an increase of 1.2 percentage points due primarily to strong expense management moderated by higher variable compensation expense including planned investments in research and development. The following table summarizes our condensed consolidated non-GAAP financial results: For the three months ended January 31, 2023 2022 Change Dollars in millions, except per share amounts Net revenue adjusted for currency
$ 8,193  $ 6,961  17.7% Non-GAAP gross profit $ 2,674  $ 2,360  13.3% Non-GAAP gross profit margin 34.2  % 33.9  % 0.3pts Non-GAAP earnings from operations $ 918  $ 768  19.5% Non-GAAP operating profit margin 11.8  % 11.0  % 0.8pts Non-GAAP net earnings $ 828  $ 697  18.8% Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share $ 0.63  $ 0.53  $0.10 Free cash flow $ (1,326) $ (577) $(749) 37 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Each non-GAAP financial measure has been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure herein. Please refer to the section "GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations" included in this MD&A for these reconciliations, a discussion of the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures and material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Annualized Revenue Run-rate ("ARR") ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income from finance leases), and software-as-a-service, software consumption revenue, and other as-a-service offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We believe that ARR is a metric that allows management to better understand and highlight the potential future performance of our as-a-service business. We also believe ARR provides investors with greater transparency to our financial information and of the performance metric used in our financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes of management.” We use ARR as a performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it.
ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers. The following presents our ARR as of January 31, 2023 and 2022: For the three months ended January 31, 2023 2022 Dollars in millions ARR $ 1,006  $ 798 Year-over-year growth rate 26% 23% T he 26% increase in ARR was due primarily to growth in our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform and related financial services moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations. The growth in the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform was due to an expanding customer installed base. At the segment level, the growth was led by Intelligent Edge as-a-service activity and Storage as-a-service including Zerto.
Dividends Returning capital to our shareholders remains an important part of our capital allocation framework, which also consists of strategic investments. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share to our shareholders. On March 2, 2023, we declared a regular cash dividend of $0.12 per share on our common stock, payable on April 14, 2023, to our shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 17, 2023. As of January 31, 2023, we had a remaining authorization of $1.3 billion for future share repurchases.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our overall net revenue. As a result, our revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis, which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prior-year period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This change in revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated as the quotient of (a) current year revenue converted to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates divided by (b) the prior-year period revenue. This information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. This constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a GAAP basis. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes. 38 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows:   For the three months ended January 31,   2023 2022   Dollars % of Revenue Dollars % of Revenue   Dollars in millions Net revenue $ 7,809  100.0  % $ 6,961  100.0  % Cost of sales 5,151  66.0  4,617  66.3  Gross profit 2,658  34.0  2,344  33.7  Research and development 623  8.0  504  7.2  Selling, general and administrative 1,257  16.1  1,201  17.3  Amortization of intangible assets 73  0.9  73  1.1  Transformation costs 102  1.3  111  1.6  Disaster charges (recovery) 1  —  (1) —  Acquisition, disposition and other related charges 11  0.1  8  0.1  Earnings from operations

U.S. net revenue increased by $567 million, or 24.5% to $2.9 billion, and net revenue from outside of the U.S. increased by $281 million, or 6.1%, to $4.9 billion.
From a segment perspective, net revenu e increased across most of our segments due to the improved demand environment led by revenue growth of 34%, 25%, 14%, 5% and 4% in HPC & AI, Intelligent Edge, Compute, Storage and Financial Services, respectively, and decreased 10% in Corporate Investments and Other. The components of the weighted net revenue change by segment were as follows: For the three months ended January 31, 2023 Percentage points Compute 5.9  HPC & AI 3.8  Storage 0.8  Intelligent Edge 3.2  Financial Services 0.4  Corporate Investments (0.3) Total Segment 13.8  Elimination of Intersegment net revenue and Other (1.6) Total HPE 12.2  39 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Please refer to the section "Segment Information" further below for a discussion of our results of operations for each reportable segment. Gross profit Gross profit margin of 34.0%, represents an increase of 0.3 percentage points as the combination of pricing discipline and strong cost management in server and storage products and a mix shift to higher margin software rich offerings was offset by lower support services revenue and higher variable compensation expense. Operating expenses Research and development ("R&D") R&D expense increased by $119 million, or 24% due primarily to higher employee cost driven by higher variable compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") SG&A expense increased by $56 million, or 5%
due primarily to higher software expenditures, increased employee cost driven by higher variable compensation expense and increased travel expense as the economy reopens and COVID-19 restrictions ease, all of which contributed 1.6 percentage points, 1.5 percentage points and 1.1 percentage points, respectively, to the change. Additionally, the overall increase in SG&A expense was moderated across various expense categories by favorable currency fluctuations.
Transformation programs and costs Our transformation programs consist of the cost optimization and prioritization plan (launched in 2020) and the HPE Next initiative (launched in 2017). Transformation costs
decreased by $9 million, or 8% due to lower charges incurred in the current period as these plans approach completion through fiscal 2023. For
a further discussion, refer to Note 3, "Transformation Programs" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I. Interest and other, net
Interest and other, net expense
increased by $20 million due primarily to the impact of the prior period containing gains from equity investments and from the sale of certain assets, and increased interest expense in the current period. This increase was moderated by favorable currency fluctuations and increased interest income from higher interest rates in the current period. Tax indemnification and related adjustments We record changes to certain pre-separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which we remain liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification. We recorded Tax indemnification and related adjustments expense of $1 million and $17 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Non-service net periodic benefit credit Non-service net periodic benefit credit decreased by $36 million due primarily to increased interest cost resulting from higher discount rates, partially offset by higher expected returns on assets and lower amortized actuarial losses in the current periods.
Earnings from equity interests Earnings from equity interests primarily represents our 49% interest in H3C Technologies
Co. Limited ("H3C") and the amortization of our interest in basis difference. Earnings from equity interests increased by $27 million due primarily to the current period containing higher net income earned by H3C.
40 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) (Provision) benefit for taxes For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded income tax expense of $122 million and income tax benefit of $20 million, respectively, which reflects an effective tax rate of 19.6% and (4.1)%, respectively. Our effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world but are also impacted by discrete tax adjustments during each fiscal period. For further discussion, refer to Note 5, "Taxes on Earnings" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I. Segment Information Hewlett Packard Enterprise's organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), uses to evaluate, view, and run our business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management to evaluate segment results. As described in Note 1, "Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, HPE implemented an organizational change to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure resulting in changes to the previously reported segment net revenue and earnings from operations of the Compute and Storage segments. These changes had no impact to HPE’s previously reported consolidated GAAP results. A description of the products and services for each segment, along with other pertinent information related to our segments can be found in Note 2, "Segment Information" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I.
Segment Results The following table and ensuing discussion provide an overview of our key financial metrics by segment for the three months ended January 31, 2023, as compared to the prior-year period: HPE Consolidated Compute HPC & AI Storage Intelligent Edge Financial Services Corporate Investments Dollars in millions Net revenue (1) $ 7,809 $ 3,456 $ 1,056 $ 1,187 $ 1,127 $ 873 $ 293 Year-over-year change % 12.2  % 13.5  % 33.7  % 5.2  % 25.1  % 3.7  % (9.8) % Earnings (loss) from operations (2) $ 591  $ 609  $ 1  $ 142  $ 247  $ 82  $ (55) Earnings (loss) from operations as a % of net revenue 7.6  % 17.6  % 0.1  % 12.0  % 21.9  % 9.4  % (18.8) % Year-over-year change percentage points 1.2  pts 3.6  pts 1.0  pts (1.9) pts 4.5  pts (3.0) pts (15.4) pts (1) HPE consolidated net revenue excludes intersegment net revenue. (2) Segment earnings from operations exclude certain unallocated corporate costs and eliminations, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of initial direct costs, amortization of intangible assets, transformation costs, acquisition, disposition and other related charges, and disaster charges (recovery). C ompute   For the three months ended January 31,   2023 2022 % Change   Dollars in millions   Net revenue $ 3,456  $ 3,044  13.5  % Earnings from operations $ 609  $ 427  42.6  % Earnings from operations as a % of net revenue 17.6  % 14.0  %   41 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Compute net revenue increased by $412 million , or 13.5% (increased 19.4% on a constant currency basis) driven by a
high order backlog and improvements in the supply chain environment. Leading the increase was higher average unit prices resulting from a combination of increased sales of server configurations with more complex component architectures and disciplined pricing actions. Moderating this increase was unfavorable currency fluctuations and lower unit shipments. Product revenue growth was driven by the rack server category. Services net revenue declined primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Compute earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 3.6 percentage points due to decreases in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expense as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to pricing discipline and strong cost management partially offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations and higher variable compensation. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased primarily due to our optimized expense structure partially offset by higher variable compensation expense.
HPC & AI   For the three months ended January 31,   2023 2022 % Change Dollars in millions   Net revenue $ 1,056  $ 790  33.7  % Earnings (loss) from operations $ 1  $ (7) (114.3) % Earnings (loss) from operations as a % of net revenue 0.1  % (0.9) % HPC & AI net revenue increased by $266 million, or 33.7% (increased 37.2% on a constant currency basis) driven by a high order backlog and improvements in the supply environment. Leading the increase was growth in HPC led by the HPE Cray Supercomputing product portfolio, as operational and supply improvements addressed recent challenges with achieving certain customer acceptance milestones for revenue recognition. We also experienced revenue growth in the Data Solutions product category. These increases were moderated by an uneven demand environment in HPE Apollo products, and lower services revenue due primarily to an unfavorable portfolio mix of service offerings and unfavorable currency fluctuations. HPC & AI earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 1.0 percentage points due to a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue, partially offset by an increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to lower revenue from higher-margin services and higher variable compensation expense. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to our optimized expense structure moderated by higher variable compensation expense.
Storage   For the three months ended January 31,   2023 2022 % Change   Dollars in millions   Net revenue $ 1,187  $ 1,128  5.2  % Earnings from operations $ 142  $ 157  (9.6) % Earnings from operations as a % of net revenue 12.0  % 13.9  % Storage net revenue increased by $59 million or 5.2% (increased 10.5% on a constant currency bas is) as improvements in the supply environment were partially offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations. Net revenue increased in Storage products moderated by a net revenue decrease in Storage services. The increase in Storage products was led by higher revenue from HPE Alletra, Hyperconverged and HPE Primera products, partially offset by lower HPE 3PAR revenue, as we transition to next generation product platforms, such as HPE Alletra. The decrease in Storage services was due to lower support services revenue as certain hardware products approach their end-of-life and product transitions. 42 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Storage earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 1.9 percentage points due to increases in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to lower revenue from support services as we continue our transition to more software-rich products, unfavorable currency fluctuations, and higher variable compensation expense. These impacts were partially offset by lower supply chain costs to expedite product delivery and disciplined pricing actions.
The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primar ily to higher variable compensation expense. Intelligent Edge   For the three months ended January 31,   2023 2022 % Change   Dollars in millions   Net revenue $ 1,127  $ 901  25.1  % Earnings from operations $ 247  $ 157  57.3  % Earnings from operations as a % of net revenue 21.9  % 17.4  %   Intelligent Edge net revenue increased by $226 million, or 25.1% (increased 31.0% on a constant currency basis) primarily
due to strong demand, which was reflected in a high backlog, improved supply chain execution, and disciplined pricing actions. As a result, net revenue increased in both products and services, moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations. The increase in product revenue was primarily driven by the wireless local area network ("WLAN") and switching businesses, which benefited from improvements in the supply environment while services revenue growth was led by our as-a-service offerings. Intelligent Edge earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 4.5 percentage points due primarily to decreases in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. T he decrease in cost of product and services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to disciplined cost management and pricing actions, moderated by a lower mix of support services revenue and higher variable compensation expense. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased primarily due to our cost containment measures partially offset by higher variable compensation expense.

FS net revenue increased by $31 million, or 3.7% (increased 8.1% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to high er rental revenue from higher average operating leases an d higher asset management revenue from lease buyouts, partially offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations.
FS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 3.0 percentage points due to an increase in cost of services as a percentage of net revenue, while operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue were relatively flat. The increase to cost of services as a percentage of net revenue resulted primarily from a combination of higher borrowing costs and higher depreciation expense.

Portfolio Assets and Ratios The portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheets for FS were as follows:   As of   January 31, 2023 October 31, 2022   Dollars in millions Financing receivables, gross $ 8,859  $ 8,359  Net equipment under operating leases 4,267  4,103  Capitalized profit on intercompany equipment transactions (1) 259  241  Intercompany leases (1) 97  97  Gross portfolio assets 13,482  12,800  Allowance for credit losses (2) 238  222  Operating lease equipment reserve 48  44  Total reserves 286  266  Net portfolio assets $ 13,196  $ 12,534  Reserve coverage 2.1  % 2.1  % Debt-to-equity ratio (3) 7.0x 7.0x
(1) Intercompany activity is eliminated in consolidation. (2) Allowance for credit losses for financing receivables includes both the short- and long-term portions. (3) Debt benefiting FS consists of intercompany equity that is treated as debt for segment reporting purposes, intercompany debt, and borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries. Debt benefiting FS totaled $12.1 billion and $11.5 billion at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively, and was determined by applying an assumed debt-to-equity ratio, which management believes to be comparable to that of other similar financing companies. FS equity at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 was $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, FS net cash and cash equivalents balances were approximately $1.0 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. Net portfolio assets as of January 31, 2023 increased 5.3% from October 31, 2022. The increase generally resulted from favorable currency fluctuations, along with new financing volume exceeding portfolio runoff during the period. FS bad debt expense includes charges to general reserves, specific reserves, and write-offs for sales-type, direct-financing, and operating leases. For the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, FS recorded net bad debt expense of $19 million and $23 million, respectively.
As of January 31, 2023, FS experienced an increase in billed finance receivables compared to October 31, 2022, which included a limited impact to collections from customers in Russia. We are currently unable to fully predict the extent to which our exit from Russia and Belarus businesses may adversely impact future collections of our receivables. 44 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Corporate Investments and Other   For the three months ended January 31,   2023 2022 % Change   Dollars in millions Net revenue $ 293  $ 325  (9.8) % Loss from operations $ (55) $ (11) (400.0) % Loss from operations as a % of net revenue (18.8) % (3.4) % Corporate Investments and Other net revenue decreased by $32 million, or 9.8% (decreased 1.5% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Corporate Investments and Other loss from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 15.4 percentage points due primarily to increases in cost of services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to
the scale of the net revenue decline driven by unfavorable currency fluctuations and higher services delivery costs due to higher variable compensation expense. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to higher variable compensation expense. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), which requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to a material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain, and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Accounting policies that are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgements include revenue recognition, taxes on earnings, business combinations, impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets, and contingencies. As of January 31, 2023, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Current Overview We use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that internally generated cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, product development initiatives, acquisitions, and disposal activities including legal settlements, restructuring activities, transformation costs, indemnifications, maturing debt, interest payments, and income tax payments, in addition to any future investments, share repurchases, and shareholder dividend payments. We expect to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, by accessing the capital markets, issuing commercial paper, and borrowing under credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. However, our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market, and economic conditions. We anticipate that the funds made available and cash generated from operations, along with our access to capital markets, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter.
Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of Part II and market risks identified in the section entitled "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in Item 3 of Part I. Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with a substantial amount held outside the U.S. as of January 31, 2023. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. 45 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Amounts held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support our non-U.S. liquidity needs. Repatriations of amounts held outside the U.S. generally will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is to keep cash balances outside of the U.S. and to meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. We do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations. In connection with the share repurchase program previously authorized by our Board of Directors, during the first three months of fiscal 2023, we repurchased and settled an aggregate amount of $73 million. As of January 31, 2023, we had a remaining authorization of $1.3 billion for future share repurchases. For more information on our share repurchase program, refer to the section entitled "Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds" in Item 2 of Part II.     Pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement among us, Unisplendor International Technology Limited ("UNIS"), and H3C dated as of May 1, 2016, as amended from time to time, and most recently on October 28, 2022, we delivered a notice to UNIS on December 30, 2022, to exercise our right to put to UNIS, for cash consideration, all of the H3C shares held by us, which represent 49% of the total issued share capital of H3C, at a price per share of 15.0 times the last twelve months’ post-tax profit of H3C (measured as of the period ending April 30, 2022) divided by the total number of H3C shares outstanding as of December 30, 2022. The determination of the purchase price remains subject to agreement among the parties, taking into account certain adjustments to the post-tax profit of H3C pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders’ Agreement and the availability of the necessary information to make such determination. Following a determination of the purchase price and the timing of the receipt of proceeds, we intend to consider a range of allocation activities, in line with our practice of pursuing a balanced, returns-based approach for capital allocation decisions, including but not limited to organic and strategic investments, return of capital to shareholders, repayment and/or redemption of outstanding debt, and general corporate purposes. The disposition is also subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals. Liquidity Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, total debt, and available borrowing resources were as follows: As of
January 31, 2023 October 31, 2022 In millions Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 2,844  $ 4,763  Total debt 12,926  12,465  Available borrowing resources 5,260  6,161  Commercial paper programs (1) 4,311  5,208  Uncommitted lines of credit $ 949  $ 953  (1)    The maximum aggregate borrowing amount of the commercial paper programs and revolving credit facility is $5.75 billion.

The increase was primarily due to unfavorable working capital resulting from higher vendor payments, an increase in financing receivables, moderated by unfavorable hedging positions and the prior-year period containing higher cash payouts for va riable compensation. Our working capital metrics and cash conversion impacts were as follows:   As of As of   January 31, 2023 October 31, 2022 Change January 31, 2022 October 31, 2021 Change Y/Y Change Days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("DSO") 48  47  1  44  49  (5) 4  Days of supply in inventory ("DOS") 81  88  (7) 104  82  22  (23) Days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable ("DPO") (114) (149) 35  (128) (128) —  14  Cash conversion cycle 15  (14) 29  20  3  17  (5) The cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO. Items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in payment terms (including extended payment terms to customers or from suppliers), early or late invoice payments from customers or to suppliers, the extent of receivables factoring, seasonal trends, the timing of the revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period, the impact of commodity costs, and acquisition activity.
DSO measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. Compared to the corresponding three-month period in fiscal 2022, the increase in DSO in the current period was primarily due to unfavorable billings linearity and extended payment terms. DOS measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our products. DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. Compared to the corresponding three-month period in fiscal 2022, the decrease in DOS in the current period was primarily due to lower levels of inventory resulting from a reduction in our backlog positions, and lower replenishment of materials.
DPO measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. Compared to the corresponding three-month period in fiscal 2022, the decrease in DPO in the current period was primarily due to higher vendor payments from prior period purchases and lower inventory purchases during the current period. Investing Activities For the three months ended January 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities increased by $0.9 billion, as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher cash utilized in net financial collateral activities of $0.8 billion and higher cash utilized for investment in property, plant and equipment, net of sales proceeds of $0.1 billion, as compared to the prior-year period. Financing Activities For the three months ended January 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $0.3 billion, as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022. This was primarily due to lower proceeds from debt, net of issuance cost moderated by higher cash from short term borrowings, as compared to the prior-year period.

For the three months ended January 31, 2023, free cash flow decreased by $0.7 billion, as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2022. The decrease was due to lower cash generated from operations due to unfavorable working capital resulting from higher vendor payments, higher cash utilized for investments in PP&E, net of sales proceeds, moderated by a favorable currency impact on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, as compared to the prior-year period.
For more information on the impact of operating assets and liabilities to our cash flows, see Note 6, "Balance Sheet Details" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I. Capital Resources We maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of several factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital, and targeted capital structure. We maintain a revolving credit facility and two commercial paper programs, "the Parent Programs", and a wholly-owned subsidiary maintains a third program. There have been no changes to our commercial paper programs, revolving credit facility and shelf registration statement since October 31, 2022. For further information on our capital resources, see Note 11, "Borrowings" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I. As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under our $4.75 billion revolving credit facility. As of January 31, 2023, $759 million was outstanding under the Parent Programs. As of October 31, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under the Parent Programs. As of January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, $680 million and $542 million, respectively, were outstanding under our subsidiary’s program. During the first three months of fiscal 2023, we issued $1.9 billion and repaid $1.1 billion of commercial paper. Cash Requirements and Commitments
Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations have not changed materially outside of the normal course of business since October 31, 2022. For further information see "Cash Requirements and Commitments" in Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.
Retirement Benefit Plan Funding For the remainder of fiscal 2023, we anticipate making contributions of approximately $122 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. Our policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by various authorities including local government and tax authorities. 48 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Restructuring Plans As of January 31, 2023, we expect to make future cash payments of approximately $420 million in connection with our approved restructuring plans, which includes $280 million expected to be paid through the remainder of fiscal 2023 and $140 million expected to be paid thereafter. For more information on our restructuring activities, see Note 3, "Transformation Programs" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I. Uncertain Tax Positions
As of January 31, 2023, we had approximately $320 million of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions. These liabilities and related interest and penalties include $36 million expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining amount, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. Payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. For more information on our uncertain tax positions, see Note 5, "Taxes on Earnings" to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We have third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. For more information on our third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements, see Note 6, "Balance Sheet Details", to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I.

These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management for purposes of evaluating our historical and prospective financial performance, as well as evaluating our performance relative to our competitors. These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a constant currency basis is net revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP earnings from operations is earnings from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue) is operating profit margin (earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow is cash flow from operations. Net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change in the foreign exchange rate from the prior-year period. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin are defined to exclude charges related to the amortization of initial direct costs, and stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP earnings from operations and non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue) consist of earnings from operations excluding any charges related to the amortization of initial direct costs, amortization of intangible assets, transformation costs, stock-based compensation expense, disaster charges (recovery), and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges, as well as items such as tax indemnification and related adjustments, non-service net periodic benefit credit, earnings from equity interests, and adjustments for taxes. The Adjustments for taxes line item includes certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of tax reform, structural rate adjustment, excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation, and adjustments for additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item. We believe that excluding the items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of our segments. Management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results, and excluding them facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance in comparison to our peers. The excluded items can be inconsistent in amount and frequency and/or not reflective of the operational performance of the business.
These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are that they can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures and cash flows, they may be calculated differently by other companies and may not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of certain assets.
51 Table of Content HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We compensate for these limitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. We also provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure. We believe that providing net revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP earnings from operations, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and free cash flow, in addition to the related GAAP measures provides greater transparency to the information used in our financial and operational decision making and allows the reader of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to see our financial results “through the eyes” of management. 52 Table of Contents Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting HPE, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.

The following disclosure is being made under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act: On March 2, 2021, the U.S. Secretary of State designated the Russian Federal Security Service (“FSB”) as a party subject to the provisions of U.S. Executive Order No. 13382 issued in 2005 (“Executive Order 13382”). On the same day, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) updated General License 1B (“General License 1B”) which generally authorizes U.S. companies to engage in certain licensing, permitting, certification, notification, and related transactions with the FSB as may be required for the importation, distribution, or use of information technology products in the Russian Federation. Our local subsidiary may be required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and to file documents. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by HPE with the FSB and all such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B. We plan to continue these activities as required to support our orderly and managed wind down of our Russia operations. For a summary of our revenue recognition policies, see "Revenue Recognition" described in Note 1, "Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.
