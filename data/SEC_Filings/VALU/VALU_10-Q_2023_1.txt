Note
1
- Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
Value Line, Inc. ("Value Line" or "VLI", and collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) is incorporated in the State of New York.  The name "Value Line" as used to describe the Company, its products, and its subsidiaries, is a registered trademark of the Company.  The Company's core business is producing investment periodicals and their underlying research and making available certain Value Line copyrights, Value Line trademarks and Value Line Proprietary Ranks and other proprietary information, to
third
parties under written agreements for use in
third -party managed and marketed investment products and for other purposes.  The Company maintains a significant investment in Eulav Asset Management LLC ("EAM")  from which it receives a non-voting revenues interest  and a non-voting profits interest.  Pursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust dated as of
December 23, 2010 ( the "EAM Trust Agreement"), VLI granted EAM the right to use the Value Line name for all existing Value Line Funds and agreed to supply, without charge or expense, the Value Line Proprietary Ranking System information to EAM for use in managing the Value Line Funds.  EAM was established to provide investment management services to the Value Line Mutual Funds ("Value Line Funds" or the "Funds").
The Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets as of
January 31, 2023
and
April 30, 2022,
which have been derived from the unaudited interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively,  were prepared following the interim reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  In the opinion of management, the accompanying Unaudited Interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals except as noted below) considered necessary for a fair presentation.  This report should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and footnotes contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10 -K for the fiscal year ended
April 30, 2022
filed with the SEC on
July 26, 2022 ( the “Form
10 -K”). Results of operations covered by this report
may
not
be indicative of the results of operations for the entire year.
Use of Estimates:
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results
may
differ from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation:
The Company follows the guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Topic
810
“Consolidation” to determine if it should consolidate its investment in a variable interest entity ("VIE"). A VIE is a legal entity in which either (i) equity investors do
not
have sufficient equity investment at risk to enable the entity to finance its activities independently or (ii) the equity holders at risk lack the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns or the right to make decisions about the entity’s activities that most significantly affect the entity's economic performance.  A holder of a variable interest in a VIE is required to consolidate the entity if it is determined that it has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and is therefore the primary beneficiary.  The determination of a controlling financial interest in a VIE is based on a qualitative assessment to identify the variable interest holder, if any, that has (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (ii) either the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  The accounting guidance requires the Company to perform an ongoing assessment of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE and the Company has determined it is
not
the primary beneficiary of a VIE (see Note
3 ).
In accordance with FASB's Topic
810,
the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling interest have been consolidated.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The Company holds a significant non-voting revenues interest (excluding distribution revenues) and a significant non-voting profits interest in EULAV Asset Management, a Delaware statutory trust (“EAM” or “EAM Trust”).  The Company relied on the guidance in FASB's ASC Topics
323
and
810
in its determination
not
to consolidate its investment in EAM and to account for such investment under the equity method of accounting. The Company reports the amount it receives for its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests as a separate line item below operating income in the Consolidated Condensed  Statements of Income.
Revenue Recognition:
Depending upon the product, subscription fulfillment for Value Line periodicals and related publications is available in print or digitally, via internet access.  The length of a subscription varies by product and offer received by the subscriber.  Generally, subscriptions are offered as annual subscriptions.  Subscription revenues, net of discounts, are recognized ratably on a straight line basis when the product is served to the client over the life of the subscription.  Accordingly, the amount of subscription fees to be earned by fulfilling subscriptions after the date of the balance sheets are shown as unearned revenue within current and long-term liabilities.
Copyright fees are derived from providing certain Value Line trademarks and the Value Line Proprietary Ranks to
third
parties under written agreements for use in selecting securities for
third
party marketed products, including unit investment trusts, annuities and exchange traded funds ("ETFs").  The Company earns asset-based copyright fees upon delivery of the product to the customer as specified in the individual agreements.  Revenue is recognized monthly and received either quarterly or in advance over the term of the agreement and, because it is asset-based, will fluctuate as the market value of the underlying portfolio increases or decreases in value.

Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
January 31, 2023
(Unaudited)
Investment in Unconsolidated Entities:
The Company accounts for its investment in its unconsolidated entity, EAM, using the equity method of accounting in accordance with FASB’s ASC
323.   The equity method is an appropriate means of recognizing increases or decreases measured by GAAP in the economic resources underlying the investments.  Under the equity method, an investor recognizes its share of the earnings or losses of an investee in the periods for which they are reported by the investee in its financial statements rather than in the period in which an investee declares a dividend or distribution. An investor adjusts the carrying amount of an investment for its share of the earnings or losses recognized by the investee.
The Company’s “interests” in EAM, the investment adviser to and the sole member of the distributor of the Value Line Funds, consist of a "non-voting revenues interest" and a "non-voting profits interest" in EAM as defined in the EAM Trust Agreement.  The non-voting revenues interest entitles the Company to receive a range of
41 % to
55 % of EAM’s adjusted gross revenues, excluding EULAV Securities' distribution revenues (“Revenues Interest”).  The non-voting profits interest entitles the Company to receive
50 % of EAM's profits, subject to certain limited adjustments as defined in the EAM Trust Agreement (“Profits Interest”).  The Revenues Interest and at least
90 % of the Profits Interest are to be distributed each quarter to all interest holders of EAM, including Value Line.  The Company's Revenues Interest in EAM excludes participation in the service and distribution fees of EAM's subsidiary EULAV Securities.  The Company reflects its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM as non-operating income under the equity method of accounting.  Although the Company does
not
have control over the operating and financial policies of EAM, pursuant to the EAM Trust Agreement, the Company has a contractual right to receive its share of EAM's revenues and profits.
Valuation of Securities:
The Company's securities classified as cash equivalents, equity securities and available-for-sale fixed income securities consist of shares of money market funds that invest primarily in short-term U.S. Government securities and investments in equities including ETFs and are valued in accordance with the requirements of the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB's ASC
820.   The securities classified as equity securities reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets are valued at market and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income per FASB Accounting Standards Update
No.
2016 - 01
("ASU
2016 - 01" ).  The securities classified as available-for-sale  fixed income securities reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets are valued at market and unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Investment gains and losses on sales of the equity securities are the difference between proceeds from sales and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later.  Investment gains and losses on sales of the available-for-sale fixed income securities are the difference between proceeds from sales and the cost of the securities.  Investment gains and losses on sales of the securities are recorded in earnings as of the trade date and are determined on the identified cost method.
The Company classifies its equity securities and available-for-sale fixed income securities as current assets to properly reflect its liquidity and to recognize the fact that it has liquid assets available-for-sale should the need arise.
Market valuations of securities listed on a securities exchange and ETF shares are based on the closing sales prices on the last business day of each month. The market value of the Company's fixed maturity U.S. Government debt securities is determined utilizing publicly quoted market prices.  Cash equivalents consist of investments in money market funds that invest primarily in U.S. Government securities valued in accordance with rule
2a - 7
under the
1940
Act.
The Fair Value Measurements Topic of FASB's ASC defines fair value as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment in a timely transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment. The  Fair Value Measurements Topic established a
three -tier hierarchy to maximize the use of observable market data and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to the information that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Examples of risks include those inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value such as the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Inputs are classified as observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the factors market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.

Income Taxes:
The Company computes its income tax provision in accordance with the Income Tax Topic of the FASB's ASC.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book values and the tax bases of particular assets and liabilities, using tax rates currently in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The Company adopted the provisions of ASU
2015 - 17,
Income taxes (Topic
740 ) and classifies all deferred taxes as long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.
The Income Tax Topic of the FASB's ASC establishes for all entities, a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of positions taken in filing tax returns (including whether an entity is taxable in a particular jurisdiction), and requires certain expanded tax disclosures.  As of
January 31, 2023,
management has reviewed the tax positions for the years still subject to tax audit under the statute of limitations, evaluated the implications, and determined that there is
no
material impact to the Company's financial statements.
Earnings per share:
Earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during each period. Any shares that are reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they are outstanding.  The Company does
not
have any potentially dilutive common shares from outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted stock, or restricted stock units.
For purposes of the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all cash held at banks and short term liquid investments with an original maturity of less than
three
months to be cash and cash equivalents. As of
January 31, 2023
and
April 30, 2022,
cash equivalents included $ 11,233,000
and $ 28,965,000 , respectively, for amounts invested in money market mutual funds that invest in short term U.S. government securities.

Equity Method Investment:
As of
January 31, 2023
and
April 30, 2022,
the Company's investment in EAM Trust on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets was $ 58,827,000
and $ 59,971,000 , respectively.
The value of VLI’s investment in EAM at
January 31, 2023
and
April 30, 2022
reflects the fair value of contributed capital of $ 55,805,000
at inception which included $ 5,820,000
of cash and liquid securities in excess of working capital requirements contributed to EAM’s capital account by VLI, plus VLI's share of non-voting revenues and non-voting profits from EAM less distributions, made quarterly to VLI by EAM, during the period subsequent to its initial investment through the dates of the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.
It is anticipated that EAM will have sufficient liquidity and earn enough profit to conduct its current and future operations so the management of EAM will
not
need additional funding.
The Company monitors its Investment in EAM Trust for impairment to determine whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred that
may
have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.  Impairment indicators include, but are
not
limited to the following: (a) a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, (b) a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, (c) a significant adverse change in the general market condition of the industry in which the investee operates, or (d) factors that raise significant concerns about the investee’s ability to continue as a going concern such as negative cash flows, working capital deficiencies, or noncompliance with statutory capital and regulatory requirements.  EAM did
not
record any impairment losses for its assets during the fiscal years
2023
or
2022.

- Variable Interest Entity
The Company holds a  non-voting revenues interest and a
50 % non-voting profits interest in EAM, the adviser to the Value Line asset management and mutual fund distribution businesses.  EAM is considered to be a VIE in relation to the Company.  The Company makes its determination for consolidation of EAM as a VIE based on a qualitative assessment of the purpose and design of EAM, the terms and characteristics of the variable interests in EAM, and the risks EAM is designed to originate and pass through to holders of variable interests.  Other than EAM, the Company does
not
have an interest in any other VIEs.
The Company has determined that it does
not
have a controlling financial interest in EAM because it does
not
have the power to direct the activities of EAM that most significantly impact its economic performance.  Value Line does
not
hold any voting stock of EAM and it does
not
have any involvement in the day-to-day activities or operations of EAM.  Although the EAM Trust Agreement provides Value Line with certain consent rights and contains certain restrictive covenants related to the activities of EAM, these are considered to be protective rights and therefore Value Line does
not
maintain control over EAM.
In addition, although EAM is expected to be profitable, there is a risk that it could operate at a loss. While all of the profit interest shareholders in EAM are subject to variability based on EAM’s operations risk, Value Line’s non-voting revenues interest in EAM is a preferred interest in the revenues of EAM, rather than a profits interest in EAM, and Value Line accordingly believes it is subject to proportionately less risk than other holders of the profits interests.
The Company has
not
provided any explicit or implicit financial or other support to EAM other than what was contractually agreed to in the EAM Trust Agreement.  Value Line has
no
obligation to fund EAM in the future and, as a result, has
no
exposure to loss beyond its initial investment and any undistributed revenues and profits interests retained in EAM.  The following table presents the total assets of EAM, the maximum exposure to loss due to involvement with EAM, as well as the value of the assets and liabilities the Company has recorded on its Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets for its interest in EAM.

- Comprehensive Income:

Investment Management (overview):
The Company has substantial non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM, the asset manager to the Value Line Mutual Funds.  Accordingly, the Company does
not
report this operation as a separate business segment, although it maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by this business and receives non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests, as discussed below.
Total assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at
January 31, 2023,
were $ 3.04
billion,
31.1 % below total assets of $ 4.41
billion in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at
January 31, 2022.
The reduction in assets was due to a bear market in equities, and particularly in growth stocks in which EAM specializes, and to the termination of a lower-margin business in annuity funds.
The Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM entitle it to receive quarterly distributions in a range of
41 % to
55 % of EAM’s revenues (excluding distribution revenues) from EAM’s mutual fund and separate account business and
50 % of the residual profits of EAM (subject to temporary increase in certain limited circumstances).  The Voting Profits Interest Holders receive the other
50 % of residual profits of EAM.  Distribution is
not
less than
90 % of EAM’s profits payable each fiscal quarter under the provisions of the EAM Trust Agreement.
EAM Trust - VLI's non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests:
The Company holds non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM which entitle the Company to receive from EAM an amount ranging from
41 % to
55 % of EAM's investment management fee revenues from its mutual fund and separate accounts business.  EAM currently has
no
separately managed account fees.  The Company recorded income from its non-voting revenues interest and its non-voting profits interests in EAM as follows:

no
receivables from the Parent on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets at
January 31, 2023
and
April 30, 2022.
The Company is a party to a tax-sharing arrangement with the Parent which allocates the tax liabilities of the

On
December 22, 2017
H.R.
1,
originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), was enacted.  The Tax Act lowered the U.S. federal income tax rate ("Federal Tax Rate") from
35%
to
21%
effective
January 1, 2018.   Accordingly, the Company computes Federal income tax expense using the Federal Tax Rate of
21 % in fiscal year
2019
and each year thereafter.
The overall effective income tax rates, as a percentage of pre-tax ordinary income for the
nine
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
January 31, 2022
were
24.15 % and
20.94 %, respectively. The lower effective tax rate during
nine
months ended
January 31, 2022
as compared to
January 31, 2023,
is primarily a result of the non-taxable revenue derived from forgiveness of the PPP loan by the SBA during fiscal
2022
(see note
16 ). The higher effective tax rate during the
nine
months ended
January 31, 2023
as compared to
January 31, 2022,
is also due to an increase in the state and local income tax rate to
3.39 % from
2.11 % as a result of changes in state and local income tax allocations, the increase in additional states that the Company is subject to tax and the effect on deferred taxes in fiscal
2023.
The Company's annualized overall effective tax rate fluctuates due to a number of factors, in addition to changes in tax law, including but
not
limited to an increase or decrease in the ratio of items that do
not
have tax consequences to pre-income tax, the Company's geographic profit mix between tax jurisdictions, taxation method adopted by each locality, new interpretations of existing tax laws and rulings and settlements with tax authorities.
Deferred income taxes, a liability, are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities.  The tax effect of temporary differences giving rise to the Company's long-term deferred tax liability are as follows:

At the end of each interim reporting period, the Company estimates the effective income tax rate to apply for the full fiscal year. The Company uses the effective income tax rate determined to provide for income taxes on a year-to-date basis and reflects the tax effect of any tax law changes and certain other discrete events in the period in which they occur.
The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory income tax rate to pretax income as a result of the following:
Nine Months Ended January 31,
2023

U.S. statutory federal tax rate

- Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use:
The Company has adopted the provisions of the Statement of Position
98 - 1
(SOP
98 - 1 ), "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use".  SOP
98 - 1
requires companies to capitalize as long-lived assets many of the costs associated with developing or purchasing software for internal use and amortize those costs over the software's estimated useful life in a systematic and rational manner.  Such costs, when incurred, are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the asset, normally
3
to
5
years.  Total amortization expenses during the
nine
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
January 31, 2022,
were $ 36,000
and $ 59,000 , respectively.

- Lease Commitments:
In
February 2016,
the FASB issued ASU
No.
2016 - 02,
“Leases (Topic
842 )”.  This ASU requires that, for leases longer than
one
year, a lessee recognizes in the statements of financial position a right-of-use asset, representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability, representing the liability to make lease payments. It also requires that for finance leases, a lessee recognizes interest expense on the lease liability, separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statements of earnings, while for operating leases, such amounts should be recognized as a combined expense. The firm adopted this ASU in
May 2019
under a modified retrospective approach.
The Company adopted ASU
2016 - 02
using a modified retrospective transition approach as of the Effective Date as permitted by the amendments in ASU
2018 - 11,
which provides an alternative modified retrospective transition method. As a result, the Company was
not
required to adjust its comparative period financial information for effects of the standard or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the date of adoption (i.e.
May 1, 2019).
The Company has elected to employ the transitionary relief offered by the FASB and, therefore, has
not
reassessed ( 1 ) whether existing or expired contracts contain a lease, ( 2 ) lease classification for existing or expired leases or ( 3 ) the accounting for initial direct costs that were previously capitalized.
The Company leases office space in New York, NY and a warehouse and appurtenant office space in Lyndhurst, NJ. The Company has evaluated these leases and determined that they are operating leases under the definitions of the guidance of ASU
2016 - 02.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. For operating leases, the right-of-use asset is subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received.
On
May 1, 2019,
the Company recorded a right-of-use asset in the amount of $ 9,575,000 , which represents the lease liability of $ 10,340,000
adjusted for previously recorded unamortized lease incentives in the amount of $ 765,000 . The right-of-use asset is amortized over the remaining lease term in the amount equal to the difference between the calculated straight-line expense of the total lease payments less the monthly interest calculated on the remaining lease liability. As of
January 31, 2023,
the Company had a long-term lease asset of $ 5,591,000
recorded in property and equipment in its Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.
The Company recognizes lease expense, calculated as the remaining cost of the lease allocated over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis. Lease expense is presented as part of continuing operations in the consolidated condensed statements of income. The Company recognized $ 750,000
in lease expenses in both fiscal years
2023
and
2022
during the
nine
months ended
January 31, 2023
and
January 31, 2022,
respectively.
For the
nine
months ended
January 31, 2023,
the Company paid $ 1,193,000
in rent relating to the leases. As a payment arising from an operating lease, the $ 1,193,000
is classified within operating activities in the consolidated condensed statements of cash flows.
The Company’s leases generally do
not
provide an implicit interest rate, and therefore the Company estimated an incremental borrowing rate, or IBR, as of the commencement date, to determine the present value of its operating lease liabilities. The IBR is defined under ASC
842
as the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The following table reconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments to the total operating lease liabilities recognized on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet as of

- Restricted Cash and Deposits:
Restricted Money Market Investment in the noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet at
January 31, 2023,
includes $ 305,000 , which represents cash invested in a bank money market fund securing a letter of credit ("LOC") in the amount of $ 305,000
issued to the sublandlord as a security deposit for the Company's New York City leased corporate office facility.  According to the sublease agreement the LOC and restricted cash were reduced from $ 469,000

Note

- Concentration of Credit Risk:
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to
$250,000.
As of
January 31, 2023
and
January 31, 2022,
the Company had $ 2,427,000
and $ 3,030,000 , respectively, in excess of the FDIC insured limit.  Management has concluded the excess does
not
represent a material risk, based on the creditworthiness  of the counter parties.
The Company maintains a deposit account of $ 305,000
at Signature Bank as security for a letter of credit in a similar amount (See Note
13 ). The bank was closed
March 12, 2023
by its state chartering authority. In a joint statement of the U.S. Treasury department, the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, these federal entities confirmed that all depositors of this institution will be made whole.

- Paycheck Protection Program Loan:
Shortly after declaration of the COVID- 19
pandemic and "lockdowns" of numerous non-essential businesses, the Company in
April
of
2020
executed a note and received a loan (the "PPP Loan") from JP Morgan Chase Bank under the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act") and was administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA").  The proceeds from the PPP Loan were used in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act program.
Under the terms of the CARES Act, Borrowers could apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the PPP Loan.  Such forgiveness is determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act.  The Company was granted total loan forgiveness of $ 2,331,365
by the SBA during the
second
quarter of fiscal
2022.   Accrued interest was also forgiven.

Value Line markets under well-known brands including
Value Line ® , the Value Line
logo®,
The Value Line Investment Survey ® , Smart Research, Smarter Investing ™
and
The Most Trusted Name in Investment Research ® .
The name "Value Line" as used to describe the Company, its products, and its subsidiaries, is a registered trademark of the Company. EULAV Asset Management Trust (“EAM”) was established to provide the investment management services to the Value Line Funds, institutional and individual accounts and provide distribution, marketing, and administrative services to the Value Line® Mutual Funds ("Value Line Funds"). The Company maintains a significant investment in EAM from which it receives payments in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests.
The Company’s target audiences within the investment research field are individual investors, colleges, libraries, and investment management professionals. Individuals come to Value Line for complete research in one package. Institutional licensees consist of corporations, financial professionals, colleges, and municipal libraries. Libraries and universities offer the Company’s detailed research to their patrons and students. Investment management professionals use the research and historical information in their day-to-day businesses. The Company has a dedicated department that solicits institutional subscriptions.
Payments received for new and renewal subscriptions and the value of receivables for amounts billed to retail and institutional customers are recorded as unearned revenue until the order is fulfilled. As the orders are fulfilled, the Company recognizes revenue in equal installments over the life of the particular subscription. Accordingly, the subscription fees to be earned by fulfilling subscriptions after the date of a particular balance sheet are shown on that balance sheet as unearned revenue within current and long-term liabilities.
The investment periodicals and related publications (retail and institutional) and Value Line copyrights and Value Line Proprietary Ranks and other proprietary information consolidate into one segment called Publishing. The Publishing segment constitutes the Company’s only reportable business segment.
Asset Management and Mutual Fund Distribution Businesses
Pursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company maintains an interest in certain revenues of EAM and a portion of the residual profits of EAM but has no voting authority with respect to the election or removal of the trustees of EAM or control of its business.
The business of EAM is managed by its trustees each owning 20% of the voting profits interest in EAM and by its officers subject to the direction of the trustees. The Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM entitle it to receive a range of 41% to 55% of EAM’s revenues (excluding distribution revenues) from EAM’s mutual fund and separate account business and 50% of the residual profits of EAM (subject to temporary increase in certain limited circumstances). The Voting Profits Interest Holders will receive the other 50% of residual profits of EAM. Distribution is not less than 90% of EAM’s profits payable each fiscal quarter under the provisions of the EAM Trust Agreement.

Business Environment
The U.S. economy continued to rebound in the 2022 fourth quarter, with the gross domestic product (GDP) expanding by an annualized rate of 2.7%. This followed an annualized increase of 2.6% in the third quarter and two quarterly contractions to start 2022, with output in the first half of the year hurt by the spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant at the turn of the calendar and the fact that inventory buildups were pulled forward (into the fourth quarter of 2021), as manufacturers worried about supply-chain disruptions. The fourth-quarter GDP reading, much like the third-period figure, did have some worrisome signs, including the slowing pace of growth in the consumer sector and a sharp drop in residential construction, but still-strong jobs creation to both end 2022 and begin 2023 were positive signs as the new year unfolds.
Meantime, the central bank remains aggressive in raising interest rates. The Federal Reserve at its early February Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting increased the benchmark short-term interest rate by 0.25%, to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%. This raised the federal funds rate by more than four full percentage points since the Fed began tightening monetary policy in early 2022. The increasingly restrictive monetary policy course has been accompanied by hawkish commentary from senior Federal Reserve officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell. The consensus opinion among Fed monetary policy makers is that the federal funds rate will ultimately need to move comfortably above the 5.00% mark this year and stay at that level for an extended duration to reduce demand for goods and services enough to drive prices significantly lower and effectively fight inflation. Stronger-than-expected January Consumer and Producer Price Indexes readings suggested such actions will be necessary.
In general, the Federal Reserve’s efforts to slow demand are working, with the Federal Reserve noting some disinflation in the goods sector. It should also be noted that consumer credit card balances, with significantly higher interest rates, recently stood at just shy of the $1 trillion mark. This may force the consumer to reassess their spending habits when the credit card bills start to come due later this year. Meanwhile, the pace of residential construction (the biggest contributor to GDP after the consumer sector), continues to decline, with both housing starts and building permits down more than 20%, year over year, in January. Significantly higher borrowing costs are leading to a drop in housing affordability.
In conclusion, the aggressive monetary policy tightening stance by the Federal Reserve may ultimately push the U.S. economy into a recession. The continued inversion of the Treasury market yield curve (occurs when rates on longer-term obligations are lower than those of shorter-tern durations) and sharp reduction in the U.S. money supply may be an indication of some economic challenges ahead. This would make for a tougher near-term operating environment for both businesses and consumers.

Unearned subscription revenue as of January 31, 2023, is 4.2% below April 30, 2022 and 1.7% below January 31, 2022. A certain amount of variation is to be expected due to the volume of new orders and timing of long-term renewal contracts, direct mail campaigns and large Institutional Sales orders.

Investment periodicals and related publications revenues
Investment periodicals and related publications revenues of $19,795,000 (excluding copyright fees) during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 were 2.8% below publishing revenues of $20,361,000, as compared to the prior fiscal year. The Company continued activity to attract new subscribers, primarily digital subscriptions through various marketing channels, primarily direct mail, e-mail, and by the efforts of our sales personnel. As fewer individual investors manage their own portfolios, total product line circulation at January 31, 2023, was 10.5% below total product line circulation at January 31, 2022. However, during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, Institutional Sales department total sales orders, representing our growing business with financial advisors and professional investors, of $11,025,000 were 21.4% above the prior fiscal year. The retail telemarketing sales team generated total sales orders of $5,511,000 or 8.1% below the prior fiscal year.
Total print circulation at January 31, 2023 was 16.6% below the total print circulation at January 31, 2022. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, print publication revenues of $7,539,000, decreased 10.1%, below print publication revenues of $8,389,000 during January of 2022 because we deferred advertising in light of negative sentiment among prospective individual customers in a challenging market environment. Total digital circulation at January 31, 2023 was 1.5% below total digital circulation at January 31, 2022 with the professional clientele offsetting individual subscribers. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, digital revenues of $12,256,000 were up 2.4% as compared to the prior fiscal year. These figures reflect weak investor sentiment, likely temporary, and the ongoing shift from our print services to digital counterparts. Further, publishing revenue is fairly steady, despite the dip in print circulation. Sales of our higher-price, higher-profit, publications have been stronger than sales of lower price “starter” products.
Value Line serves primarily individual and professional investors in stocks, who pay mostly on annual subscription plans, for basic services or as much as $100,000 or more annually for comprehensive premium quality research, not obtainable elsewhere. The ongoing goal of adding new subscribers has led us to introduce publications and packages at a range of price points.
The Value Line Proprietary Ranks (the “Ranking System”), a component of the Company’s flagship product,
The Value Line Investment Survey , are also utilized in the Company’s copyright business. The Ranking System is made available to EAM for specific uses without charge. During the six month period ended February 21, 2023, the combined Ranking System “Rank 1 & 2” stocks’ increase of 1.9% compared to the Russell 2000 Index’s decrease of 1.4% during the comparable period.
Copyright fees
During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, copyright fees of $10,182,000 were 1.5% above those during the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year.
Investment management fees and services

(unconsolidated)
The Company has substantial non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM, the asset manager to the Value Line Mutual Funds. Accordingly, the Company does not report this operation as a separate business segment, although it maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by this business and will receive ongoing payments in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests.
Total assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at January 31, 2023, were $3.04 billion, which is $1.37 billion, or 31.1%, below total assets of $4.41 billion in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at January 31, 2022. The decrease in net assets was primarily due to fund shareholder redemptions, closing of two variable annuity funds, and significant declines during the 2022 bear market.

EAM Trust - Results of operations before distribution to interest holders
The gross fees and net income of EAM’s investment management operations during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, before interest holder distributions, included total investment management fees earned from the Value Line Funds of $14,951,000, 12b-1 fees and other fees of $4,507,000 and other net gains of $150,000. For the same period, total investment management fee waivers were $104,000 and 12b-1 fee waivers were $80,000. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, EAM's net income was $1,198,000 after giving effect to Value Line’s non-voting revenues interest of $7,917,000, but before distributions to voting profits interest holders and to the Company in respect of its 50% non-voting profits interest.
The gross fees and net income of EAM’s investment management operations during the nine months ended January 31, 2022, before interest holder distributions, included total investment management fees earned from the Value Line Funds of $23,306,000, 12b-1 fees and other fees of $7,303,000 and other net income of $49,000. For the same period, total investment management fee waivers were $402,000 and 12b-1 fee waivers for three Value Line Funds were $342,000. During the nine months ended January 31, 2022, EAM's net income was $3,640,000 after giving effect to Value Line’s non-voting revenues interest of $12,532,000, but before distributions to voting profits interest holders and to the Company in respect of its 50% non-voting profits interest.
As of January 31, 2023, one of the Value Line Funds has full 12b-1 fees waivers in place, and six funds have partial investment management fee waivers in place. Although, under the terms of the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company does not receive or share in the revenues from 12b-1 distribution fees, the Company could benefit from the fee waivers to the extent that the resulting reduction of expense ratios and enhancement of the performance of the Value Line Funds attracts new assets.
The Value Line equity and hybrid funds’ assets represent 98.6% and fixed income fund assets represent 1.4%, respectively, of total fund assets under management (“AUM”) as of January 31, 2023. At January 31, 2023, equity and hybrid AUM decreased by 43.0% and fixed income AUM decreased by 20.0% as compared to last year at January 31, 2022.

During the nine months ended January 31, 2022, the Company’s investment gains, primarily derived from dividend and interest income, investment gains and losses recognized on sales of equity securities during the period and unrealized gains recognized on equity securities held at the end of the period in fiscal 2022, resulted in a gain of $759,000. Proceeds from maturities and sales of government debt securities classified as available-for-sale during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, were $9,907,000 and $2,496,000, respectively. Proceeds from the sales of equity securities during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 were $1,421,000 and $1,202,000, respectively.
30
Effective income tax rate
The overall effective income tax rates, as a percentage of pre-tax ordinary income for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022 were 24.15% and 20.94%, respectively. The lower effective income tax rate during the nine months ended January 31, 2022 as compared to January 31, 2023, is primarily a result of the non-taxable revenue derived from forgiveness of the PPP loan by the SBA during fiscal 2022 (see note 16). The higher effective tax rate during the nine months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to January 31, 2022, is also a result of an increase in the state and local income taxes to 3.39% from 2.11% as a result of changes in state and local income tax allocations, the increase in additional states that the Company is taxed in and the effect on deferred taxes in fiscal 2023. The Company's annualized overall effective tax rate fluctuates due to a number of factors, in addition to changes in tax law, including but not limited to an increase or decrease in the ratio of items that do not have tax consequences to pre-income tax, the Company's geographic profit mix between tax jurisdictions, taxation method adopted by each locality, new interpretations of existing tax laws and rulings and settlements with tax authorities.
Lease Commitments
On November 30, 2016, Value Line, Inc. received consent from the landlord at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY to the terms of a new sublease agreement between Value Line, Inc. and ABM Industries, Incorporated commencing on December 1, 2016. Pursuant to the agreement Value Line leased from ABM 24,726 square feet of office space located on the second and third floors at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY (“Building” or “Premises”) beginning on December 1, 2016 and ending on November 29, 2027. Base rent under the sublease agreement is $1,126,000 per annum during the first year with an annual increase in base rent of 2.25% scheduled for each subsequent year, payable in equal monthly installments on the first day of each month, subject to customary concessions in the Company’s favor and pass-through of certain increases in utility costs and real estate taxes over the base year. The Company provided a security deposit represented by a letter of credit in the amount of $469,000 in October 2016, which was reduced to $305,000 on October 3, 2021, which we expect will be fully refunded after the sublease ends. This Building became the Company’s new corporate office facility. The Company is required to pay for certain operating expenses associated with the Premises as well as utilities supplied to the Premises. The sublease terms provide for a significant decrease (23% initially) in the Company’s annual rental expenditure taking into account free rent for the first six months of the sublease. The Sublandlord provided Value Line a work allowance of $417,000 which accompanied with the six months free rent worth $563,000 was applied against the Company’s obligation to pay rent at our NYC headquarters, delaying the actual rent payments until November 2017.
On February 29, 2016, the Company’s subsidiary VLDC and Seagis Property Group LP (the “Landlord”) entered into a lease agreement, pursuant to which VLDC has leased 24,110 square feet of warehouse and appurtenant office space located at 205 Chubb Ave., Lyndhurst, NJ (“Warehouse”) beginning on May 1, 2016 and ending on April 30, 2024 (“Lease”). Base rent under the Lease is $192,880 per annum payable in equal monthly installments on the first day of each month, in advance during fiscal 2017 and will gradually increase to $237,218 in fiscal 2024, subject to customary increases based on operating costs and real estate taxes. The Company provided a security deposit in cash in the amount of $32,146, which we expect will be fully refunded after the lease term expires. The lease is a net lease requiring the Company to pay for certain operating expenses associated with the Warehouse as well as utilities supplied to the Warehouse.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $41,608,000 as of January 31, 2023 and $37,580,000 as of April 30, 2022. These amounts include short-term unearned revenue of $16,531,000 and $17,688,000 reflected in total current liabilities at January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively. Cash and short-term securities were $60,777,000 and $57,825,000 as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively.
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents include $11,233,000 and $28,965,000 at January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively, invested primarily in commercial banks and in Money Market Funds at brokers, which operate under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act and invest primarily in short-term U.S. government securities.
31
Cash from operating activities
The Company had cash inflows from operating activities of $13,978,000 during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, compared to cash inflows from operations of $19,627,000 during the nine months ended January 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease in cash flows from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 is primarily attributable to lower net income, a decrease in cash receipts from EAM, the timing of customers’ payments and the timing of Federal Income tax payments.
Cash from investing activities
The Company had cash outflows from investing activities of $20,222,000 during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, compared to cash outflows from investing activities of $1,614,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2022, respectively. Cash outflows for the nine months ended January 31, 2023, were primarily due to increases in purchases of U.S. treasury bills and fixed income securities in fiscal year 2023.
Cash from financing activities
During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company’s cash outflows from financing activities were $11,598,000, compared to cash outflows from financing activities of $7,439,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2022. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, cash outflows for financing activities included $4,487,000 for the repurchase of 70,981 shares of the Company’s common stock under the May 31, 2022 and October 21, 2022 board approved common stock repurchase programs. Quarterly dividend payments of $0.25 per share during fiscal year 2023 aggregated $7,111,000. Quarterly regular dividend payments of $0.22 per share during fiscal year 2022 aggregated $6,307,000.
At January 31, 2023 there were 9,438,862 common shares outstanding as compared to 9,529,163 common shares outstanding at January 31, 2022. The Company expects financing activities to continue to include use of cash for dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
Debt and Liquid Assets
Management believes that the Company’s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its business together with the tax free proceeds from the SBA PPP loan, which debt has been forgiven, and the future cash flows from operations and from the Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM will be sufficient to finance current and forecasted liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond. Management does not anticipate making any borrowings during the next twelve months. As of January 31, 2023, retained earnings and liquid assets were $94,588,000 and $60,777,000, respectively. As of April 30, 2022, retained earnings and liquid assets were $87,645,000 and $57,825,000, respectively. There are no off-balance-sheet arrangements, so none affect the interpretations of reported assets, liquidity, and debt.
Seasonality
Our publishing revenues are comprised of subscriptions which are generally annual subscriptions. Our cash flows from operating activities are minimally seasonal in nature, primarily due to the timing of customer payments made for orders and subscription renewals.
32
Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
The Company prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as in effect in the United States (U.S. “GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent, and the Company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The Company’s critical accounting policy relates to the valuation of EAM. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended January 31, 2023. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended April 30, 2022.
Contractual Obligations
We are a party to lease contracts which will result in cash payments to landlords in future periods. Operating lease liabilities are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter are (in thousands): $404 (remaining three months) in 2023; $1,634 in 2024; $1,429 in 2025; $1,461 in 2026; $1,493 in 2027 and $882 thereafter totaling $7,303.
33
Item 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Market Risk Disclosures
The Company’s Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet includes a substantial amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risks. The Company’s market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity price risk. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with the Company’s investment activities.
Interest Rate Risk
The Company’s strategy has been to acquire debt securities with low credit risk. Despite this strategy management recognizes and accepts the possibility that losses may occur. To limit the price fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes, the Company’s management invests primarily in short-term obligations maturing within one year.
The fair values of the Company’s fixed maturity investments will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, and other general market conditions.
Fixed income securities consist of bank certificates of deposits and securities issued by federal, state and local governments within the United States. As of January 31, 2023 the aggregate cost and fair value of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were $30,802,000 and $30,930,000, respectively. As of April 30, 2022 the aggregate cost and fair value of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were $10,505,000 and $10,475,000, respectively.
The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets that are subject to interest rate risk. It is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks. The hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table.

Management regularly monitors the maturity structure of the Company’s investments in debt securities in order to maintain an acceptable price risk associated with changes in interest rates.
34
Equity Price Risk
The carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet dates. Market prices are subject to fluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. Furthermore, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold.
The Company’s equity investment strategy has been to acquire equity securities across a diversity of industry groups. The portfolio consists of ETFs held for dividend yield that attempt to replicate the performance of certain equity indexes and ETFs that hold preferred shares primarily of financial institutions. In order to maintain liquidity in these securities, the Company’s policy has been to invest in and hold in its portfolio, no more than 5% of the approximate average daily trading volume in any one issue.
As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the aggregate cost of the equity securities, which consist of investments in the SPDR Series Trust S&P Dividend ETF (SDY), First Trust Value Line Dividend Index ETF (FVD), ProShares Trust S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), IShares DJ Select Dividend ETF (DVY), and other Exchange Traded Funds and common stock equity securities was a combined total $13,217,000 and $13,318,000, respectively, and the fair value was $17,986,000 and $17,647,000, respectively.

Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a)
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.
The Company’s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Company’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
(b)
The registrant’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have determined that there have been no changes in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.
