NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021
1. ORGANIZATION AND LINE OF BUSINESS
Organization
NovAccess Global Inc. (“NovAccess,” the “Company” or the “issuer”) is a Colorado corporation formerly known as Sun River Mining Inc. and XsunX, Inc.). The Company was originally incorporated in Colorado on February 25, 1997. Effective September 24, 2003, the Company completed a plan of reorganization and name change to XsunX, Inc. Effective August 25, 2020, we filed articles of amendment to our articles of incorporation with the Colorado Secretary of State to: effectuate a
1-for-1,000
reverse stock split of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock; and change the name of the Company to “NovAccess Global Inc.” After completing the acquisition of StemVax, in September, 2020, we exited the solar business and focused all our efforts on our biopharmaceutical business.
Line of Business
NovAccess Global Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that is developing novel immunotherapies to treat brain tumor patients in the United States with plans to expand globally. We specialize in cutting-edge research related to utilizing a patient’s own immune system to attack the cancer. We are filing an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) and working closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to obtain approval for human clinical trials to determine safety and efficacy of our drug product for brain cancer patients. Once we have successfully completed the clinical trials and proven that the new therapy is safe and efficacious, we plan to commercialize the product. We also have expertise in successfully executing clinical trials, bringing products to market and increasing the market size of products through our advisory board. Our scientists are well versed in immunology, stem cell biology, neuroscience, molecular biology, imaging, small molecules development, gene therapy and other technical assays needed for protein and genetic analysis of cancer cells.
NovAccess operates as a research and development (R&D) company out of Ohio and California, and our executive management and scientific advisory board provide over 15 years of extensive experience in all aspects of biopharmaceutical R&D and commercialization of drug candidates.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The Company does not generate significant revenue, and has negative cash flows from operations, which raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon, among other things, additional cash infusion. The Company has obtained funds from its shareholders since its inception through the period ended December 31, 2022. Management believes the existing shareholders and the prospective new investors will provide the additional cash needed to meet the Company’s obligations as they become due and will allow the development of its business.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
This summary of significant accounting policies of NovAccess Global Inc. is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary StemVax, LLC. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions between these entities have been eliminated in these consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates made in preparing these consolidated financial statements include the estimate of the deferred tax valuation allowance, the fair value of stock options, and derivative liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and money markets with an original maturity of three months or less.
Stock-Based Compensation
Share-based Payment applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are to follow a fair value of those equity instruments. We are required to follow a fair value approach using an option-pricing model, such as the Binomial lattice valuation model, at the date of a stock option grant. The deferred compensation calculated under the fair value method would then be amortized over the respective vesting period of the stock option. This has not had a material impact on our results of operations.
Net Earnings (Loss) per Share Calculations
Net earnings (Loss) per share dictates the calculation of basic earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the effect of stock options and stock-based awards plus the assumed conversion of convertible debt (see notes 4 and 5).

Diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding (Denominator)

14,460,284
Diluted weighted average number of shares for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is the same as basic weighted average number of shares because the Company had net losses for both quarters.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair Value of Financial Instruments requires disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, where it is practicable to estimate that value. As of December 31, 2022, the balances reported for cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses approximate the fair value because of their short maturities.
We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820 for financial instruments measured as fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, established a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued)
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include:
●
Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;
●
Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and
●
Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
We measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company had no assets that are required to be valued on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. The Company had liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis as follows at December 31 and September 30, 2022:

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2022-04, "Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations". This guidance requires annual and interim disclosures for entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We are currently evaluating the extent of the impact of this ASU, but do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sales Restrictions, which (1) clarifies the guidance in Topic 820 on the fair value measurement of an equity security that is subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security and (2) requires specific disclosures related to such an equity security. We are currently evaluating the extent of the impact of this ASU, but do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures ("ASU 2022-02"). ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings for creditors in ASC Topic 310 and amends the guidance on "vintage disclosures" to require disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination. ASU 2022-02 also updates the requirements related to accounting for credit losses under ASC Topic 326 and adds enhanced disclosures for creditors with respect to loan refinancings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. ASU 2022-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the extent of the impact of this ASU, but do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.
3. CAPITAL STOCK
As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s authorized stock consisted of

We evaluated the financing transactions in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and determined that the conversion feature of the convertible promissory notes was not afforded the exemption for conventional convertible instruments due to its variable conversion rate. The notes have no explicit limit on the number of shares issuable so they did not meet the conditions set forth in current accounting standards for equity classification. The Company elected to recognize the notes under paragraph 815-15-25-4, whereby, there would be a separation into a host contract and derivative instrument. The Company elected to initially and subsequently measure the notes in their entirety at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The Company recorded a derivative liability representing the imputed interest associated with the embedded derivative. The derivative liability is adjusted periodically according to the stock price fluctuations based upon the Binomial lattice model calculation.
The convertible notes issued and described this Note do not have fixed settlement provisions because their conversion prices are not fixed. The conversion feature has been characterized as a derivative liability to be re-measured at the end of every reporting period with the change in value reported in the statement of operations.
We record the full value of the derivative as a liability at issuance with an offset to valuation discount, which will be amortized over the life of the notes.

14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
January 23 Letter Agreement
The Company, previously entered into three securities purchase agreements dated August 20, 2021, February 15, 2022, and May 5, 2022 (collectively, the “Agreements”), with AJB Capital Investments, LLC (“AJB”). Pursuant to the Agreements, the Company issued promissory notes to AJB representing loans provided by AJB to the Company totaling $ 1,750,000 . Also pursuant to the Agreements, the Company paid AJB commitment fees totaling
1,575,000
unregistered shares of the company’s common stock (the “commitment fee shares”). If AJB is unable to sell the commitment fee shares for amounts specified in the Agreements, then AJB may require NovAccess to issue additional shares or pay cash in the amount of the shortfall (the “make-whole rights”). However, AJB may only exercise its make-whole rights within time frames following the loan dates specified in the Agreements (the August 20, 2021 and February 15, 2022 make-whole rights each have a term of
18
months and the May 5, 2022 make-whole rights have a term of
36
months). The August 20, 2021 make-whole rights expire on February 20 of this year. To avoid forcing AJB to sell the commitment fee shares in order to take advantage of its make-whole rights, on January 20, 2023 the Company entered into a letter agreement with AJB extending the exercise period for the make whole-rights to
72
months. As amended by the letter agreement, the make-whole rights now expire on August 20, 2027, February 15, 2028, and May 5, 2028. The letter agreement makes additional less material revisions to AJB’s make-whole rights and harmonizes the make-whole rights among the Agreements.
February 9, Letter Agreement
On May 5, 2022, the Company issued a promissory note to AJB in the principal amount of $ 1,000,000
in connection with loan from AJB. On February 9, 2023, AJB provided additional loan of $ 265,000 , which was added to the May 2022 note. The $265,000 has an original issuance discount of
10 % of the principal and bears interest at
10 % a year. This loan is due on May 9, 2023. The Company will use the proceeds of the loan for general working capital purposes. The chief executive officer Dwain K. Irvin guaranteed repayment of the $ 265,000
loan.
Also pursuant to the letter agreement, the Company paid AJB a commitment fee of
500,000
unregistered shares of the company’s common stock (the “commitment fee shares”). If AJB is unable to sell the commitment fee shares for $ 0.20
a share, then AJB may require the Company to issue additional shares or pay cash in the amount of the shortfall. The Company is also required to register the commitment fee shares for resale under the Securities Act.
Pursuant to the letter agreement, the Company also issued to AJB a common stock purchase warrant (the “warrant”) to purchase
1,000,000
shares of the company’s common stock for $ 0.20
a share. The warrant expires on February 9, 2028. Additionally the warrants issued previously in connection with the August 2021 and February 2022 notes with an exercise price of $ 1.50
per share were repriced to $ 0.20
per share.
Related Party Loan
On February 9, 2023, the Company entered into an interest-free loan agreement with Jason M. Anderson, an independent member of the board of directors. Mr. Anderson loaned the company $ 8,500 .
The loan does not bear interest (except on default) and is due on the earlier of August 31, 2023 or on receipt of debt or equity financing of at least $3.0 million.
The Company will use the proceeds of the loan for general working capital purposes.

Item 2. Management ’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Cautionary and Forward-Looking Statements
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed in this Quarterly Report and under
“ Item 1A: Risk Factors ”
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022.
We undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this report. Readers should carefully review the factors described in other documents that the Company files from time to time with the SEC.
Business Plan
In 2020, we transitioned our operations from solar contracting operations to the commercialization of developmental healthcare solutions in the biotechnology, medical, and health and wellness markets. On June 2, 2020, we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with Innovest Global, Inc. to acquire StemVax for 7.5 million shares of our unregistered common stock. The acquisition was completed on September 8, 2020.
StemVax, LLC (“StemVax”) is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for brain tumor patients that holds an exclusive patent license from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California (Cedars-Sinai) known as StemVax Glioblast (SVX-GB/TLR-AD1). TLR-AD1 specifically targets glioblastoma, the most common and lethal type of adult brain tumor. Christopher Wheeler, President of StemVax, has been involved in the pre-clinical research and development of the drug candidate at Cedars-Sinai Department of Neurosurgery since 1997. Dr. Wheeler began preparing the pre-IND application to obtain FDA approval to start human clinical trials. In 2021, Dr. Wheeler led pre-IND interactions with the FDA and obtained a recommended roadmap from the FDA to facilitate the filing of an IND application for a Phase I application or a Phase IIa application. We are currently executing on their recommendations and plan to submit an IND application in 2023. In August 2022, we filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for orphan drug designation (“ODD”) for TLR-AD1, which was granted in October 2022. Receiving ODD status represents a milestone in the development of TLR-AD1 and provides us with multiple incentives, including seven-year marketing exclusivity and federal tax credits, among other benefits.
We believe that investing in the biotechnology industry will significantly increase value for our shareholders. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this endeavor or that we can locate, acquire and finance the acquisition of biotechnology companies.
Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022, Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2021
Revenue and Cost of Sales
We are in research and development phase, and generated no revenue or cost of goods sold in the three months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by $202,225 during the three months ended December 31, 2022, to $482,155 as compared to $279,930 for the three months ended December 31,2021. The increase in SG&A expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2022, was related primarily due to the increase in professional fees by $245,819 due to new consulting agreements entered into in the quarter ended December 31, 2022, increase in the insurance costs by $41,304, increase in payroll costs by $12,832 partially offset by a decrease in outside services of $87,500 and stock-based compensation of $8,000.
Research and development expenses
The research and development expense marginally decreased by $7,436 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, to $34,963 as compared to $42,399 for the 2022 quarter. The primary reason for the decrease was on account of the decrease in costs for bio-technical services by $6,000.

Table of Contents
Other Income/(Expenses)
Other expenses increased by $2,293,309 from other income of $179,021 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 to other expenses of $2,114,288 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The change was primarily due to the increase in loss on change in derivative liability by $2,540,610 and decrease in gain on extinguishment of derivative liability amounting to $96,205. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded gain on account of the change in make whole provision on shares issued as Commitment fees amounting to $267,750 to partially offset the increase in other expenses. The increase was also partially offset by a decrease in interest expense by $75,756 during the current quarter. The estimates of fair market value are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price, volatility, variable conversion prices based on market prices defined in the respective agreements and probabilities of certain outcomes based on managements’ estimates. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period, therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material.
Net Loss
For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, our net loss was $2,631,406 as compared to a net loss of $143,308 for the same period in 2021. The increase in net loss of $2,488,098 was due to the increase in SG&A, and the increase in other expenses as described above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We had a working capital deficit at December 31, 2022 of $7,026,302, as compared to a working capital deficit of $4,653,066, as of September 30, 2022. The increase of $2,373,236 in the working capital deficit was the result of an increase in the derivative liability on convertible notes amounting to $2183,084, an increase in convertible notes payable of $249,862 an increase in accounts payable of $67,723, and a decrease in cash of $25,308. This was partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities amounting to $191,291, decrease in amounts due to related parties of $2,500 and by decrease in prepaid expenses of $41,050.
For the three months ended December 31, 2022, our cash flow used by operating activities was $159,307, as compared to cash flow used by operating activities of $190,070 for the three months ended December 3l, 2021. The decrease of $30,763 in cash flow used by operating activities was primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities described above as well as the decrease in net loss being primarily the result of non-cash charges recorded in the statement of operations.
Cash flow used by investing activities was $0 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Cash flow provided by financing activities was $134,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $34,301 during same period in 2021. The increase in cash flow provided by financing activities was primarily the result of the mix of funds raised by selling equity and debt instruments and repayment of convertible notes and bridge loans.
The Company will need to raise additional funds to finance its ongoing operations, complete its IND application to the FDA and to make payments under its loan agreements. We expect this will require at least $3.0 million through December 31, 2023. We plan to raise this capital through the issuance of additional common stock as well as obtaining additional debt as needed.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance-sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As a result, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates made in preparing these consolidated financial statements include the estimate of useful lives of property and equipment, the deferred tax valuation allowance, the fair value of stock options, and derivative liabilities. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Because NovAccess is a “smaller reporting company” as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission we are not required to provide additional market risk disclosure.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management team, with the participation of our chief executive officer, Dwain K. Irvin, and chief financial officer, Neil J. Laird, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of NovAccess’ disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Based upon this evaluation, Messrs. Irvin and Laird concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our senior management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, defined under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board, senior management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We continue to review our internal control over financial reporting and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business.
During the quarter the Company implemented enhanced review procedures for the accounting of certain derivatives and other income. This included engaging a third party to review the assumptions and calculation. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act that occurred during our first fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
