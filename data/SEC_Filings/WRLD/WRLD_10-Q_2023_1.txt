STATEMENTS   (Unaudited) NOTE 1 –
BASIS OF PRESENTATION The consolidated financial statements of the Company at December 31, 2022 and for the three and nine months then ended were prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management all adjustments (consisting only of items of a normal, recurring nature) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position at December 31, 2022, and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, have been included. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any other interim period. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The consolidated financial statements do not include all disclosures required by GAAP and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC. The Company applies the accounting policies contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022. The Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
NOTE 2 –
ASSETS HELD FOR SALE In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the Company moved its corporate headquarters from properties it owned outright in Greenville, South Carolina to leased office space in downtown Greenville, South Carolina. Under ASC 360-10, the properties met the criteria for classification as held for sale as of March 31, 2020. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021 the Company completed the sale of
two
of the
three
buildings held for sale. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company completed the sale of the last held for sale building, and recorded a $ 39.0  thousand loss on sale which is included as a component of Insurance and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, there were no assets held for sale. NOTE 3 –
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POLICIES Nature of Operations The Company is a small-loan consumer finance company headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina that offers short-term small loans, medium-term larger loans, related credit insurance products and ancillary products and services to individuals who have limited access to other sources of consumer credit. The Company offers income tax return preparation services to its loan customers and other individuals. Seasonality The Company's loan volume and corresponding loans receivable follow seasonal trends. The Company's highest loan demand generally occurs from October through December, its third fiscal quarter. Loan demand is generally lowest and loan repayment highest from January to March, its fourth fiscal quarter. Loan volume and average balances remain relatively level during the remainder of the year. Consequently, the Company experiences significant seasonal fluctuations in its operating results and cash needs. Operating results for the Company's third fiscal quarter are generally lower than in other quarters and operating results for its fourth fiscal quarter are generally higher than in other quarters. Loans receivable, net Loans receivable are carried at the gross amount outstanding, reduced by unearned interest and insurance income, net of deferred origination fees and direct costs, and an allowance for credit losses. Fees received and direct costs incurred for the origination of loans are deferred and amortized to interest income over the contractual lives of the loans using the interest method. Unamortized amounts are recognized in income at the time that loans are refinanced or paid in full except for those
12 Table of Contents refinancings that do not constitute a more than minor modification. Net unamortized deferred origination fees and costs were $ 5.6  million and $ 6.9  million as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. From time to time, the Company may sell charged off loans receivable, which are accounted for as a sale in accordance with ASC 860,
Transfers and Servicing . Allowance for credit losses Refer to Note 5, “Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses,” for information regarding the Company's CECL allowance model and a description of the methodology it utilizes. Reclassification Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income or shareholders' equity. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02,
Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures . The amendments in this update eliminate the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors in Subtopic 310-40,
Receivables—Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors , while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Additionally, for public business entities, the amendments in this update require that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326-20,
Financial Instruments—Credit Losses—Measured at Amortized Cost . For entities that have adopted the amendments in Update 2016-13, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied prospectively, with the exception of the transition method related to the recognition and measurement of troubled debt restructurings in which an entity has the option to apply a modified retrospective transition method. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this update will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We reviewed all other newly issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they are either not applicable to our business or are not expected to have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of future adoption. NOTE 4 –
FAIR VALUE Fair Value Disclosures The Company may carry certain financial instruments and derivative assets and liabilities at fair value measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company measures the fair values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value measurements are grouped in three levels. The levels prioritize the inputs used to measure the fair value of the assets or liabilities. These levels are: • Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for assets and liabilities, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are less active. • Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions. The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, loans receivable, net, senior notes payable, and senior unsecured notes payable. Loans receivable are originated at prevailing market rates and have an average life of approximately
8
months. Given the short-term nature of these loans, they are continually repriced at current market rates. The
13 Table of Contents Company’s revolving credit facility has a variable rate based on a margin over SOFR and reprices with any changes in SOFR. The fair value of the senior unsecured notes payable is estimated based on quoted prices in markets that are not active.

Amortized cost also includes interest earned but not collected. Credit Risk is inherent in the business of extending loans to borrowers and is continuously monitored by management and reflected within the allowance for credit losses for loans. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the Company’s gross loans receivable portfolio. In estimating the allowance for credit losses, loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into pools and collectively assessed. The Company’s loan products have generally the same terms therefore the Company looked to borrower characteristics as a way to disaggregate loans into pools sharing similar risks. In determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company examined four borrower risk metrics as noted below. 1. Borrower type 2. Active months 3. Prior loan performance 4. Customer Tenure To determine how well each metric predicts default risk the Company uses loss rate data over an observation period of twelve months at the loan level. The information value was then calculated for each metric. From this analysis management determined the metric that had the strongest predictor of default risk was Customer Tenure. The Customer Tenure buckets used in the allowance for credit loss calculation are: 1. 0 to 5 months 2. 6 to 17 months 3. 18 to 35 months 4. 36 to 59 months 5. 60+ months 18 Table of Contents Management will continue to monitor this credit metric on a quarterly basis. Management estimates an allowance for each Customer Tenure bucket by performing a historical migration analysis of loans in that bucket for the twelve most recent historical twelve-month migration periods, adjusted for seasonality. All loans that are greater than 90 days past due on a recency basis and not written off as of the reporting date are reserved for at 100% of the outstanding balance, net of a calculated Rehab Rate. Management considers whether current credit conditions might suggest a change is needed to the allowance for credit losses by monitoring trends in first pay success for new borrowers, 60-day delinquencies, FICO scores and average loan size as compared to metrics in the historical migration period. Due to the short term nature of the loan portfolio, forecasted changes in macroeconomic variables such as unemployment do not have a significant impact on loans outstanding at the end of a particular reporting period. Therefore, management develops a reasonable and supportable forecast of losses by comparing the most recent 6-month loss curves as compared to historical loss curves to see if there are significant changes in borrower behavior that may indicate the historical migration rates should be adjusted. Additionally, changes to the Company's customer underwriting guidelines are considered to forecast credit losses. If an adjustment is made as a result of the forecast, then the Company has elected to immediately revert back to historical experience past the forecast period.

Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the full payment of principal and collection of interest according to contractual terms is no longer likely. The accrual of interest is discontinued when a loan is 61 days or more past the contractual due date. When the interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed against interest income. While a loan is on nonaccrual status, interest revenue is recognized only when a payment is received. Once a loan moves to nonaccrual status, it remains in nonaccrual status until it is paid out, charged off or refinanced. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company reversed a total of $ 9.4
million and $ 9.7
million, respectively, of unpaid accrued interest against interest income. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company reversed a total of $ 29.9
million and $ 20.3
million, respectively, of unpaid accrued interest against interest income.
The following table presents the amortized cost basis of loans on nonaccrual status as of the beginning of the reporting period and the end of the reporting period, as well as year-to-date interest income recognized on nonaccrual loans for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Nonaccrual Loans Receivable Customer Tenure As of December 31, 2022 As of March 31, 2022 Interest Income Recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2022 Interest Income Recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2021 Interest Income Recognized for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 Interest Income Recognized for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 0 to 5 months $ 24,968,705   $ 45,227,510   $ 480,947   $ 293,649   $ 1,522,535   $ 858,871   6 to 17 months 23,995,420   15,879,250   450,877   325,759   1,216,091   1,151,316   18 to 35 months 21,946,855   20,745,106   544,689   504,974   1,741,780   1,414,201   36 to 59 months 22,662,926   14,232,388   555,085   325,291   1,575,766   978,378   60+ months 60,891,846   47,565,819   1,711,201   1,193,860   5,006,238   3,782,122   Tax advance loans 144,466   25,249   —   —   —   —   Unearned interest, insurance and fees ( 42,910,972 ) ( 38,026,011 ) —   —   —   —  Total $ 111,699,246   $ 105,649,311   $ 3,742,799   $ 2,643,533   $ 11,062,410   $ 8,184,888   As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, there were no loans receivable 61 days or more past due, not on nonaccrual status, and no loans receivable with no related allowance for credit losses. 21 Table of Contents NOTE 6 –
LEASES Accounting Policies and Matters Requiring Management's Judgment The Company uses its effective annual interest rate, adjusted for certain assumptions, as the discount rate when evaluating leases under Topic 842. Management applies the adjusted effective annual interest rate to leases entered for the entirety of the subsequent year. Based on its historical practice, the Company believes it is reasonably certain to exercise a given option associated with a given office space lease. Therefore, the Company classifies all lease options for office space as “reasonably certain” unless it has specific knowledge to the contrary for a given lease. The Company generally does not believe it is reasonably certain to exercise any options associated with its office equipment leases. Periodic Disclosures The Company's operating leases consist of real estate leases for office space as well as office equipment. Both the branch real estate and office equipment lease terms generally range from
three years
to
five years , and generally contain options to extend which mirror the original terms of the lease.
The Company's finance leases consist of IT equipment which have a
three year
lease term and do not contain an option to extend the lease term, but do contain an option to purchase the IT equipment at the expiration of the lease term. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the lease terms associated with the Company's finance leases expired and the Company exercised its purchase option to acquire the IT equipment. Because it was reasonably certain that the Company would obtain the assets at the end of their lease terms, the right-of-use assets have amortized over the useful life of the asset, rather than over the lease term. The following table reports information about the Company's lease cost for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Three months ended December 31, Nine months ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Lease Cost Finance lease cost $ —   $ 105,639   $ 205,975   $ 323,880   Amortization of right-of-use assets —   101,906   204,552   305,718   Interest on lease liabilities —   3,733   1,423   18,162   Operating lease cost $ 6,746,965   $ 6,723,789   $ 21,013,997   $ 20,421,780   Variable lease cost $ 920,991   $ 904,015   $ 2,772,620   $ 2,690,848   Total lease cost $ 7,667,956   $ 7,733,443   $ 23,992,592   $ 23,436,508   22 Table of Contents The following table reports other information about the Company's leases for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Three months ended December 31, Nine months ended December 31,   2022 2021 2022 2021 Other Lease Information Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 6,550,184   $ 6,825,474   $ 19,998,398   $ 20,796,373   Operating cash flows from finance leases —   3,733   1,423   18,162   Operating cash flows from operating leases 6,550,184   6,684,414   19,916,908   20,339,163   Financing cash flows from finance leases —   137,327   80,067   439,048   Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities $ —   $ —   $ —   $ —   Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ 3,447,091   $ 2,763,875   $ 13,912,470   $ 11,840,569   Weighted-average remaining lease term — finance leases —   0.5

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Stock Incentive Plans The Company maintains a 2008 Stock Option Plan, a 2011 Stock Option Plan and a 2017 Stock Incentive Plan for the benefit of certain non-employee directors, officers, and key employees. Under these plans, a total of
3,350,000
shares of authorized common stock have been reserved for issuance pursuant to grants approved by the Compensation Committee. Stock options granted under these plans have a maximum term of
10
years, may be subject to certain vesting requirements, which are generally
three
to
six years
for officers, non-employee directors, and key employees, and are priced at the market value of the Company's common stock on the option's grant date. At December 31, 2022, there were a total of
144,629
shares of common stock remaining available for grant under the plans. Stock-based compensation is recognized as provided under FASB ASC Topic 718-10 and FASB ASC Topic 505-50. FASB ASC Topic 718-10 requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period) in the Consolidated Financial Statements based on their grant date fair values. The Company has applied the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the grant date fair value of the stock option awards. Compensation expense is recognized only for those options expected to vest. Long-term Incentive Program and Non-Employee Director Awards On October 15, 2018, the Compensation Committee and Board approved and adopted a long-term incentive program that seeks to motivate and reward certain employees and to align management’s interest with shareholders’ by focusing executives on the achievement of long-term results. The program is comprised of four components: Service Options, Performance Options, Restricted Stock, and Performance Shares. Pursuant to this program, in fiscal 2019, the Compensation Committee approved certain grants of Service Options, Performance Options, Restricted Stock and Performance Shares under the World Acceptance Corporation 2011 Stock Option Plan and the World Acceptance Corporation 2017 Stock Incentive Plan to certain employee directors, vice presidents of operations, vice presidents, senior vice presidents, and executive officers. Separately, the Compensation Committee approved certain grants of Service Options and Restricted Stock to certain of the Company’s non-employee directors. Under the long-term incentive program, up to
100 % of the shares of restricted stock subject to the Performance Shares will vest, if at all, based on the achievement of two trailing earnings per share performance targets established by the Compensation Committee that are based on earnings per share (measured at the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the calendar quarter ending September 30, 2019) for the previous four calendar quarters. The Performance Shares are eligible to vest over the Performance Share Measurement Period and subject to each respective employee’s continued employment at the Company through the last day of the Performance Share Measurement Period (or as otherwise provided under the terms of the applicable award agreement or applicable employment agreement). The Performance Share performance targets are set forth below. Trailing 4-Quarter EPS Targets for September 30, 2018 through March 31, 2025 Restricted Stock Eligible for Vesting (Percentage of Award) $ 16.35 40 % $ 20.45 60 % The Restricted Stock awards vest in
six
equal annual installments, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to each respective employee’s continued employment at the Company through each applicable vesting date or otherwise provided under the terms of the applicable award agreement or applicable employment agreement. The Service Options vest in
six
equal annual installments, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to each respective employee’s continued employment at the Company through each applicable vesting date or otherwise provided under the terms of the applicable award agreement or applicable employment agreement. The option price is equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date and the Service Options have a
10 -year term. The Performance Options will fully vest if the Company attains the trailing earnings per share target over four consecutive calendar quarters occurring between September 30, 2018 and March 31, 2025 described below. Such performance target was established by the Compensation Committee and will be measured at the end of each calendar quarter commencing on
25 Table of Contents September 30, 2019. The Performance Options are eligible to vest over the Option Measurement Period, subject to each respective employee’s continued employment at the Company through the last day of the Option Measurement Period or as otherwise provided under the terms of the applicable award agreement or applicable employment agreement. The option price is equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date and the Performance Options have a
10 -year term.  The Performance Option performance target is set forth below. Trailing 4-Quarter EPS Targets for September 30, 2018 through March 31, 2025 Options Eligible for Vesting (Percentage of Award) $ 25.30 100 % Stock Options The weighted-average fair value at the grant date for options issued during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 44.23
and $ 101.73 , respectively. The weighted-average fair value at the grant date for options issued during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 53.51
and $ 97.65 , respectively. Fair value was estimated at grant date using the weighted-average assumptions listed below: Three months ended December 31, Nine months ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Dividend Yield — % — % — % — % Expected Volatility 57.46 % 55.71 % 57.09 % 58.11 % Average risk-free rate 3.91 % 1.22 % 3.59 % 0.92 % Expected Life 5.8
years 6.0
years 5.8
years 6.1
years The expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock for a period approximating the expected life. The expected life represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding after the grant date. The risk-free rate reflects the interest rate at grant date on zero coupon U.S. governmental bonds having a remaining life similar to the expected option term. Option activity for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was as follows:   Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value Options outstanding, beginning of period 348,743   $ 104.38       Granted during period 15,090   96.15       Exercised during period ( 6,550 ) 84.67       Forfeited during period ( 20,636 ) 119.94       Expired during period ( 12,372 ) 77.78       Options outstanding, end of period 324,275     3 $ 104.42   5.9

million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
2.0
years. Restricted Stock During the nine months of fiscal 2023, the Company granted
2,750
shares of restricted stock (which are equity classified) to certain vice presidents, senior vice presidents, executive officers, and non-employee directors with a grant date weighted average fair value of $ 138.76  per share. During fiscal 2022, the Company granted
4,062
shares of restricted stock (which are equity classified) to certain vice presidents with a grant date weighted average fair value of $ 188.38
per share. Compensation expense related to restricted stock is based on the number of shares expected to vest and the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. The Company recognized compensation benefit of $ 0.7
million and compensation expense of $ 3.6
million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which is included as a component of general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company recognized compensation expense of $ 5.5

ACQUISITIONS The Company evaluates each set of assets and activities it acquires to determine if the set meets the definition of a business according to FASB ASC Topic 805-10-55. Acquisitions meeting the definition of a business are accounted for as a business combination while all other acquisitions are accounted for as asset purchases.
The following table sets forth the Company's acquisition activity for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.   Nine months ended December 31, 2022 2021 Acquisitions: Number of loan portfolios acquired through asset purchases 43   50   Total acquisitions 43   50   Purchase price $ 22,314,902   $ 10,859,984   Tangible assets:   Loans receivable, net 27,105,078   9,631,112   Purchase price amount over (below) carrying value of net tangible assets 5 $ ( 4,790,176 ) $ 1,228,872   Customer lists $ —   $ 952,872   Non-compete agreements $ —   $ 276,000   Acquisitions that are accounted for as business combinations typically result in one or more new branches. In such cases, the Company typically retains the existing employees and the branch location from the acquisition. The purchase price is allocated to the tangible assets and intangible assets acquired based upon their estimated fair market values at the acquisition date. The remainder is allocated to goodwill. Acquisitions that are accounted for as asset purchases are typically limited to acquisitions of loan portfolios. The purchase price is allocated to the tangible assets and intangible assets acquired based upon their estimated fair market values at the acquisition date. In an asset purchase, no goodwill is recorded. The Company’s acquisitions include tangible assets (generally loans and furniture and equipment) and intangible assets (generally non-compete agreements, customer lists, and goodwill), both of which are recorded at their fair values, which are estimated pursuant to the processes described below. 4
The $( 679,443 ) for the three months ended December 31, 2022 represents $ 2.8  million in forfeiture credit, offset by $ 2.1  million in current period expense. 5
As a result of the asset purchases during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded a $ 4.8  million gain, net of $ 1.1  million income tax, which is included as a component of Insurance and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The transactions resulted in a gain as the acquired loan portfolios were purchased at a discount. As an immediate gain would be recognized on the net loans acquired if the cost below fair value was allocated, it was not determined appropriate to reduce the basis of the net loans acquired. 28 Table of Contents Acquired loans are valued at the net loan balance. Given the short-term nature of these loans, generally
8
months, and that these loans are priced at current rates, management believes the net loan balances approximate their fair value. Under CECL, acquired loans are included in the reserve calculations for all other loan types (excluding TALs). Management includes recent acquisition activity compared to historical activity when considering reasonable and supportable forecasts as it relates to assessing the adequacy of the allowance for expected credit losses. The Company did not acquire any loans that would qualify as PCDs during the period. Furniture and equipment are valued at the specific purchase price as agreed to by both parties at the time of acquisition, which management believes approximates their fair values. Non-compete agreements are valued at the stated amount paid to the other party for these agreements, which the Company believes approximates their fair value.
Customer lists are valued with a valuation model that utilizes the Company’s historical data to estimate the value of any acquired customer lists. Customer lists are allocated at a branch level and are evaluated for impairment at a branch level when a triggering event occurs in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360-10-05. If a triggering event occurs, the impairment loss to the customer list is generally the remaining unamortized customer list balance. In most acquisitions, the original fair value of the customer list allocated to a branch is less than $100,000, and management believes that in the event a triggering event were to occur, the impairment loss to an unamortized customer list would be immaterial. The estimated results of all acquisitions have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements since the respective acquisition date. The pro forma impact of these branches as though they had been acquired at the beginning of the periods presented would not have a material effect on the results of operations as reported. NOTE 10 –
DEBT Senior Notes Payable; Revolving Credit Facility At December 31, 2022, the Company had a $ 685.0
million senior revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility was amended in connection with the Company’s Notes offering (described below) on September 27, 2021 to permit the issuance of the Notes described below and increase the amount of permitted borrowings under the accordion feature from $ 685.0  million to $ 785.0
million. On November 23, 2022, the revolving credit agreement was amended (the "Ninth Amendment") to, among other things, (1) change the required ratio for net income available for fixed charges to fixed charges to
1.25
to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022,
1.15
to 1.0 for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023,

28 % for the calendar months ending October 31, 2022 through June 30, 2023 and
26 % thereafter; and (4) decrease the advance rate to as low as
62 % from
74 % for the calendar months ending October 31, 2022 through June 30, 2023. At December 31, 2022, $ 426.5
million was outstanding under the Company's credit facility, not including a $ 300.0
thousand outstanding standby letter of credit related to workers compensation under a $ 1.5  million sub-facility. To the extent that the letter of credit is drawn upon, the disbursement will be funded by the credit facility. There are no amounts due related to the letter of credit as of December 31, 2022. The letter of credit expired on December 31, 2021; however, it automatically extends for
one year
on the expiration date. Subject to a borrowing base formula, the Company may borrow at the rate of one month SOFR plus
.10 % and an applicable margin of
3.5 % with a minimum rate of
4.5 %. The revolving credit facility has a commitment fee of
0.50 % per annum on the unused portion of the commitment. Commitment fees on the unused portion of the borrowing totaled $ 0.9
million and $ 1.0
million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 29 Table of Contents For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, the Company’s effective interest rate, including the commitment fee and amortization of debt issuance costs, was
6.8 % annualized and
5.5 %, respectively, and the unused amount available under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2022 was $ 258.2
million. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility mature on June 7, 2024. Substantially all of the Company’s assets are pledged as collateral for borrowings under the revolving credit agreement. Senior Unsecured Notes Payable On September 27, 2021, we issued $ 300.0
million in aggregate principal amount of
7.0 % senior notes due 2026 (the “Notes”). The Notes were sold in a private placement in reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by all of the Company’s existing and certain of its future subsidiaries that guarantee the revolving credit facility. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing May 1, 2022. At any time prior to November 1, 2023, the Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to
100 % of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium, as described in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. At any time on or after November 1, 2023, the Company may redeem the Notes at redemption prices set forth in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. In addition, at any time prior to November 1, 2023, the Company may use the proceeds of certain equity offerings to redeem up to
40.0 % of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the indenture at a redemption price equal to
107.0 % of the principal amount of Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. We used the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Debt Covenants The agreement governing the Company’s revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that generally restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or guarantee indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends and repurchase or redeem capital stock, dispose of assets, engage in mergers and consolidations, make acquisitions or other investments, redeem or prepay subordinated debt, amend subordinated debt documents, make changes in the nature of its business, and engage in transactions with affiliates. The agreement allows the Company to incur subordinated debt that matures after the termination date for the revolving credit facility and that contains specified subordination terms, subject to limitations on amount imposed by the financial covenants under the agreement. The agreement also contains financial covenants, including (i) a minimum consolidated net worth of $ 325.0
million on and after December 31, 2020; (ii) a maximum ratio of total debt to consolidated adjusted net worth as further discussed below; (iii) a maximum collateral performance indicator as further discussed below; and (iv) a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio as further discussed below.
As discussed above, on November 23, 2022, the Company entered into the Ninth Amendment to, among other things, (1) change the required ratio for net income available for fixed charges to fixed charges to
1.25
to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022,
1.15
to 1.0 for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023,
1.50
to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter September 30, 2023,
2.0
to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023, and
2.75
to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter thereafter, where the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters must be at least
2.0
to 1.0 in order for the Company to declare dividends or purchase any class or series of its capital stock or other equity; (2) change the ratio of total debt to consolidated adjusted net worth to
2.5
to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022,
2.25
to 1.0 for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023,
2.0
to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2023,
2.25
to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023, and
2.5
to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter thereafter; (3) require a collateral performance indicator of less than or equal to
28 % for the calendar months ending October 31, 2022 through June 30, 2023 and
26 % thereafter; and (4) decrease the advance rate to as low as
62 % from
74 % for the calendar months ending October 31, 2022 through June 30, 2023.
The collateral performance indicator is equal to the sum of (a) a three-month rolling average rate of receivables at least sixty days past due and (b) an eight-month rolling average net charge-off rate.
The Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2022 and does not believe that these covenants will materially limit its business and expansion strategy. The revolving credit agreement contains events of default including, without limitation, nonpayment of principal, interest or other obligations, violation of covenants, misrepresentation, cross-default and cross-acceleration to other debt, bankruptcy and
30 Table of Contents other insolvency events, judgments, certain ERISA events, actual or asserted invalidity of loan documentation, invalidity of subordination provisions of subordinated debt, certain changes of control of the Company, and the occurrence of certain regulatory events (including the entry of any stay, order, judgment, ruling or similar event related to the Company’s or any of its subsidiaries’ originating, holding, pledging, collecting or enforcing its eligible finance receivables that is material to the Company or any subsidiary) which remains unvacated, undischarged, unbonded or unstayed by appeal or otherwise for a period of
60
days from the date of its entry and is reasonably likely to cause a material adverse change. If it is determined that a violation of any applicable law has occurred, such violation may give rise to an event of default under our credit agreement if such violation were to result in a material adverse change on our business, operations, results of operations, assets, liabilities, or condition (financial or otherwise), or a material impairment of the Company’s and the subsidiaries’ ability to perform their obligations under the agreement or related documents, or if the amount of any settlement, penalties, fines, or other payments resulted in the Company failing to satisfy any financial covenants. The indenture governing the Notes contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company’s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to (i) incur additional indebtedness or issue certain disqualified stock and preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends or distributions or redeem or purchase capital stock; (iii) prepay subordinated debt or make certain investments; (iv) transfer and sell assets; (v) create or permit to exist liens; (vi) enter into agreements that restrict dividends, loans and other distributions from their subsidiaries; (vii) engage in a merger, consolidation or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets; and (viii) engage in transactions with affiliates. However, these covenants are subject to a number of important detailed qualifications and exceptions. Debt Maturities The aggregate annual maturities of the Company's debt arrangements as of December 31, 2022 are as follows: Remainder of 2023 $ —   2024 —   2025 426,490,205   2026 —   2027 300,000,000   Total future debt payments $ 726,490,205   NOTE 11 –
INCOME TAXES As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company had $ 1.1
million and $ 2.2
million, respectively, of total gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest. Approximately $ 0.8
million and $ 2.0
million, respectively, represent the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that are permanent in nature and, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate. At December 31, 2022, approximately $ 0.5
million of gross unrecognized tax benefits are expected to be resolved during the next twelve months through the expiration of the statute of limitations and settlement with taxing authorities. The Company’s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $ 271.5
thousand accrued for gross interest and reversed $ 284.0
thousand during the nine months ended December 31, 2022.   The Company is subject to U.S. income taxes, as well as taxes in various other state and local jurisdictions. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2018, although carryforward attributes that were generated prior to 2018 may still be adjusted upon examination by the taxing authorities if they either have been or will be used in a future period. The Company’s effective income tax rate totaled
9.7 % for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 compared to
5.1 % for the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due to the permanent benefit related to non-qualified stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock as discrete items in the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by the effects of pretax book earnings relative to the effects of various permanent items including a decrease in the disallowed executive compensation under Section 162(m) and the recognition of additional Federal Historic Tax Credits when compared to the prior year quarter.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Derivative Litigation 31 Table of Contents On September 25, 2020, a shareholder filed a derivative complaint in South Carolina state court,
Paul Parshall v. World Acceptance et al ., against the Company as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants. Pointing to the Company’s resolution with the SEC and DOJ of the Mexico investigation previously disclosed, the complaint alleges violations of South Carolina law, including breaches of fiduciary duties and corporate waste, and that the Company has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages from the individual defendants, equitable and/or injunctive relief, disgorgement of compensation from the individual defendants, and attorneys’ fees and costs. Because the complaint is derivative in nature, it does not seek monetary damages from the Company. However, the Company may be required to advance, and ultimately be responsible for, the legal fees and costs incurred by the individual defendants.
General In addition, from time to time the Company is involved in litigation matters relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. Estimating an amount or range of possible losses resulting from litigation, government actions and other legal proceedings is inherently difficult and requires an extensive degree of judgment, particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages, may involve fines, penalties or damages that are discretionary in amount, involve a large number of claimants or significant discretion by regulatory authorities, represent a change in regulatory policy or interpretation, present novel legal theories, are in the early stages of the proceedings, are subject to appeal or could result in a change in business practices. In addition, because most legal proceedings are resolved over extended periods of time, potential losses are subject to change due to, among other things, new developments, changes in legal strategy, the outcome of intermediate procedural and substantive rulings and other parties’ settlement posture and their evaluation of the strength or weakness of their case against us. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period.

Average gross loans receivable has been determined by averaging month-end gross loans receivable over the indicated period, excluding tax advances. (2)
Net loans receivable is defined as gross loans receivable less unearned interest and deferred fees. (3)
Average net loans receivable has been determined by averaging month-end gross loans receivable less unearned interest and deferred fees over the indicated period, excluding tax advances. (4)
Operating income is computed as total revenue less provision for credit losses and general and administrative expenses. (5)
Loan volume includes all loan balances originated by the Company. It does not include loans purchased through acquisitions. Comparison of three months ended December 31, 2022 versus three months ended December 31, 2021
Gross loans outstanding increased to $1.55 billion as of December 31, 2022, a 3.2% decrease from the $1.61 billion of gross loans outstanding as of December 31, 2021.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022 our unique borrowers decreased by 4.9% compared to an increase of 7.7% during the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased to net income of $5.8 million, a 21.4% decrease from a net income of $7.3 million for the same period of the prior year. Operating income, which is revenue less provision for credit losses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $2.6 million, or 14.3%, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $2.1 million, or 1.4%, to $146.5 million from $148.6 million for the same period of the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a 4.8% decrease in average gross earning loans (total gross loans less gross loans 60 days or more contractually past due and tax advances).
34 Table of Contents Interest and fee income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $1.9 million, or 1.5%, from the same period of the prior year due to a decrease in loans outstanding. The decrease was primarily due to a 4.8% decrease in average gross earning loans (total gross loans less gross loans 60 days or more contractually past due and tax advances).
Insurance and other income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $0.1 million, or 0.6%, from the same period of the prior year. Insurance income increased by approximately $2.8 million, or 19.5%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Insurance income increased due to a shift to larger loans over the twelve months ending December 31, 2022. The sale of insurance products are limited to large loans in several of our states. The large loan portfolio increased from 49.5% of the overall portfolio as of December 31, 2021 to 56.4% as of December 31, 2022. Other income decreased by $2.9 million. Other income decreased due to a decrease in sales of our motor club product as a result of lower originations during the quarter.
The provision for credit losses increased $3.1 million, or 5.6%, to $59.6 million from $56.5 million when comparing the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The table below itemizes the key components of the CECL allowance and provision impact during the quarter.
CECL Allowance and Provision (Dollars in millions) FY 2023 FY 2022 Difference Reconciliation Beginning Allowance - September 30 $155.9 $114.7 $41.2 Change due to Growth $(4.3) $17.4 $(21.7) $(21.7) Change due to Expected Loss Rate on Performing Loans $(7.5) $(10.9) $3.4 $3.4 Change due to 90 day past due $0.4 $12.2 $(11.8) $(11.8) Ending Allowance - December 31 $144.5 $133.4 $11.1 $(30.1) Net Charge-offs $71.0 $37.8 $33.2 $33.2 Provision $59.6 $56.5 $3.1 $3.1 Note: The change in allowance for the quarter plus net charge-offs for the quarter equals the provision for the quarter (see above reconciliation). The provision benefited from a decrease in the portfolio and changes in expected loss rates on our performing loans. The three most important factors impacting the expected loss rates on performing loans are recent actual loss performance, changes in Customer Tenure mix, and a seasonality factor. The table below includes the seasonality factor for each quarter end.
Quarter End Seasonality Factor March 31 0.943738 June 30 1.080301 September 30 1.047518 December 31 0.938281 Expected loss rates by Customer Tenure bucket also increased due to actual loss rates increasing as credit normalizes. Actual loss rates increased at substantially lower rates in the third quarter compared to the first and second quarter. This was offset by a decreasing seasonality factor and by a shift in portfolio mix to more tenured customers.
Net charge-offs for the quarter increased 33.2 million, from $37.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 to $71.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average net loan receivables on an annualized basis increased from 13.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 to 25.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Net charge-offs during the period include $11.4 million in proceeds related to the sale of charge-offs, for which $8.4 million relates to bulk sales of charge-offs from prior periods and $3 million relates to recurring sales of charge-offs during the three months ended December 31, 2022. The Company's allowance for credit losses as a percentage of net loans was 12.9% at December 31, 2022 compared to 11.4% at December 31, 2021. Accounts that were 61 days or more past due on a recency basis were 7.4% of the portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 6.4% of the portfolio at December 31, 2021. Accounts that were 61 days or more past due on a contractual basis were 9.3% of the portfolio at December 31, 2022 compared to 7.8% of the portfolio at December 31, 2021. G&A expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $7.8 million, or 10.5%, from the corresponding period of the previous year. As a percentage of revenues, G&A expenses decreased from 50.0% during the three months ended December 31, 2021 to 45.4% during the three months ended December 31, 2022. G&A expenses per average open branch
35 Table of Contents decreased by 1.6% when comparing the two three-month periods. The change in G&A expense is explained in greater detail below. Personnel
expense totaled $40.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, a $3.7 million, or 8.3%, decrease over the three months ended December 31, 2021. Benefit expense decreased approximately $0.1 million, or 1.7%, when comparing the quarterly periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Incentive expense decreased $6.9 million, or 62.8%. This was offset by a $2.2 million, or 7.5%, increase in salary expense when comparing the two quarterly periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The decrease in incentives expense is
mostly due to a $3.1 million decrease in share based compensation related to forfeiture of shares during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Additionally, o n July 1, 2022, we increased base wages for our Financial Service Representatives to a minimum of approximately $15 an hour and eliminated the monthly bonus for the same position. The increase in salary expense is mostly due to the increased based wages for our Financial Service Representatives as mentioned above and our headcount as of December 31, 2022, increased 0.8% compared to December 30, 2021.
Occupancy and equipment
expense totaled $12.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, a $0.3 million, or 2.5%, increase over the three months ended December 31, 2021. Occupancy and equipment expense is generally a function of the number of branches the Company has open throughout the period. The current year includes $0.4 million in expense related to the merger of branches during the quarter. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the average open branches decreased 9.1% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Advertising
expense decreased $5.5 million, or 80.7%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022 due to decreased spending on new customer acquisition programs. Amortization of intangible assets
totaled $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, a $161.2 thousand, or 12.6%, decrease over the three months ended December 31, 2021. Other
expense totaled $10.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, a $1.3 million, or 13.8%, increase over the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $3.9 million, or 38.4%, from the corresponding three months of the previous year. The increase in interest expense was due to a 14.6% increase in the average debt outstanding, from $640.8 million to $734.3 million, and a 21.4% increase in the effective interest rate from 6.3% to 7.6%. The Company’s senior debt-to-equity ratio increased from 1.8:1 at December 31, 2021 to 2.0:1 at December 31, 2022. Other key return ratios for the three months ended December 31, 2022 included a 1.1% return on average assets and a return on average equity of 3.8%
(both on a trailing 12-month basis), as compared to a 7.4% return on average assets and a return on average equity of 20.1% (both on a trailing 12-month basis) for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The Company’s effective income tax rate increased to 9.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 5.1% for the corresponding period of the previous year. The increase is primarily due to the permanent benefit related to non-qualified stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock as discrete items in the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by the effects of pretax book earnings relative to the effects of various permanent items including a decrease in the disallowed executive compensation under Section 162(m) and the recognition of additional Federal Historic Tax Credits when compared to the prior year quarter. Comparison of nine months ended December 31, 2022 versus nine months ended December 31, 2021
Gross loans outstanding increased to $1.55 billion as of December 31, 2022, a 3.2% decrease from the $1.61 billion of gross loans outstanding as of December 31, 2021. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 our number of unique borrowers in the portfolio decreased by 13.7% compared to an increase of 4.4% during the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Net income (loss) for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 decreased to a net loss of $4.4 million, a 112.4% decrease from a net income of $35.5 million reported for the same period of the prior year. Operating income (revenue less provision for credit losses and general and administrative expenses) decreased by $33.9 million, or 52.4%. Revenues increased by $39.3 million, or 9.4%, to $455.3 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 from $416.1 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in average net loans outstanding.
36 Table of Contents Interest and fee income for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $31.4 million, or 8.8%, from the same period of the prior year. Interest and fee income was impacted by a shift to larger, lower interest rate loans. Average net loans outstanding increased by 18.8% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine-month period ended December 31, 2021. Insurance and other income for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $7.8 million, or 12.9%, from the same period of the prior year. Insurance income increased by approximately $10.5 million, or 25.7%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Insurance income benefited from the shift to larger loans mentioned above. Other income decreased by $2.6 million due to a decreases in the sale of our motor club product and tax preparation business revenue, offset by a $3.7 million bargain purchase gain during the
nine months ended December 31, 2022. G&A expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $12.1 million, or 5.4%, from the corresponding period of the previous year. As a percentage of revenues, G&A expenses decreased from 53.5% during the first nine months of fiscal 2022 to 46.2% during the first nine months of fiscal 2023. G&A expenses per average open branch increased by 1.1% when comparing the two nine-month periods. The change in G&A expense is explained in greater detail below. Personnel
expense totaled $131.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, a $5.2 million, or 3.8%, decrease over the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Salary expense increased approximately $7.1 million, or 8.2%, when comparing the two nine month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Our headcount as of December 31, 2022, increased 0.8% compared to December 31, 2021. Benefit expense decreased approximately $1.2 million, or 4.7%, when comparing the nine month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Incentive expense decreased $12.6 million, or 36.8% mostly due to
a decrease in share based compensation related to forfeiture of shares and
a reduction in branch level bonuses. Occupancy and equipment
expense totaled $39.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, a $0.5 million, or 1.3%, increase over the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Occupancy and equipment expense is generally a function of the number of branches the Company has open throughout the period. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the average occupancy and equipment expense per branch increased to $35.2 thousand, up from $32.5 thousand for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The prior year includes $0.4 million more in write down of signage as a result of rebranding our offices when comparing the two nine-month periods. The current year includes $1.5 million in expense related to the merger of branches during the nine months ended December 31, 2022. Advertising
expense totaled $4.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, a $11.4 million, or 71.4%, decrease over the nine months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is due to decreased spending on new customer acquisition programs during the period. Amortization of intangible assets
totaled $3.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, a $383.4 thousand, or 10.3%, decrease over the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Other
expense totaled $31.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, a $4.3 million, or 15.8%, increase over the nine months ended December 31, 2021.
Interest expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 increased by $15.9 million, or 71.0%, from the corresponding nine months of the previous year. The increase in interest expense was due to a 41.0% increase in the average debt outstanding, from $530.0 million to $747.4 million, offset by a 23.1% increase in the effective interest rate from 5.5% to 6.8%.
Other key return ratios for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 included a 1.1% return on average assets and a return on average equity of 3.8%
(both on a trailing 12-month basis), as compared to a 7.4% return on average assets and a return on average equity of 20.1% (both on a trailing 12-month basis) for the first nine months of fiscal 2022.
The Company’s effective income tax rate increased to 41.1% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 16.1% for the corresponding period of the previous year. The increase is primarily due to the permanent benefit related to non-qualified stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock as discrete items in the prior year. This was partially offset by the effects of pretax book earnings relative to the effects of various permanent items including a decrease in the disallowed executive compensation under Section 162(m) and the recognition of additional Federal Historic Tax Credits when compared to the prior year. 37 Table of Contents Regulatory Matters CFPB Rulemaking Initiatives On October 5, 2017, the CFPB issued a final rule (the "Rule") imposing limitations on (i) short-term consumer loans, (ii) longer-term consumer installment loans with balloon payments, and (iii) higher-rate consumer installment loans repayable by a payment authorization. The Rule originally required lenders originating short-term loans and longer-term balloon payment loans to evaluate whether each consumer has the ability to repay the loan along with current obligations and expenses (“ability to repay requirements”), however the ability to repay requirements were rescinded in July 2020. The Rule also curtails repeated unsuccessful attempts to debit consumers’ accounts for short-term loans, balloon payment loans, and installment loans that involve a payment authorization and an annual percentage rate over 36% (“payment requirements”). However, on October 19, 2022, a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held in
Cmty. Fin.l Servs. Ass’n of Am., Ltd. v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau , that the CFPB’s funding structure violated the U.S. Constitution’s Appropriations Clause, which requires that all expenditures of federal funds be approved by Congress. On this ground, it vacated the Rule. The decision will be binding in the Fifth Circuit’s jurisdiction, covering Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi, and persuasive in other circuits until there’s a competing case to contradict it. The CFPB has filed a certiorari petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to
review
the Fifth Circuit’s panel decision and hear arguments in April 2023. Implementation of the Rule’s payment requirements is uncertain, but if it were to take effect it could require changes to the Company’s practices and procedures for such loans, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability to make such loans, the cost of making such loans, the Company’s ability to, or frequency with which it could, refinance any such loans, and the profitability of such loans. Unless rescinded or otherwise amended, the Company will have to comply with the Rule’s payment requirements if it continues to allow consumers to set up future recurring payments online for certain covered loans such that it meets the definition of having a “leveraged payment mechanism” under the Rule. If the payment provisions of the Rule apply, the Company will have to modify its loan payment procedures to comply with the required notices and mandated timeframes set forth in the final rule. In its Fall 2015 rulemaking agenda, the CFPB stated that it expected to conduct a rulemaking to identify larger participants in the installment lending market for purposes of its supervision program. However, this initiative was classified as “inactive” on the CFPB’s Spring 2018 rulemaking, and its Fall 2022 rulemaking agenda showed no planned activity in this area. Though the likelihood and timing of any such rulemaking is uncertain, the Company believes that the implementation of such rules would likely bring the Company’s business under the CFPB’s supervisory authority which, among other things, would subject the Company to reporting obligations to, and on-site compliance examinations by, the CFPB. See Part I, Item 1, “Business - Government Regulation - Federal legislation,” for a further discussion of these matters and the federal regulations to which the Company’s operations are subject and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2021 for more information regarding these regulatory and related risks. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company has historically financed and continues to finance its operations, acquisitions and branch expansion primarily through a combination of cash flows from operations and borrowings from its institutional lenders. As discussed below, the Company has also issued debt securities to finance its operations and repay a portion of its outstanding indebtedness. The Company has generally applied its cash flows from operations to fund its loan volume, fund acquisitions, repay long-term indebtedness, and repurchase its common stock. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $205.9 million. The Company believes that attractive opportunities to acquire new branches or receivables from its competitors or to acquire branches in communities not currently served by the Company will continue to become available as conditions in local economies and the financial circumstances of owners change. On September 27, 2021, we issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.0% senior notes due 2026 (the “Notes”). The Notes were sold in a private placement in reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by all of the Company’s existing and certain of its future subsidiaries that guarantee the revolving credit facility. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing May 1, 2022. At any time prior to November 1, 2023, the Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium, as described in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. At any time on or after November 1, 2023, the Company may redeem the Notes at redemption prices set forth in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. In addition, at any time
38 Table of Contents prior to November 1, 2023, the Company may use the proceeds of certain equity offerings to redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the indenture at a redemption price equal to 107.0% of the principal amount of Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. We used the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The indenture governing the Notes contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company’s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to (i) incur additional indebtedness or issue certain disqualified stock and preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends or distributions or redeem or purchase capital stock; (iii) prepay subordinated debt or make certain investments; (iv) transfer and sell assets; (v) create or permit to exist liens; (vi) enter into agreements that restrict dividends, loans and other distributions from their subsidiaries; (vii) engage in a merger, consolidation or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets; and (viii) engage in transactions with affiliates. However, these covenants are subject to a number of important detailed qualifications and exceptions. The Company continues to believe stock repurchases are a viable component of the Company’s long-term financial strategy and an excellent use of excess cash when the opportunity arises. However, our revolving credit facility and the Notes limit share repurchases to up to 50% of consolidated adjusted net income for the period commencing January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2022, subject to further approval from our Board of Directors, we could repurchase approximately $16.4 million of shares under the terms of our debt facilities.
A dditional share repurchases can be made subject to compliance with, among other things, applicable restricted payment covenants under the revolving credit facility and the Notes. The Company has a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. The revolving credit facility provides for revolving borrowings of up to the lesser of (a) the aggregate commitments under the facility and (b) a borrowing base, and it includes a $300.0 thousand letter of credit under a $1.5 million subfacility. Subject to a borrowing base formula, the Company may borrow at the rate of one month SOFR plus .10% and an applicable margin of 3.5% with a minimum rate of 4.5%. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility were $685.0 million. The $300.0 thousand letter of credit outstanding under the subfacility expired on December 31, 2021; however, it automatically extends for one year on the expiration date. The borrowing base limitation is equal to the product of (a) the Company’s eligible finance receivables, less unearned finance charges, insurance premiums and insurance commissions applicable to such eligible finance receivables, and (b) an advance rate percentage that ranges from 62% to 80% based on a collateral performance indicator, as more completely described below. Further, under the amended and restated revolving credit agreement, the administrative agent has the right to set aside reasonable reserves against the available borrowing base in such amounts as it may deem appropriate, including, without limitation, reserves with respect to certain regulatory events or any increased operational, legal, or regulatory risk of the Company and its subsidiaries. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, the Company’s effective interest rate, including the commitment fee and amortization of debt issuance costs, was 6.8% annualized and 5.5%, respectively, and the unused amount available under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2022 was $258.2 million. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility mature on June 7, 2024. The Company’s obligations under the revolving credit facility, together with treasury management and hedging obligations owing to any lender under the revolving credit facility or any affiliate of any such lender, are required to be guaranteed by each of the Company’s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. The obligations of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors under the revolving credit facility, together with such treasury management and hedging obligations, are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors. The agreement governing the Company’s revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or guarantee indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends and repurchase or redeem capital stock, dispose of assets, engage in mergers and consolidations, make acquisitions or other investments, redeem or prepay subordinated debt, amend subordinated debt documents, make changes in the nature of its business, and engage in transactions with affiliates. The agreement allows the Company to incur subordinated debt that matures after the termination date for the revolving credit facility and that contains specified subordination terms, subject to limitations on the amount incurred that are imposed by the financial covenants under the agreement. The agreement also contains financial covenants, including (i) a minimum consolidated net worth of $325.0 million on and after December 31, 2020; (ii) a maximum ratio of total debt to consolidated adjusted net worth as further discussed below; (iii) a maximum collateral performance indicator as further discussed below; and (iv) a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio as further discussed below.
39 Table of Contents As further discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on November 23, 2022, the Company entered into the Ninth Amendment to, among other things, (1) change the required ratio for net income available for fixed charges to fixed charges to 1.25 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022, 1.15 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, 1.50 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter September 30, 2023, 2.0 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023, and 2.75 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter thereafter, where the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters must be at least 2.0 to 1.0 in order for the Company to declare dividends or purchase any class or series of its capital stock or other equity; (2) change the ratio of total debt to consolidated adjusted net worth to 2.5 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022, 2.25 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, 2.0 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2023, 2.25 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023, and 2.5 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter thereafter; (3) require a collateral performance indicator of less than or equal to 28% for the calendar months ending October 31, 2022 through June 30, 2023 and 26% thereafter; and (4) decrease the advance rate to as low as 62% from 74% for the calendar months ending October 31, 2022 through June 30, 2023.
The collateral performance indicator is equal to the sum of (a) a three-month rolling average rate of receivables at least sixty days past due and (b) an eight-month rolling average net charge-off rate. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2022 and does not believe that these covenants will materially limit its business and expansion strategy. The agreement contains events of default including, without limitation, nonpayment of principal, interest or other obligations, violation of covenants, misrepresentation, cross-default and cross-acceleration to other debt, bankruptcy and other insolvency events, judgments, certain ERISA events, actual or asserted invalidity of loan documentation, invalidity of subordination provisions of subordinated debt, certain changes of control of the Company, and the occurrence of certain regulatory events (including the entry of any stay, order, judgment, ruling or similar event related to the Company’s or any of its subsidiaries’ originating, holding, pledging, collecting or enforcing its eligible finance receivables that is material to the Company or any subsidiary) which remains unvacated, undischarged, unbonded or unstayed by appeal or otherwise for a period of 60 days from the date of its entry and is reasonably likely to cause a material adverse change.
The Company believes that cash flow from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facility or other sources will be adequate to fund the expected cost of opening or acquiring new branches, including funding initial operating losses of new branches and funding loans receivable originated by those branches and the Company's other branches (for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future beyond that). Except as otherwise discussed in this report including, but not limited to, any discussions in Part 1, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K (as supplemented by any subsequent disclosures in information the Company files with or furnishes to the SEC from time to time), management is not currently aware of any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that it believes will or could result in, or are or could be reasonably likely to result in, any material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity.
Share Repurchase Program On February 24, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $30.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, inclusive of the amount that remained available for repurchase under prior repurchase authorizations. As of December 31, 2022 the Company had $1.1 million in aggregate remaining repurchase capacity under its current share repurchase program. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, available funds, alternative uses of capital, restrictions under the revolving credit agreement, and other market and economic conditions. The Company’s stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company continues to believe stock repurchases are a viable component of the Company’s long-term financial strategy and an excellent use of excess cash when the opportunity arises. Additional share repurchases can be made subject to compliance with, among other things, applicable restricted payment covenants under the revolving credit facility and the Notes. Our first priority is to ensure we have enough capital to fund loan growth. As of December 31, 2022, subject to further approval from our Board of Directors, we could repurchase approximately $16.4 million of shares under the terms of our debt facilities.
To the extent we have excess capital, we may repurchase stock, if appropriate and as authorized by our Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's debt outstanding was $722.5 million, net of $3.9 million unamortized debt issuance costs related to the unsecured senior notes payable, and its shareholders' equity was $359.6 million resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.0:1.0. Management will continue to monitor the Company's debt-to-equity ratio and is committed to maintaining a debt level that will allow the Company to continue to execute its business objectives, while not putting undue stress on its consolidated balance sheet.   Inflation 40 Table of Contents The Company does not believe that inflation, within reasonably anticipated rates, will have a material, adverse effect on its financial condition. Although inflation would increase the Company’s operating costs in absolute terms, the Company expects that the same decrease in the value of money would result in an increase in the size of loans demanded by its customer base. It is reasonable to anticipate that such a change in customer preference would result in an increase in total loans receivable and an increase in absolute revenue to be generated from that larger amount of loans receivable. The Company believes that this increase in absolute revenue should offset any increase in operating costs. In addition, because the Company’s loans have a relatively short contractual term and average life, it is unlikely that loans made at any given point in time will be repaid with significantly inflated dollars. Quarterly Information and Seasonality See Note 3 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements   See Note 3 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies   The Company’s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the finance company industry. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgment by the Company’s management, including the use of estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. As a result, changes in these estimates and assumptions could significantly affect the Company’s financial position and results of operations. The Company considers its policies regarding the allowance for credit losses, share-based compensation and income taxes to be its most critical accounting policies due to the significant degree of management judgment involved. Allowance for Credit Losses Accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgement and estimation by management. In the case of loans, the allowance for credit losses is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326 that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. The amount of the allowance account represents management’s best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.   Share-Based Compensation The Company measures compensation cost for share-based awards at fair value and recognizes compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock at the time of grant, and the fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected life, changes to which can materially affect the fair value estimate. Actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from the Company’s current estimates. Income Taxes   Management uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining income taxes payable or refundable, deferred income tax liabilities and assets for events recognized differently in its financial statements and income tax returns, and income tax expense. Determining these amounts requires analysis of certain transactions and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting income tax liabilities and assets. These judgments and estimates are re-evaluated on a periodic basis as regulatory and business factors change. No assurance can be given that either the tax returns submitted by management or the income tax reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements will not be adjusted by either adverse rulings, changes in the tax code, or assessments made by the IRS, state, or foreign taxing authorities. The Company is subject to potential adverse adjustments, including but not limited to: an increase in the statutory federal or state income tax rates, the permanent non-deductibility of amounts currently considered
41 Table of Contents deductible either now or in future periods, and the dependency on the generation of future taxable income in order to ultimately realize deferred income tax assets.   Under FASB ASC Topic 740, the Company will include the current and deferred tax impact of its tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not (likelihood of greater than 50%) that such positions will be sustained by taxing authorities, with full knowledge of relevant information, based on the technical merits of the tax position. While the Company supports its tax positions by unambiguous tax law, prior experience with the taxing authority, and analysis of what it considers to be all relevant facts, circumstances and regulations, management must still rely on assumptions and estimates to determine the overall likelihood of success and proper quantification of a given tax position. 42 Table of Contents Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk The Company’s outstanding debt under its revolving credit facility was $426.5 million at December 31, 2022. Interest on borrowing under this facility is based on the greater of 4.5% or one month SOFR plus .10% and an applicable margin of
3.5%. Based on the outstanding balance at December 31, 2022, a change of 1.0% in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately $4.3 million on an annual basis. Item 4.
Controls and Procedures Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on management’s evaluation, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 43 Table of Contents PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds The Company's credit agreements contain certain limits on share repurchases. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources." On February 24, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $30.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, inclusive of the amount that remained available for repurchase under prior repurchase authorizations. As of December 31, 2022 the Company had $1.1 million in aggregate remaining repurchase capacity under its current share repurchase program. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, available funds, alternative uses of capital, restrictions under the revolving credit agreement, and other market and economic conditions. The Company’s stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The repurchase authorization does not have a stated expiration date.
