Background Houlihan Lokey, Inc. ("Houlihan Lokey" or "HL, Inc.," also referred to as the "Company," "we," "our," or "us") is a Delaware corporation that controls the following primary subsidiaries: • Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc., a California corporation ("HL Capital, Inc."), is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of HL, Inc. HL Capital, Inc. is registered as a broker-dealer under Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. • Houlihan Lokey Financial Advisors, Inc., a California corporation ("HL FA, Inc."), is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of HL, Inc.
• Houlihan Lokey EMEA, LLP, a limited liability partnership registered in England ("HL EMEA, LLP"), is an indirect subsidiary of HL, Inc. HL EMEA, LLP is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom ("U.K."). The Company offers financial services and financial advice to a broad clientele located through more than thirty offices in the United States of America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region. Together, the Company and its subsidiaries form an organization that provides financial services to meet a wide variety of client needs. The Company concentrates its efforts toward the earning of professional fees with focused services across the following
three
business segments: • Corporate Finance ("CF") provides general financial advisory services in addition to advice on mergers and acquisitions and capital markets offerings. We advise public and private institutions on a wide variety of situations, including buy-side and sell-side transactions, as well as leveraged loans, private mezzanine debt, high-yield debt, initial public offerings, follow-ons, convertibles, equity private placements, private equity, and liability management transactions, and advise financial sponsors on all types of transactions. The majority of our CF revenues consists of fees paid upon the successful completion of the transaction or engagement ("Completion Fees"). A CF transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons that are outside of our control. In these instances, our fees are generally limited to the fees paid at the time an engagement letter is signed ("Retainer Fees") and in some cases fees paid during the course of the engagement ("Progress Fees") that may have been received.
• Financial Restructuring ("FR") provides advice to debtors, creditors and other parties-in-interest in connection with recapitalization/deleveraging transactions implemented both through bankruptcy proceedings and through out-of-court exchanges, consent solicitations or other mechanisms, as well as in distressed mergers and acquisitions and capital markets activities. As part of these engagements, our FR business segment offers a wide range of advisory services to our clients, including: the structuring, negotiation, and confirmation of plans of reorganization; structuring and analysis of exchange offers; corporate viability assessment; dispute resolution and expert testimony; and procuring debtor-in-possession financing. Although atypical, FR transactions can fail to be completed for many reasons that are outside of our control. In these instances, our fees are generally limited to the Retainer Fees and/or Progress Fees.
• Financial and Valuation Advisory ("FVA") primarily provides valuations of various assets, including: companies; illiquid debt and equity securities; and intellectual property (among other assets and liabilities). These valuations are used for financial reporting, tax reporting, and other purposes. In addition, our FVA business segment renders fairness opinions in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other transactions, and solvency opinions in connection with corporate spin-offs and dividend recapitalizations, and other types of financial opinions in connection with other transactions. Also, our FVA business segment provides dispute resolution services to clients where fees are usually based on the hourly rates of our financial professionals. Unlike our CF or FR segments, the fees generated in our FVA segment are generally not contingent on the successful completion of a transaction.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and include all information and footnotes required for consolidated financial statement presentation. The results of operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (the "2022 Annual Report").
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries where it has a controlling financial interest. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Company carries its investments in unconsolidated entities over which it has significant influence but does not control using the equity method, and includes its ownership share of the income and losses in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The Company’s equity method investments include variable interest entities (VIEs), which are defined as entities in which equity investors (i) do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and/or (ii) do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The entity that consolidates a VIE is known as its primary beneficiary, and is generally the entity with (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (ii) the right to receive benefits from the VIE or the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Our involvement with VIEs arises from our variable interest related to a special purpose acquisition company of which the Company is a sponsor. The Company's exposure to loss from such VIEs is not material to our operating results and financial position. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Management estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the reporting date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to: the allowance for credit losses; the valuation of deferred tax assets, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, accrued expenses, and share based compensation; the allocation of goodwill and other assets across the reporting units (segments); and reserves for income tax uncertainties and other contingencies. Revenues Revenues consist of fee revenues from advisory services and reimbursed costs incurred in fulfilling the contracts. Revenues reflect fees generated from our CF, FR, and FVA business segments. The Company generates revenues from contractual advisory services and reimbursed costs incurred in fulfilling the contracts for such services. Revenues for all
three
business segments (CF, FR, and FVA) are recognized upon satisfaction of the performance obligation, which may be satisfied over time or at a point in time. The amount and timing of the fees paid vary by the type of engagement. 7 Table of Contents HOULIHAN LOKEY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED) (In thousands, except share data or as otherwise stated) The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those promised services (i.e., the “transaction price”). In determining the transaction price, we consider multiple factors, including the effects of variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainties with respect to the amount are resolved. In determining when to include variable consideration in the transaction price, we consider the range of possible outcomes, the predictive value of our past experiences, the time period of when uncertainties expect to be resolved and the amount of consideration that is susceptible to factors outside of our influence, such as market volatility or the judgment and actions of third parties. The substantial majority of the Company’s advisory fees (i.e., the success related Completion Fees) are considered variable and constrained as they are contingent upon a future event which includes factors outside of our control (e.g., completion of a transaction or third party emergence from bankruptcy or approval by the court).
Revenues for all three business segments are recognized upon satisfaction of the performance obligation and may be satisfied over time or at a point in time. The amount and timing of the fees paid vary by the type of engagement.
Revenues from CF engagements primarily consist of fees generated in connection with advisory services related to corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, and capital markets offerings. Completion Fees from these engagements are recognized at a point in time when the related transaction has been effectively closed. At that time, the Company has transferred control of the promised service and the customer obtains control. CF contracts generally contain a variety of promised services that may be capable of being distinct, but they are not distinct within the context of the contract as the various services are inputs to the combined output of successfully brokering a specific transaction.
Revenues from FR engagements primarily consist of fees generated in connection with advisory services to debtors, creditors and other parties-in-interest involving recapitalization or deleveraging transactions implemented both through bankruptcy proceedings and through out-of-court exchanges, consent solicitations or other mechanisms, as well as in distressed mergers and acquisitions and capital markets activities. Retainer Fees and Progress Fees from restructuring engagements are recognized over time
using a time elapsed measure of progress
as our clients simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of those services as they are provided. Completion Fees from these engagements are considered variable and constrained until the related transaction has been effectively closed as they are contingent upon a future event, which includes factors outside of our control (e.g., completion of a transaction or third party emergence from bankruptcy or approval by the court).
Revenues from FVA engagements primarily consist of fees generated in connection with valuation and diligence services and rendering fairness, solvency and other financial opinions. Revenues are recognized at a point in time as these engagements include a singular objective that does not transfer any notable value to the Company’s clients until the opinions have been rendered and delivered to the client. However, certain engagements consist of advisory services where fees are usually based on the hourly rates of our financial professionals. Such revenues are recognized over time as the benefits of these advisory services are transferred to the Company’s clients throughout the course of the engagement, and, as a practical expedient, the Company has elected to use the ‘as-invoiced’ approach to recognize revenue.
Taxes, including value added taxes, collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis, and therefore, are excluded from revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Operating Expenses The majority of the Company’s operating expenses are related to compensation for employees, which includes the amortization of the relevant portion of the Company’s share-based incentive plans (Note 14). Other types of operating expenses include: Travel, meals, and entertainment; Rent; Depreciation and amortization; Information technology and communications; Professional fees; and Other operating expenses . Translation of Foreign Currency Transactions The reporting currency for the consolidated financial statements of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar are included in the consolidation by translating the assets and liabilities at the reporting period-end exchange rates; however, revenues and expenses are translated using the applicable exchange rates determined on a monthly basis throughout the fiscal year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. 8 Table of Contents HOULIHAN LOKEY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED) (In thousands, except share data or as otherwise stated) From time to time, we enter into transactions to hedge our exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments or other methods. As of December 31, 2022 we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding between the pound sterling and the euro with a notional value of € 15.3  million. As of December 31, 2021, we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding between the pound sterling and the euro with a notional value of € 4.1  million. The change in fair value of these contracts represented a net gain/(loss) included in Other operating expenses of $( 589 ) and $ 11
during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Fair Value Measurements The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurement : • Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date. • Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. • Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date. For Level 3 investments in which pricing inputs are unobservable and limited market activity exists, management's determination of fair value is based upon the best information available, and may incorporate management's own assumptions or involve a significant degree of judgment. The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair value disclosures: • Corporate debt securities: All fair value measurements are obtained from a third-party pricing service and are not adjusted by management. • U.S. treasury securities: Fair values for U.S. treasury securities are based on quoted prices from recent trading activity of identical or similar securities. All fair value measurements are obtained from a third-party pricing service and are not adjusted by management. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the determination of which category within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate for any given investment is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument. The fair values of the financial instruments represent the amounts that would be received to sell assets or that would be paid to transfer liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants as of a specified date. Fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs; however, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Company’s own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Those judgments are developed by the Company based on the best information available in the circumstances, including expected cash flows and appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates, as well as available observable and unobservable inputs. The carrying value of Cash and cash equivalents, Restricted cash, Accounts receivable, Unbilled work in progress, Accounts payable and accrued expenses, and Deferred income approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. 9 Table of Contents HOULIHAN LOKEY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED) (In thousands, except share data or as otherwise stated) The carrying value of the loans to employees included in Other assets, Loans payable to former shareholders, and an unsecured loan which is included in Loan payable to non-affiliate approximates fair value due to the variable interest rate borne by those instruments. Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash Cash and cash equivalents include cash held at banks and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, the Company had cash balances with banks in excess of insured limits. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to Cash and cash equivalents. The following table provides a reconciliation of Cash and cash equivalents, and Restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Balance Sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.      December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 549,422   $ 833,697   Restricted cash
(1) 373   373   Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 549,795   $ 834,070   (1) Restricted cash as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 consisted of a cash secured letter of credit issued for our Frankfurt office. Investment Securities Investment securities consist primarily of corporate debt and U.S. treasury securities with original maturities over 90 days. The Company classifies its corporate debt and U.S. treasury securities as trading and measures them at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized holding gains and losses for trading securities are included in Other operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.      Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable and unbilled work in progress reflects management’s best estimate of expected losses using the Company's internal current expected credit losses model. This model analyzes expected losses based on relevant information about historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that could potentially affect the collectibility of the reported amounts. This is recorded through provision for bad debts, which is included in Other operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Amounts deemed to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for credit losses. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance charges are expensed as incurred and costs of renewals or improvements are capitalized at cost. Depreciation on furniture and office equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Income Taxes The Company files consolidated federal income tax returns, as well as consolidated and separate returns in state and local jurisdictions, and the Company reports income tax expense on this basis. We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities. The measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax rates. A valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 10 Table of Contents HOULIHAN LOKEY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED) (In thousands, except share data or as otherwise stated) The Company utilized a comprehensive model to recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements any uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken on a tax return. The impact of an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Interest expense and penalties related to income taxes are included in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income tax (“GILTI inclusion”) can be recognized in the financial statements through an accounting policy election by either recording a period cost (permanent item) or providing deferred income taxes stemming from certain basis differences that are expected to result in GILTI inclusion. The Company has elected to account for the tax impacts of the GILTI inclusion as a period cost. Leases We assess whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at the inception of the agreement. Right-of-use ("ROU") assets represent our right to use underlying assets for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from leases. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease terms utilizing the discount rate implicit in the leases. If the discount rate implicit in the leases is not readily determinable, the present value of future lease payments is calculated utilizing the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the interest that the Company would have to pay on a secured loan. The Company elected to utilize a portfolio approach and applies the rates to a portfolio of leases with similar terms and economic environments. The terms of our leases used to determine the ROU asset and lease liability account for options to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options, if applicable. ROU assets and lease liabilities are subject to adjustment in the event of modification to lease terms, changes in probability that an option to extend or terminate a lease would be exercised and other factors. In addition, ROU assets are periodically reviewed for impairment. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Lease expense includes amortization of the ROU assets and accretion of the lease liabilities. Amortization of ROU assets is calculated as the periodic lease cost less accretion of the lease liability. The amortized period for ROU assets is limited to the expected lease term. The Company has elected a practical expedient to combine the lease and non-lease components into a single lease component. The Company also elected the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption and does not establish ROU assets or lease liabilities for operating leases with terms of 12 months or less. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents an acquired company’s acquisition cost over the fair value of acquired net tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill is the net asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Intangible assets identified and accounted for include tradenames and marks, backlog, developed technologies, and customer relationships. Those intangible assets with finite lives, including backlog and customer relationships, are amortized over their estimated useful lives. 11 Table of Contents HOULIHAN LOKEY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED) (In thousands, except share data or as otherwise stated) Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and more frequently if potential impairment indicators exist. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011-08,
Testing Goodwill for Impairment , which permits management to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that one of its reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. If management concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then management would not be required to perform the two-step impairment test for that reporting unit. If the assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, management must test further for impairment utilizing a two-step process. Step 1 compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment exists and is measured in Step 2 as the excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill resulting from the valuation of the reporting unit. Impairment testing of goodwill requires a significant amount of judgment in assessing qualitative factors and estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, if necessary. The fair value is determined using an estimated market value approach, which considers estimates of future after tax cash flows, including a terminal value based on market earnings multiples, discounted at an appropriate market rate. As of December 31, 2022, management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the Company’s reporting units’ fair value was less than their carrying amount and no further impairment testing had been considered necessary. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with ASU 2012-02,
Testing Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets for Impairment , which provides management the option to perform a qualitative assessment. If it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value is recorded as an impairment expense. As of December 31, 2022, management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values were less than the carrying values. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group (inclusive of other long-lived assets) be tested for possible impairment, management first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. As of December 31, 2022, no events or changes in circumstances were identified that indicated that the carrying amount of the finite-lived intangible assets were not recoverable. Business Combinations Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. We allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date, with the consideration in excess recorded as goodwill. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, expected asset lives, geographic risk premiums, discount rates, and more. The amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. Note 3 —
Revenue Recognition Disaggregation of Revenues The Company has disclosed disaggregated revenues based on its business segment and geographical area, which provides a reasonable representation of how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. See Note 18 for additional information. Contract Balances The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by customers. The Company records a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to payment and there is an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, the Company records deferred income (contract liability) until the performance obligations are satisfied. 12 Table of Contents HOULIHAN LOKEY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED) (In thousands, except share data or as otherwise stated) Costs incurred in fulfilling advisory contracts with point-in-time revenue recognition are recorded as a contract asset when the costs (i) relate directly to a contract, (ii) generate or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying performance obligations, and (iii) are expected to be recovered. The Company amortizes the contract asset costs related to fulfilling a contract based on recognition of fee revenues for the corresponding contract. Costs incurred in fulfilling an advisory contract with over-time revenue recognition are expensed as incurred. The change in the Company’s contract assets and liabilities during the period primarily reflects the timing difference between the Company’s performance and the customer’s payment.

Loans Payable On August 23, 2019, the Company entered into a syndicated revolving line of credit with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other financial institutions party thereto (the “2019 Line of Credit”), which allows for borrowings of up to $ 100.0
million (and, subject to certain conditions, provides the Company with an expansion option, which, if exercised in full, would provide for a total credit facility of $ 200.0
million). On August 2, 2022, the agreement governing the 2019 Line of Credit was amended to, among other things, (a) extend the maturity to August 23, 2025 (or if such date is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day), (b) replace the LIBOR reference rate with Term SOFR plus an applicable credit spread adjustment, (c) modify certain covenant restrictions, and (d) make certain other technical amendments. The agreement governing the 2019 Line of Credit provides that commitment fees apply to unused amounts and contains debt covenants which require that the Company maintain certain financial ratios. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022,
no
principal was outstanding under the 2019 Line of Credit.
In April 2018, the Company acquired Quayle Munro Limited. Total consideration included non-interest bearing unsecured convertible loans totaling GBP
10.5
million payable on May 31, 2022, which was extinguished during the three months ended June 30, 2022. The Company incurred imputed interest expense on these notes of $ 0

million bearing interest at an annual rate of
2.88 % and payable on May 21, 2048. This note was subsequently assigned by the seller to the former BearTooth principals (who became employees of the Company), and, under certain circumstances, is convertible into Company Class B common stock after the fifth anniversary of the closing of the transaction. The Company incurred interest expense on this note of $ 0

Under the 2016 Incentive Plan, it is anticipated that the Company will continue to grant cash and equity-based incentive awards to eligible service providers in order to attract, motivate and retain the talent necessary to operate the Company's business. Equity-based incentive awards issued under the 2016 Incentive Plan generally vest over a

Commitments and Contingencies The Company has been named in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of the Company, in consultation with legal counsel, the final resolutions of these matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, operations and cash flows. The Company also provides routine indemnifications relating to certain real estate (office) lease agreements under which it may be required to indemnify property owners for claims and other liabilities arising from the Company’s use of the applicable premises. In addition, the Company guarantees the performance of its subsidiaries under certain office lease agreements. The terms of these obligations vary, and because a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated, the Company has determined that it is not possible to make an estimate of the maximum amount that it could be obligated to pay under such contracts. Based on historical experience and evaluation of specific indemnities, management believes that judgments, if any, against the Company related to such matters are not likely to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any liability for these obligations as of December 31, 2022 or March 31, 2022. There have been no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our known contractual obligations, which are set forth in the table included in Item 7 in our 2022 Annual Report. 23 Table of Contents HOULIHAN LOKEY, INC.

We make statements in this discussion that are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “targets,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “intends,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue,” the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future financial performance, based on our growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, the factors listed under the heading “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022 (the "2022 Annual Report"). Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this filing. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as a prediction of future events. We are under no duty to and we do not undertake any obligation to update or review any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this filing to conform our prior statements to actual results or revised expectations whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
Key Financial Measures Revenues Revenues include fee revenues and reimbursements of expenses (see Note 2 and Note 3 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information). Revenues reflect revenues from our Corporate Finance (“CF”), Financial Restructuring (“FR”), and Financial and Valuation Advisory (“FVA”) business segments that substantially consist of fees for advisory services. Revenues for all three business segments are recognized upon satisfaction of the performance obligation and may be satisfied over time or at a point in time. The amount and timing of the fees paid vary by the type of engagement. In general, advisory fees are paid at the time an engagement letter is signed (“Retainer Fees”), during the course of the engagement (“Progress Fees”), or upon the successful completion of a transaction or engagement (“Completion Fees”).
CF provides general financial advisory services in addition to advice on mergers and acquisitions and capital markets offerings. We advise public and private institutions on a wide variety of situations, including buy-side and sell-side transactions, as well as leveraged loans, private mezzanine debt, high-yield debt, initial public offerings, follow-ons, convertibles, equity private placements, private equity, and liability management transactions, and advise financial sponsors on all types of transactions. The majority of our CF revenues consists of Completion Fees. A CF transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons that are outside of our control. In these instances, our fees are generally limited to Retainer Fees and in some cases Progress Fees that may have been received.
FR provides advice to debtors, creditors and other parties-in-interest in connection with recapitalization/deleveraging transactions implemented both through bankruptcy proceedings and through out-of-court exchanges, consent solicitations or other mechanisms, as well as in distressed mergers and acquisitions and capital markets activities. As part of these engagements, our FR business segment offers a wide range of advisory services to our clients, including: the structuring, negotiation, and confirmation of plans of reorganization; structuring and analysis of exchange offers; corporate viability assessment; dispute resolution and expert testimony; and procuring debtor-in-possession financing. Although atypical, FR transactions can fail to be completed for many reasons that are outside of our control. In these instances, our fees are generally limited to the Retainer Fees and/or Progress Fees.
FVA primarily provides valuations of various assets, including: companies; illiquid debt and equity securities; and intellectual property (among other assets and liabilities). These valuations are used for financial reporting, tax reporting, and other purposes. In addition, our FVA business segment renders fairness opinions in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other transactions, and solvency opinions in connection with corporate spin-offs and dividend recapitalizations, and other types of financial opinions in connection with other transactions. Also, our FVA business segment provides dispute resolution services to clients where fees are usually based on the hourly rates of our financial professionals. Unlike our CF or FR segments, the fees generated in our FVA segment are generally not contingent on the successful completion of a transaction.
28 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are classified as employee compensation and benefits expense and non-compensation expense; revenue and headcount are the primary drivers of our operating expenses. Reimbursements of certain out-of-pocket deal expenses are recorded on a gross basis and are therefore included in both Revenues and Operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Employee Compensation and Benefits Expense.
Our employee compensation and benefits expense, which accounts for the majority of our operating expenses, is determined by management based on revenues earned, headcount, the competitiveness of the prevailing labor market, and anticipated compensation expectations of our employees. These factors may fluctuate, and as a result, our employee compensation and benefits expense may fluctuate materially in any particular period. Accordingly, the amount of employee compensation and benefits expense recognized in any particular period may not be consistent with prior periods or indicative of future periods. Our employee compensation and benefits expense consists of base salary, payroll taxes, benefits, annual incentive compensation payable as cash bonus awards, deferred cash bonus awards, and the amortization of equity-based bonus awards. Base salary and benefits are paid ratably throughout the year. Our annual equity-based bonus awards include fixed share compensation awards and liability classified fixed dollar awards as a component of the annual bonus awards for certain employees. These equity awards are generally subject to annual vesting requirements over a four-year period beginning at the date of grant, which occurs in the first quarter of each fiscal year; accordingly, expenses are amortized over the stated vesting period. In most circumstances, the unvested portion of these awards is subject to forfeiture should the employee depart from the Company. Cash bonuses, which are accrued monthly, are discretionary and dependent upon a number of factors including the Company's performance, and are generally paid in the first fiscal quarter of each fiscal year with respect to prior year performance. Generally, a portion of the cash bonus is deferred and paid in the third quarter of the fiscal year in which the bonus is awarded. Annual bonuses paid to employees of GCA Corporation (“GCA”) were historically paid in the first calendar quarter of each year and we maintained that schedule for calendar year 2022 and paid all GCA bonuses in the first calendar quarter of 2022 with respect to calendar year 2021 performance. Bonuses paid to GCA employees in 2022 included both cash and Houlihan Lokey, Inc., Class B common stock awards subject to vesting similar to what is described above. After the first calendar quarter 2022 payment, GCA is on the same bonus schedule as other Houlihan Lokey employees referred to above. We refer to the ratio of our employee compensation and benefits expenses to our revenues as our "Compensation Ratio." Non-Compensation Expense.
The balance of our operating expenses includes costs for travel, meals and entertainment, rent, depreciation and amortization, information technology and communications, professional fees, and other operating expenses. We refer to all of these expenses as non-compensation expenses. A portion of our non-compensation expenses fluctuates in response to changes in headcount. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net includes (i) interest income earned on non-marketable and investment securities, cash and cash equivalents, loans receivable from affiliates, employee loans, and commercial paper, (ii) interest expense and fees on our 2019 Line of Credit (defined herein), (iii) interest expense on the loan payable to affiliate, loans payable to former shareholders, and the loan payable to non-affiliates, (iv) equity income and/or gains or losses from funds and partnership interests where we have more than a minor ownership interest or more than minor influence over operations, but do not have a controlling interest and are not the primary beneficiary, and (v) gains and/or losses associated with the reduction/increase of earnout liabilities. Results of Consolidated Operations
The following is a discussion of our results of consolidated operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As described in Note 19 of Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, the Company completed the acquisition of GCA during the third quarter of fiscal 2022; therefore, our results of consolidated operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 include GCA. Although the comparative results of consolidated operations for the six months ended September 30, 2021, do not include GCA, the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 do include GCA. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the revenues and the operating expenses of our CF, FR, and FVA business segments in these periods, see Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Business Segments” below. 29 Table of Contents Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, ($ in thousands) 2022 2021 Change 2022 2021 Change Revenues $ 456,499  $ 888,798  (49) % $ 1,364,680  $ 1,798,792  (24) % Operating expenses: Employee compensation and benefits 289,348  549,376  (47) % 864,942  1,115,054  (22) % Non-compensation 82,978  90,162  (8) % 248,624  169,483  47  % Total operating expenses 372,326  639,538  (42) % 1,113,566  1,284,537  (13) % Operating income 84,173  249,260  (66) % 251,114  514,255  (51) % Other expense, net 563  253  123  % 7,416  1,005  638  % Income before provision for income taxes 83,610  249,007  (66) % 243,698  513,250  (53) % Provision for income taxes 20,559  74,699  (72) % 49,135  140,099  (65) % Net income 63,051  174,308  (64) % 194,563  373,151  (48) % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest —  (573) 100  % —  (573) 100  % Net income attributable to Houlihan Lokey, Inc. $ 63,051  $ 173,735  (64) % $ 194,563  $ 372,578  (48) % Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 versus December 31, 2021 Revenues were $456.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with $888.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of (49)%. Revenues decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of closed transactions. For the quarter, CF revenues decreased (59)%, FR revenues increased 11%, and FVA revenues decreased (21)% when compared with the three months ended December 31, 2021.
Operating expenses were $372.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with $639.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of (42)%. Employee compensation and benefits expense, as a component of operating expenses, was $289.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with $549.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of (47)%. The decrease in employee compensation and benefits expense was a result of a decrease in revenues for the quarter when compared with the same quarter last year. The Compensation Ratio was 63.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with 61.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Non-compensation expense, as a component of operating expenses, was $83.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with $90.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of (8)%. The decrease in non-compensation expense was primarily a result of a decrease in depreciation and amortization and a decrease in professional fees for the quarter when compared with the same quarter last year. Other expense, net was $0.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Other expense, net increased primarily due to the write-off of our equity method investment in Advanced Merger Partners, Inc. ("AMPI"), a special purpose acquisition company that we co-sponsored in 2021. The provision for income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $20.6 million, which reflected an effective tax rate of 24.6%. The provision for income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2021 was $74.7 million which reflected an effective tax rate of 30.0%. The decrease in the Company's tax rate during the three months ended December 31, 2022 relative to the same period in 2021 was primarily the result of decreased state taxes and decreased taxes due to foreign operations. 30 Table of Contents Nine Months Ended December 31,
2022 versus December 31, 2021 Revenues were $1,364.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared with $1,798.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of (24)%. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, CF revenues decreased (34)%, FR revenues increased 2%, and FVA revenues increased 2% when compared with the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Operating expenses were $1,113.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared with $1,284.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of (13)%. Employee compensation and benefits expense, as a component of operating expenses, was $864.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared with $1,115.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of (22)%. The decrease in employee compensation and benefits expense was a result of a decrease in revenues when compared to the same period last year. The Compensation Ratio was 63.4% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared with 62.0% for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Non-compensation expense, as a component of operating expenses, was $248.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared with $169.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 47%. The increase in non-compensation expense was primarily a result of an increase in other operating expenses and an increase in amortization of intangible assets recognized in connection with the acquisition of GCA, which were not included in the six months ended September 30, 2021, as the GCA acquisition closed October 4, 2021. Other expense, net increased to $7.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared with $1.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in the fair value of an earnout liability for one of our previous acquisitions, losses recognized in connection with periodic warrant revaluations, and the write-off of our equity method investment in AMPI, partially offset by an increase in gains recognized on investment securities and increased interest income. The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $49.1 million, which reflected an effective tax rate of 20.2%. The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 was $140.1 million, which reflected an effective tax rate of 27.3%. The decrease in the Company's tax rate during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 relative to the same period in 2021 was primarily the result of the release of the provision for an uncertain tax position as a result of the successful closure of a state audit, as well as increased stock compensation deductions. As of March 31, 2022, the Company had recorded unrecognized tax positions in the amounts of $18.7 million. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the Company received a Consent to Field Audit Adjustment from the State of New York for the years ended March 31, 2017, March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease to the Company's unrecognized tax benefits of $7.3 million was recognized as a result of this Consent to Field Audit Adjustment.
The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to $0.5 million in gross unrecognized income tax benefits for federal and state items may be necessary within the next 12 months. For the remaining uncertain income tax positions, it is difficult at this time to estimate the timing of the resolution.

(1) 373  373  Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, including investment securities $ 586,570  $ 943,213  (1) Represents a deposit in support of a letter of credit issued for our Frankfurt office. Our liquidity is highly dependent upon cash receipts from clients that are generally dependent upon the successful completion of transactions, as well as the timing of receivables collections, which typically occur within 60 days of billing. As of December 31, 2022, accounts receivable, net of credit losses was $138.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, unbilled work in progress, net of credit losses was $152.1 million.
On August 23, 2019, the Company entered into a syndicated revolving line of credit with the Bank of America, N.A. and certain other financial institutions party thereto, which allows for borrowings of up to $100.0 million (and, subject to certain conditions, provides the Company with an expansion option, which, if exercised in full, would provide for a total credit facility of $200.0 million) (the "2019 Line of Credit"). On August 2, 2022, the agreement governing the 2019 Line of Credit was amended to, among other things, (a) extend the maturity to August 23, 2025, (b) replace the LIBOR reference rate with Term SOFR plus an applicable credit spread adjustment, (c) modify certain covenant restrictions, and (d) make certain other technical amendments. As of December 31, 2022, no principal was outstanding under the 2019 Line of Credit. The loan agreement requires compliance with certain loan covenants including, but not limited to, the maintenance of minimum consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of no less than $150.0 million as of the end of any quarterly 12-month period and certain leverage ratios including a consolidated leverage ratio of less than 2.00 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2022, we were, and expect to continue to be, in compliance with such covenants.
The majority of the Company's payment obligations and commitments pertain to routine operating leases. The Company also has various obligations relating to notes payable and contingent consideration issued in connection with businesses previously acquired (see Note 10 included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). In connection with certain acquisitions, certain employees may be entitled to deferred consideration, primarily in the form of retention payments, should certain service and/or performance conditions be met in the future. As a result of these conditions, such deferred consideration would be expensed as compensation in current and future periods and a portion thereof has been accrued as liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022. 35 Table of Contents Cash Flows Our operating cash flows are primarily influenced by the amount and timing of receipt of advisory fees and the payment of operating expenses, including payments of incentive compensation to our employees. We pay a significant portion of our incentive compensation during the first and third quarters of each fiscal year. A summary of our operating, investing, and financing cash flows is as follows: Nine Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Change Operating activities: Net income $ 194,563  $ 373,151  (48) % Non-cash charges 200,452  118,975  68  % Other operating activities (496,890) 180,009  (376) % Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities (101,875) 672,135  (115) % Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities 36,458  (146,352) (125) % Net cash (used in) financing activities (207,839) (309,976) (33) % Effects of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (11,019) (4,055) 172  % Net increase/(decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (284,275) 211,752  (234) % Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash — beginning of period 834,070  847,224  (2) % Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash — end of period $ 549,795  $ 1,058,976  (48) % Nine Months Ended December 31, 2022 Operating activities resulted in a net outflow of $(101.9) million, primarily attributable to a significant decrease in accrued salaries and bonuses and income taxes payable. Investing activities resulted in a net inflow of $36.5 million, primarily attributable to sales or maturities of investment securities, offset by purchases of property and equipment. Financing activities resulted in a net outflow of $(207.8) million, primarily attributable to dividends paid, share repurchases, and payments to settle employee tax obligations on share-based awards. Nine Months Ended December 31, 2021 Operating activities resulted in a net inflow of $672.1 million, primarily attributable to strong performance across the Company. Investing activities resulted in a net outflow of $(146.4) million, primarily attributable to the acquisition of GCA, as described in Note 19. Financing activities resulted in a net outflow of $(310.0) million, primarily attributable to share repurchases, dividend payments, and payments to settle employee tax obligations on share-based awards. Contractual Obligations There have been no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our known contractual obligations, which are set forth in the table included in Item 7 in our 2022 Annual Report. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period for which they are determined to be necessary. Business Combinations Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. We allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date, with the consideration in excess recorded a goodwill. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, expected asset lives, geographic risk premiums, discount rates, and more. The amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. For additional information on critical accounting policies and estimates, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in the MD&A of the 2022 Annual Report. 36 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Developments For information on recently issued accounting developments and their impact or potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market Risk and Credit Risk Our business is not capital intensive and we generally do not issue debt or invest in derivative instruments, other than for foreign currency hedging purposes. As a result, we are not subject to significant market risk (including interest rate risk) or credit risk (except in relation to receivables). We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit ratings. Although these deposits are generally not insured, management believes we are not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held. Our cash and cash equivalents are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, pound sterling and euros, and we face foreign currency risk in our cash balances and other assets and liabilities held in accounts outside the U.S. due to potential currency movements and the associated foreign currency translation accounting requirements. We regularly review our accounts receivable and allowance for credit losses by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable and recoverable expense balances, and the current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay such amounts owed to us. We maintain an allowance for credit losses that, in our opinion, provides for an adequate reserve to cover losses that may be incurred. Risks Related to Cash and Short-Term Investments Our cash is maintained in U.S. and non-U.S. bank accounts. We have exposure to foreign exchange risks through all of our international affiliates. However, we believe our cash is not subject to any material interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk or other market risk. Consistent with our past practice, we expect to maintain our cash in bank accounts or highly liquid securities. Exchange Rate Risk The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in the non-U.S. countries in which we operate may have an effect on the reported value of our non-U.S. dollar denominated or based assets and liabilities and, therefore, be reflected as a change in other comprehensive income. Our non-U.S. assets and liabilities that are sensitive to exchange rates consist primarily of trade payables and receivables, work in progress, and cash. The recent strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies of our international operations has triggered foreign currency translation adjustments that are greater than usual. The net impact of the fluctuation of foreign currencies in other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income was $24,204 and $(1,824) during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $(26,659) and $(6,236) during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
In addition, the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the currencies in the non-U.S. countries in which we operate and the U.S. dollar, affecting our operating results. We have analyzed our potential exposure to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the pound sterling and euro, the primary currencies of our European operations, by performing a sensitivity analysis on our net income, and determined that while our earnings are subject to fluctuations from changes in foreign currency rates, at this time we do not believe we face any material risk in this respect. From time to time, we enter into transactions to hedge our exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments or other methods. As of December 31, 2022 we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding between the pound sterling and the euro with a notional value of €15.3 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding between the pound sterling and the euro with a notional value of €4.1 million. The change in fair value of these contracts represented a net gain/(loss) included in Other operating expenses of $(589) and $11 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. In summary, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and the potential impact of future currency fluctuation will increase as our international expansion continues. The magnitude of this impact will depend on the timing and volume of revenues and expenses of, and the amounts of assets and liabilities in, our foreign subsidiaries along with the timing of changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the currencies of the non-U.S. countries in which we operate.
37 Table of Contents Item 4.        Controls and Procedures Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting performed during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.    Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. There has been no material change in the nature of our legal proceedings from the descriptions contained in our 2022 Annual Report.
