NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note
1—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis
of Presentation
The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Zedge, Inc. and its subsidiaries, GuruShots Ltd. (“GuruShots”),
Zedge Europe AS and Zedge Lithuania UAB (the “Company”), have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP
for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered
necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2023 or any other period. The balance sheet at
July 31, 2022 has been derived from the Company’s audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information
and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. For further information, please refer to the consolidated
financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July
31, 2022, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
The
Company’s fiscal year ends on July 31 of each calendar year. Each reference below to a fiscal year refers to the fiscal year
ending in the calendar year indicated (e.g., fiscal 2022 refers to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022).
Reportable
Segments
Effective
August 1, 2022, the Company revised the presentation of segment information to reflect its acquisition of GuruShots (see Note 5). As
such, the Company now reports operating results through two reportable segments: Zedge App and GuruShots, as further discussed in Note
12
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as related disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ materially from the Company’s estimates due to risks and uncertainties,
including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to various global events. To the extent that there are material differences
between these estimates and actual results, the Company’s financial condition or operating results will be affected. The Company
bases its estimates on past experience and other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances, and the
Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis.
Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which requires the measurement and
recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment
model with an expected loss model which requires consideration of forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates. These
changes will result in an earlier recognition of credit losses. The Company’s financial assets held at amortized cost include accounts
receivable. The amendments in ASU 2020-05 deferred the effective date for Topic 326 to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022.
The Company will adopt the new standard effective August 1, 2023 and does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material
impact on its consolidated financial statements.
5
In
October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08,
Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities From Contracts With Customers .
ASU 2021-08 requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities from acquired
contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606,
Revenue from
Contracts with Customers , rather than the prior requirement to record them at fair value. The guidance is effective for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt
the new standard effective August 1, 2023 and does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements.
With
the exception of the standards discussed above, there have been no other recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements
during the six months ended January 31, 2023, as compared to the recent accounting pronouncements described in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, that are of significance or potential significance to the Company.
Related
Party Transactions
The
Company was formerly a majority-owned subsidiary of IDT Corporation (“IDT”). On June 1, 2016, IDT’s interest in the
Company was spun-off by IDT to IDT’s stockholders and the Company became an independent public-held company. IDT charges the Company
for services it provides, and the Company charges IDT for services it provides, pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”).
The
Company is party to a consulting agreement with Activist Artist Management, LLC (“Activist”), which assists the company in
strategic business development. A member of the Company’s Board of Directors owns a significant minority stake in Activist.
Related
party transactions with these related parties did not have a material impact to the consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2023
or July 31, 2022, or the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three and six months ended January
31, 2023 or 2022.

Contract
Balances
The
Company enters into contracts with its customers, which may give rise to contract liabilities (deferred revenue) and contract assets
(unbilled revenue). The payment terms and conditions within the Company’s contracts vary by products or services purchased, the
substantial all of which are due in less than one year. When the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of payments made
by customers, the Company recognizes only deferred revenue (customer payment is received in advance of performance). The Company does
not have unbilled revenue (its performance precedes the billing date).
6
Deferred
revenues
On
April 1, 2022, the AppLovin Corporation paid the Company a one-time integration bonus of $ 2
million for migrating to their mediation
platform. This amount is being amortized over an estimated service period of 24 months. The Company’s deferred revenue balance
related to this bonus was approximately $ 1.2
million and $ 1.7
million as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively.
The
Company records deferred revenues related to the unsatisfied performance obligations with respect to subscription revenue. The Company’s
deferred revenue balance related to paid subscriptions was approximately $1.4 million related to approximately 654,000 active subscribers,
and approximately $1.5 million, related to approximately 692,000 active subscribers as of January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively.
The amount of revenue related to subscribers recognized in the six months ended January 31, 2023 that was included in the deferred balance
at July 31, 2022 was $1.1 million.
The
Company also records deferred revenues when users purchase or earn Zedge Credits. Unused Zedge Credits represent the value of the Company’s
unsatisfied performance obligation to its users. Revenue is recognized when Zedge App users use Zedge Credits to acquire Zedge Premium
content or upon expiration of the Zedge Credits upon 180 days of account inactivity. As of January 31, 2023, and July 31, 2022, the Company’s
deferred revenue balance related to Zedge Premium was approximately $ 268,000
and $ 259,000 , respectively.
Total
deferred revenues decreased by $ 0.6
million from $ 3.4
million at July 31, 2022 to $ 2.8
million at January 31, 2023, primarily attributed
to the amortization of the one-time integration bonus mentioned above.
Significant
Judgments
The
advertising networks and advertising exchanges to which the Company sell its inventory track and report the impressions and installs
to Zedge and Zedge recognizes revenues based on these reports. The networks and exchanges base their payments off of those reports and
Zedge independently compares the data to each of the client sites to validate the imported data and identify any differences. The number
of impressions and installs delivered by the advertising networks and advertising exchanges is determined at the end of each month, which
resolves any uncertainty in the transaction price during the reporting period.
Practical
Expedients
The
Company expenses the fees retained by Google Play related to subscription revenue when incurred as marketing expense because the duration
of the contracts for which the Company pays commissions are less than one year. These costs are included in the selling, general and
administrative expenses of the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

Contingent
Consideration
Contingent
consideration related to the business combinations discussed below in Note 5 are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
as the determination of fair value uses considerable judgement and represents the Company’s best estimate of an amount that could
be realized in a market exchange for the asset or liability.
The
following table provides a rollforward of the contingent consideration related to the GuruShots acquisition (in thousands):
Balance at July 31, 2022
$ 1,943
Change in fair value
( 1,943 )
Balance at January 31, 2023
$ 0
The
overall fair value of the contingent consideration decreased by $ 1,943,000
during the six months ended January 31, 2023, due primarily
to the decrease in the likelihood that certain contingent milestones would be achieved.
Fair
Value of Other Financial Instruments
Fair
value of the outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts are marked to market price at the end of each measurement period.
The
Company’s other financial instruments at January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 included trade accounts receivable and trade accounts
payable. The carrying amounts of the trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable approximated fair value due to their short-term
nature.
Note
4—Derivative Instruments
The
primary risk managed by the Company using derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. Foreign exchange forward contracts are entered
into as hedges against unfavorable fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar (USD) to Norwegian Kroner (NOK) and USD to Euro (EUR) exchange rates.
The Company is party to a Foreign Exchange Agreement with Western Alliance Bank allowing the Company to enter into foreign exchange contracts
under its revolving credit facility with the bank (see Note 11). The Company does not apply hedge accounting to these contracts, and
therefore the changes in fair value are recorded in unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. By using derivative instruments to mitigate exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates, the Company is exposed to credit
risk from the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the contract. The credit or repayment risk is minimized by entering
into transactions with high-quality counterparties.
The
outstanding contracts at January 31, 2023, were as follows:

5—Business Combination and Assets Acquisition
GuruShots
Acquisition
On
April 12, 2022, the Company consummated the acquisition of
100 % of the outstanding equity securities of GuruShots, Ltd., an Israeli company
that operates a platform used for its competitive photography game available across iOS, Android and the web. The acquisition was effected
pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) between the Company, GuruShots and the holders of the GuruShots equity
interests. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting and the results of
operations of GuruShots have been included in the Company’s results of operations as of the acquisition date.
The
purchase price for the equity securities of GuruShots consists of approximately $ 18
million in cash paid at closing and contingent payments
(the “Earnout”) of up to a maximum of $ 8.4
million due on each of the first and second anniversaries from the closing, payable
either in cash or Class B common stock of the Company or a combination thereof, at the Company’s discretion, and subject to GuruShots
achieving certain financial targets set forth in the SPA. The fair value of the earnout amount at the acquisition date was estimated
at $ 5.9
million based on a Monte Carlo simulation model in an option pricing framework, whereby a range of possible scenarios were simulated.
This fair value was reduced from $ 5.9
million to $ 1.9
million as of July 31, 2022 and further reduced to $ 0
as of January 31, 2023. See
Note 3,
Fair Value Measurements , for additional discussion of contingent consideration as of January 31, 2023.
Under
the SPA, the Company has agreed to make certain minimum investments in user acquisition for GuruShots in the period covered by the Earnout,
subject to the acquired users generating minimum levels of Return On Ad Spend (“ROAS”) as set forth in the SPA. As of January
31, 2023, due to market conditions in the mobile/on-line gaming industry and other factors, the Company was not on track to make the
minimum investment for the first annual period covered by the Earnout. Based on the data from the user acquisition investment made, the
Company does not believe that the minimum ROAS would have been maintained from the additional investment.
In
addition,
the Company has committed to a retention pool of $4 million in cash and 626,242 shares of the Company Class B common stock
(the number of shares was determined based on a value of $4 million or $6.39 per share which was the volume weighted average closing
prices of the Class B common stock on the NYSE American Exchange for the thirty trading days ended April 12, 2022) for GuruShots’
founders and employees that will be payable or vest, as applicable, over three years from April 1, 2022 based on the beneficiaries thereof
remaining employed by the Company or a subsidiary.
The
parties to the SPA have made customary representations, warranties and covenants therein. The assertions embodied in those representations
and warranties were made for purposes of the SPA and are subject to qualifications and limitations agreed by the respective parties in
connection with negotiating the terms of the SPA.
9
The
cash purchase price and the earnout have been allocated to GuruShots’ tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed
liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The preliminary fair value estimates of the net assets acquired are based upon preliminary
calculations and valuations, and those estimates and assumptions are subject to change as the Company obtains additional information
for those estimates during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The excess of the total consideration over
the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill.
The
Company will record measurement period adjustments based on its ongoing valuation and purchase price allocation procedures. The Company
is still finalizing the valuation and purchase price allocation as it relates to the net working capital amount in the table below.
The
allocation of the preliminary purchase price is as follows (in thousands):

The
cash consideration paid includes $ 2.7
million deposited with the escrow agent that is available to satisfy for post-closing indemnification
claims made within 18 months of the acquisition date. There have been no claims made as of January 31, 2023.
The
earnout amount to be paid (up to the maximum of $ 16.8
million) will be determined based upon the satisfaction of certain defined operational
milestones and will be remeasured at fair value at each reporting period through earnings. As the fair value is based on unobservable
inputs, the liabilities are included in Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy. The unobservable inputs used in the determination
of the fair value of the earnout which is assumed to be paid in cash include management’s reasonable assumptions about the likelihood
of payment based on the satisfaction of certain defined operational milestones and discount rates based on cost of debt.
The
Company has issued 616,848 (net of forfeiture of 9,394 shares) shares of the Company’s Class B common in respect of the retention
pool to the GuruShots founders and employees, which will be held by a trustee based in Israel when those shares vest. These shares will
vest, in equal tranches, over three years assuming that the recipients remain employed by the Company or a subsidiary through the vesting
dates. The grant date $4 million fair value of these unvested restricted stock is not included as purchase consideration above, as it
has a post-combination service requirement and will be accounted for separately from the business combination as stock compensation expense.
Additionally, the founders and employees are also entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $4 million retention cash bonus over three
years subject to the same continued service requirement, which was not included in the purchase price above.
As of January 31, 2023,
the Company has accrued $ 1.1
million in retention bonus which is included in the accrued expense and other current liabilities.
10
Identified
intangible assets consist of trade names, technology and customer relationships. The fair value of intangible assets and the determination
of their respective useful lives were made in accordance with ASC 805 and are outlined in the table below:
(Dollar Amounts in Thousands)

Customer relationships

Total identified intangible assets
$ 15,320
The
Company’s initial fair value estimates related to the various identified intangible assets were determined under various valuation
approaches including the relief-from-royalty method and multi-period excess earnings. These valuation methods require management to project
revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital spending and cash flows for GuruShots over a multiyear period, as well
as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate.
The
Company amortizes its intangible assets assuming no residual value over periods in which the economic benefit of these assets is consumed.
The
Company recorded the excess of the purchase price over the identified tangible and intangible assets as goodwill. The Company believes
that the investment value of the future enhancement of the Company’s products and offerings created as a result of this acquisition
has principally contributed to a purchase price that resulted in the recognition of $ 8.9
million of goodwill, which has been reduced
by $ 180,000
subsequently related to accounts payable balance as of the closing date. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisition-related
transaction costs (e.g., legal, due diligence, valuation, and other professional fees) are not included as a component of consideration
transferred but are required to be expensed as incurred. During fiscal 2022, we incurred $ 860,000
of acquisition-related costs, which
are included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income.
Emojipedia
Acquisition
Pursuant
to an Asset Purchase Agreement, on August 1, 2021 (“Closing”), the Company consummated the acquisition of substantially all
of the assets of Emojipedia Pty Ltd, a proprietary company organized under the laws of Australia. The total purchase price of the assets
was $6.7 million, of which $4.8 million was paid on August 2, 2021, $917,000 was paid on February 1, 2022, and the remaining $962,000
paid on August 2, 2022.
The $ 4.8
million was funded into an escrow account and classified as other assets on our consolidated balance
sheet as of July 31, 2021.
The
assets purchased include emojipeida.org, a set of smaller websites, a bank of emoji related URLs related to the seller’s business,
including World Emoji Day, the annual World Emoji Awards, and Emojitracker. The asset purchase does not qualify as a business combination
under FASB ASC 805,  Business Combinations , and has therefore been accounted for as an asset acquisition. The total purchase
price for this acquisition was allocated to intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives
of
fifteen years .

8—Stock-Based Compensation
The
2016 Incentive Plan
On
March 23, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors amended the Company’s 2016 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (as amended to
date, the “2016 Incentive Plan”) to increase the number of shares of the Company’s Class B common stock available for
the grant of awards thereunder by an additional
685,000
shares to an aggregate of
2,531,000
shares, including
626,000
shares for the
GuruShots retention pool. This amendment was ratified by the Company’s stockholders at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held
on January 18, 2023.
On
November 10, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors amended the 2016 Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of the Company’s
Class B common stock available for the grant of awards thereunder by an additional
325,000
shares to an aggregate of
1,846,000
shares.
This amendment was ratified by the Company’s stockholders at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on January 12, 2022.
At
January 31, 2023, there were
421,000
shares of Class B common stock available for awards under the 2016 Incentive Plan before accounting
for the
204,000
contingently issuable shares related to the deferred stock units (“DSUs”) with both service and market conditions.
Stock-based
compensation
The
Company recognizes stock-based compensation for stock-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock and DSUs based on the estimated
fair value of the awards and recognized over the relevant service period and/or market conditions. The Company estimates the fair value
of stock options on the measurement date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Company estimates the fair value of the
restricted stock and DSU’s with service conditions only using the current market price of the stock. The Company estimates the
fair value of the DSU’s with both service and market conditions using the Monte Carlo Simulation valuation model.
The
Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo Simulation valuation models incorporate assumptions as to stock price volatility, the expected life of
options or awards, a risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to options
and restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally
4
years for options and
3
years for restricted stock units.
In
our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, the Company recognized stock-based
compensation expense for our employees and non-employees as follows:

Company’s Class B common stock in connection with the GuruShots acquisition.
In
the six months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company purchased
6,310
shares and
16,115
shares respectively of Class B Stock from
certain employees for $ 17,000
and $ 232,000
respectively, to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted
stock and DSUs.
Repricing
of Outstanding and Unexercised Options
On
October 20, 2022, the Board unanimously approved the repricing of all outstanding and unexercised stock options granted under the 2016
Plan that were out-of-the-money and held by current employees, executive officers, and consultants of the Company (the “Eligible
Stock Options”). Effective October 20, 2022, the exercise price of the eligible stock options was reduced to $ 2.27 , the closing
price of its common stock on October 19, 2022. Except for the modification to the exercise price of the Eligible Stock Options, all other
terms and conditions of each of the Eligible Stock Options will remain in full force and effect.
13
Pursuant
to the Plan, the Board, as the administrator of the Plan, has discretionary authority, exercisable on such terms and conditions that
it deems appropriate under the circumstances, to reduce the exercise price in effect for outstanding options under the Plans. In approving
the repricing, the Board considered the impact of the current exercise prices of outstanding stock options on the incentives provided
to employees and consultants, the lack of retention value provided by the outstanding stock options to employees and consultants, and
the impact of such options on the capital structure of the Company. As of October, 2022, there were
532,750
stock options outstanding
under the 2016 Plan, of which
191,663
outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the market price of the Company’s
common stock as of October 20, 2022, which is why the Board made the determination to deem all outstanding and unexercised stock options
held by current employees, executive officers, and consultants as Eligible Stock Options.
Jonathan
Reich, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, and Yi Tsai, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, hold Eligible Stock Options
exercisable for an aggregate of
64,898
and
15,000
shares of the Company’s common stock, respectively.
The
option repricing resulted in incremental stock-based compensation of $ 87,000 , of which $ 43,000
was recorded as expense in the six months
ended January 31, 2023, and $ 44,000
will be recognized as expense over the requisite service periods over which the Eligible Stock Options
vest.
Note
9—Earnings Per Share
Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to all classes of common stockholders of the Company by the weighted
average number of shares of all classes of common stock outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share is computed
in the same manner as basic earnings per share, except that the number of shares is increased to include restricted stock still subject
to risk of forfeiture, issuances to be made on the vesting of unvested DSUs and the exercise of potentially dilutive stock options using
the treasury stock method, unless the effect of such increase is anti-dilutive.
The
rights of holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical except for certain voting and conversion rights and
restrictions on transferability. As such, the Company is not required to break out earnings per share by class.
The
weighted-average number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to the Company’s

10—Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
In
connection with the acquisition of GuruShots, the Company has (i) committed to a retention pool of $ 4
million in cash to be paid to the
founders and employees of GuruShots that will be payable over three years from April 1, 2022 based on the beneficiaries thereof remaining
employed by the Company or a subsidiary; and (ii) agreed to make certain minimum investments in user acquisition for GuruShots in the
period covered by the earnout to be contingently paid to the prior owners of GuruShots subject to the acquired users generating minimum
levels ROAS. As of January 31, 2023, due to market conditions in the mobile/on-line gaming industry and other factors, the Company was
not on track to make the minimum investment for the first annual period covered by the Earnout. Based on the data from the user acquisition
investment made, the Company does not believe that the minimum ROAS would have been maintained from the additional investment.
Legal
Proceedings
The
Company may from time to time be subject to other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although there can
be no assurance in this regard, the Company does not expect any of those legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
Note
11—Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities
As
of September 27, 2016, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank for a revolving credit facility
of up to $ 2.5
million for an initial two-year term which was extended twice for another two-year term which expired September 26, 2022
and was amended on October 28, 2022 as discussed below. The revolving credit facility was secured by a lien on substantially all of the
Company’s assets. Effective with the September 2020 extension, the outstanding principal amount bore interest per annum at the
greater of
3.5 % or the prime rate plus
1.25 %.
Previously the interest rate was capped at 5.0%. Interest was payable monthly and all outstanding
principal and any accrued and unpaid interest was due on the maturity date of September 26, 2022.
The Company was required to pay an
annual facility fee of $ 10,000
to Western Alliance Bank. The Company was also required to comply with various affirmative and negative
covenants and to maintain certain financial ratios during the term of the revolving credit facility. The covenants included a prohibition
on the Company paying any dividend on its capital stock. At October 27, 2022 and July 31, 2022, there were no amounts outstanding under
the revolving credit facility and the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants.
On
October 28, 2022, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (“Amended Loan Agreement”)
with Western Alliance Bank. Pursuant to the Amended Loan Agreement, Western Alliance Bank agreed to provide the Company with a new term
loan facility in the maximum principal amount of $7 million for a four-year term and a $4 million revolving credit facility for a two-year
term.
Amounts outstanding under the term loan and credit facility of the Amended Loan Agreement bear interest at a per annum rate equal
to the Prime Rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal) plus
0.5 %, with a Prime “floor” rate of
4.00 %.
Pursuant
to the Amended Loan Agreement, the Company discontinued the existing $ 2
million revolving credit facility under the prior version of
the Loan and Security Agreement. At the time of the discontinuance, there was no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility.
Pursuant
to the Amended Loan Agreement, $ 2
million was advanced in a single-cash advance on October 28, 2022, with the remaining $ 5
million available
for drawdown during twenty-four (24) months after closing. Each drawdown must be in an amount of not less than One Million Dollars ($ 1
million).
Interest
accrued under the Amended Loan Agreement is due monthly, and the Company shall make monthly interest-only payments related to the term
loan through the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the closing date. From the nineteen (19) month anniversary of the Closing Date through
the maturity date, the Company shall repay each outstanding term loan by paying the Applicable Term Advance Amortization Payment equal
to 1/12 th

As
of November 16, 2016, the Company entered into a Foreign Exchange Agreement with Western Alliance Bank to allow the Company to enter
into foreign exchange contracts not to exceed $5.0 million in the aggregate at any point in time under its revolving credit facility.
This limit was raised to approximately $7.5 million pursuant to the Loan and Security Modification Agreement dated May 30, 2018. The
available borrowing under the revolving credit facility is reduced by an applicable foreign exchange reserve percentage as determined
by Western Alliance Bank, in its reasonable discretion from time to time, which was set at 10% of the nominal amount of the foreign exchange
contracts in effect at the relevant time.
At January 31, 2023, there were $ 1.8
million of outstanding foreign exchange contracts, which
reduced the available borrowing under the revolving credit facility by $ 180,000 .

12—Segment and Geographic Information
Segment
Information
Operating
segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief
operating decision maker (“CODM”), or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer as of January 31, 2023. Based on the criteria established
by ASC 280,
Segment Reportin g, the Company had one operating and reportable segment as of July 31, 2022.
Beginning
in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company revised the presentation of segment information to align with changes to how the Company’s
CODM manages the business, allocates resources and assesses operating performance reports operating results based on two reportable segments,
which are Zedge App and GuruShots.
16
The
CODM evaluates the performance of each operating segment using revenue and income (loss) from operations. The following table provides

13— Operating Leases
The
Company has operating leases primarily for office space. Operating lease right-of-use assets recorded and included in other assets were
$ 130,000
and $ 204,000
at January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively.
There
were no material changes in the Company’s operating and finance leases in the six months ended January 31, 2023, as compared to
the disclosure in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022.
Note
14—Provision for Income Taxes
The
Company’s tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods has generally been determined using an estimate of its
annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income and records the discrete tax items in the period to which they relate.
In each quarter, the Company updates the estimated annual effective tax rate and makes a year-to-date adjustment to the tax
provision as necessary.
The
Company’s annual effective tax rate for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2023 differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due
to certain factors with temporary differences primarily related to equity compensation expenses.
As
of January 31, 2023, the Company had $ 3.5
million of deferred tax assets for which it has established a valuation allowance of $ 1.9
million,
related to U.S. federal and state taxes and for a certain international subsidiary.
The
Company is subject to taxation in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Earnings from non-U.S. activities are subject
to local country income tax. The material jurisdictions where the Company is subject to potential examination by tax authorities include
the United States, Norway, Lithuania and Israel.

Note
15—Subsequent Events
In
December 2019, the Company launched ‘Shortz’ an entertainment app offering serialized, short-form fiction rendered in both
text-message and audio formats available across both Android and iOS. Shortz did not gain much tractions with the Company’s users,
and on March 8, 2023, the Company turned off the app and removed it from Google and Apple app stores. The Company will write off the
remaining unamortized capitalized software development costs of approximately $ 124,000
in the third quarter ended April 30, 2023.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following information should be read in conjunction
with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the associated notes thereto of this Quarterly Report,
and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 (the “Form
10-K”), as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
As used below, unless the context otherwise requires,
the terms “the Company,” “Zedge,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Zedge, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation and its subsidiaries, GuruShots Ltd., Zedge Europe AS and Zedge Lithuania UAB, collectively.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including
statements that contain the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “plans,” “intends,”
and similar words and phrases. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially from future results. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) Economic, geopolitical
and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and
profitability, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price; (2) Our ability to successfully make acquisitions and/or successfully
integrate acquisitions that we have made into Zedge without incurring unanticipated costs or without being subject to other integration
issues that may disrupt our existing operations; (3) Delay or failure to realize the expected synergies and benefits of the GuruShots
acquisition; (4) The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our employees, customers, partners, and the global financial markets; and (5)
Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine, and the international community’s response. For further information regarding risks and
uncertainties associated with our business, please refer to Item 1A to Part I “Risk Factors” in the Form 10-K. The forward-looking
statements are made as of the date of this report and we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements, or to update the
reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Investors should consult all of the information
set forth in this report and the other information set forth from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Securities
Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including the Form 10-K.
Geo-Political and Macroeconomic Conditions
and the COVID-19 Pandemic
We are subject to risks and uncertainties caused
by events with significant macroeconomic impacts, including but not limited to, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, rising interest rates,
actions taken to counter inflation, reduced consumer confidence, supply side disruptions, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The future and full
impact that these factors may have on our business, financial condition, and results of operations is unclear. The risks related to our
business are further described in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
and those discussed under Item 1A to Part I “Risk Factors” in the Form 10-K.
Impact of Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine
We are closely monitoring the current and potential
impact on our business, our people, and our users/customers as Russia’s war with Ukraine evolves. We have taken steps to comply
with applicable domestic and international regulatory restrictions on international trade and financial transactions. Revenues associated
with our users/customers in Russia and Belarus are not material to our consolidated financial results, and we anticipate that blocking
Russian and Belarus users/customers’ access to our mobile app and web platforms will not have a material impact on our business.
Management and our Board of Directors are monitoring the regional and global ramifications of the continuing events.
Overview
Zedge, Inc. (“Zedge”) builds digital
marketplaces and friendly competitive games around content that people use to express themselves. Our leading products include Zedge Ringtones
and Wallpapers, a freemium digital content marketplace offering mobile phone wallpapers, video wallpapers, ringtones, and notification
sounds which historically was branded as Zedge Premium, and GuruShots, a skill-based photo challenge game. Our vision is to connect creators
who enjoy friendly competitions with a community of prospective consumers in order to drive commerce.
19
We are part of the ‘Creator Economy,’
where over 1 billion people create and share their content across social platforms, mobile, and video games, and content marketplaces.
Within this group of individuals, over 200 million identify as creators, people who use their influence, skill, and creativity to amass
an audience and monetize it. Furthermore, approximately 12% of full-time creators earn more than $50,000 per year, and 10% of influencers
earn more than $100,000 per year. We view the Creator Economy as an untapped opportunity for Zedge to expand its business, especially
as we execute by connecting our gamers with our marketplace.
The Zedge Ringtones and Wallpapers app (which
is named “Zedge Wallpapers” in the App Store), which we refer to as our “Zedge App,” is a marketplace offering
a wide array of mobile personalization content including wallpapers, video wallpapers, ringtones, and notification sounds, and is available
both in Google Play and the App Store. As of January 31, 2023, our Zedge App has been installed nearly 596 million times since inception
and, over the past two years, has had between 31.9 and 36.3 million monthly active users (“MAU”). MAU is a key performance
indicator (“KPI”) that captures the number of unique users that used our Zedge App during the final 30 days of the relevant
period. Our platform allows creators to upload content to our marketplace and avail it to our users either for free or for a price, via
‘Zedge Premium.’ In turn, our users utilize the content to personalize their phones and express their individuality.
In fiscal 2022 we introduced several new customer
facing product features including ‘NFTs Made Easy’ and social and community features, all meant to improve customer engagement,
MAU, and revenue growth over the long term. In addition, we migrated to a new ad mediation platform - Applovin MAX. Applovin paid us a
one-time $2 million integration bonus and their performance has been on-par or better than our prior platform.
The Zedge App’s monetization stack consists
of advertising revenue generated when users view advertisements when using the Zedge App or surfing our website, the in-app sale of Zedge
Credits, our virtual currency, that is used to purchase Zedge Premium content, and a paid-subscription offering that provides an ad-free
experience to users that purchase a monthly or annual subscription. As of January 31, 2023, we had approximately 654,000 active paying
subscribers.
In late 2021, we introduced NFT functionality
to a limited number of Zedge Premium creators via ‘NFTs Made Easy’. Over time we believe this product enhancement has the
potential to drive significant artist growth and revenue production. ‘NFTs Made Easy’ is an eco-friendly platform that enables
artists and consumers to sell and purchase NFTs within the Zedge App even though they may lack deep knowledge and proficiency in the crypto
space. All transactions are made using Zedge Credits.
In April 2022, we acquired GuruShots, a recognized
category leader focused on gamifying the photography vertical. GuruShots offers a platform spanning iOS, Android, and the web that provides
a fun, educational and structured way for amateur photographers to compete in a wide variety of contests showcasing their photos while
gaining recognition with votes, badges, and awards. We estimate that the total addressable market of amateur photographers using their
smartphones to take and publicly share artistic photos is 30-40 million people per month and that the market is still in its infancy.
Every month, GuruShots stages more than 345 competitions that result in players uploading in excess of 1 million photographs and casting
close to 4+ billion “perceived votes”, which are calculated by multiplying the number of votes that each player casts by a
weighting factor based on various factors related to that user. To improve engagement, GuruShots has adopted a set of retention dynamics
focused on individual, team and community dynamics that create a sense of belonging, inspiration, recognition, improvement, and competition.
Today, GuruShots utilizes a ‘Free-to-Play’
business model that leads to strong monetization with the purchase of resources that are used to give paying players an edge while still
maintaining a fair and competitive experience for all participants. Over the past six years, the monthly average paying player spend has
increased in excess of 11.2% annually to more than $50.1 per player.
As we look to the future, we are advancing several
initiatives that we expect will drive user growth, increase engagement, drive in-app purchases, and advance our in-game economy. Some
of these include:
●
On-Boarding . Revamping the customer onboarding experience in order to maximize first time purchasers by immediately drawing new players into simplified photo competitions that are limited to a small audience taking place in a short time duration.
●
Economy . Evolving the game economy by maturing the game’s progression mechanics and features, earn and spend dynamics, and introducing soft and premium currencies tied to resources and benefits. Furthermore, we hope to introduce an advertising layer in the monetization stack in the future.
20
We market GuruShots to prospective players, primarily
via paid user acquisition channels, and utilize a host of creative formats including static and video ads in order to promote the game.
Our marketing team invests material resources in analyzing all attributes of a campaign ranging from the creative assets, offer acquisition
channel, and platform (i.e., iOS, Android, and web), just to name a few, with the goal of determining whether a specific campaign is likely
to yield a profitable customer. When we unearth a successful combination of these variables we scale up until we experience diminishing
returns. Ultimately, we believe that the efforts we are making to advance the product coupled with the investment in user acquisition
can significantly increase GuruShots’ player base.
Beyond our commitment to growing both the Zedge
App and GuruShots on a standalone basis, we believe that there are many potential synergies that we can capitalize on that exist between
the two businesses. Specifically, we plan to enable the ability for GuruShots players to become Zedge Premium artists and sell their photos
to our audience of 30+ million MAU as standard digital images or NFTs. In addition, we look to benefit from the experience that the GuruShots
team possesses and test gamifying the Zedge App. We believe that successful gamification can contribute to increasing engagement, retention,
and lifetime value, all critical KPIs for our business. Longer term, we believe that there are complementary content verticals that lend
themselves to gamification.
In August 2021, we acquired the assets of Emojipedia
Pty Ltd (“Emojipedia”), including Emojipedia.org the world’s leading authority dedicated to providing up-to-date and
well-researched emoji definitions, information, and news as well as World Emoji Day and the annual World Emoji Awards, and Emojitracker,
which provides real time visualization of all emoji symbols used on Twitter. In January 2023, Emojipedia receives approximately 44.9 million
monthly page views and has approximately 10.4 million monthly active users as of January 31, 2023 of which approximately 52% are located
in well-developed markets. It is the top resource for all things emoji, offering insights into data and cultural trends. As a voting member
of the Unicode Consortium, the standards body responsible for approving new emojis, Emojipedia works alongside major emoji creators including
Apple, Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
We believe that Emojipedia provides growth potential
to the Zedge App, and it was immediately accretive to earnings. In the past year, we have made many changes to Emojipedia including migrating
to a new ad mediation platform, redesigning the Emojipedia website, and introducing localized versions of Emojipedia in eighteen different
languages aside from English. We will continue to enhance this offering and are exploring new features including a native mobile offering
as well as additional monetization opportunities.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
or U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Form
10-K. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Critical accounting policies
are those that require application of management’s most subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently
uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Our critical accounting policies include those related to revenue recognition, business
combination, intangible assets and goodwill, capitalized software and technology development costs, and stock-based compensation. Management
bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For additional discussion of our critical accounting
policies, see our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Form 10-K.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Zedge App-MAU and ARPMAU
The presentation of our results of operations
includes disclosure of two key performance indicators - Monthly Active Users (MAU) and Average Revenue Per Monthly Active User (ARPMAU)
from our Zedge App. MAU is a key performance indicator that we define as the number of unique users that used our Zedge App during the
previous 30-day period, which is important to understanding the size of the user base for our Zedge App which is a main driver of our
revenue. Changes and trends in MAU are useful for measuring the general health of our business, gauging both present and potential users/customers’
experience, assessing the efficacy of product improvements and marketing campaigns and overall user engagement.
ARPMAU is defined as (i) the total revenue derived
from Zedge App in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAU in that same period. ARPMAU for a particular time period longer than one month
is the average ARPMAU for each month during that period. ARPMAU is valuable because it provides insight into how well we monetize our
users and, changes and trends in ARPMAU are indications of how effective our monetization investments are.
MAU decreased 11.3% in Q2 of fiscal 2023
when compared to the same period a year ago. Over the past several years, we have experienced a continuing shift in our regional
customer make-up with MAU in emerging markets representing an increasing portion of our user base. As of January 31, 2023, users in
emerging markets represented 77% of our MAU, the same percentage from a year ago. This shift impacts our business because emerging
markets do not monetize as well as well-developed markets due to lower effective cost per thousand ad impressions
(“eCPM”) and lower monthly and annual subscription sales in these regions coupled with lower priced subscriptions SKUs.
ARPMAU for the three months ended January 31, 2023 declined 13.0% when compared to the same period a year ago.
The following tables present the MAU – Zedge
App and ARPMAU – Zedge App for the three months ended January 31, 2023 as compared to the same period a year ago:

GuruShots-MAPs and ARPMAP
Monthly Active Payers (“MAPs”).
We define a MAP as a unique active user on the GuruShots or GuruShots.com in a month that completed at least one in-app purchase (“IAP”)
during that time period. MAPs for a time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate
the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution platforms.
Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (“ARPMAP”).
We define ARPMAP as (i) the total revenue from IAPs derived from GuruShots and GuruShots.com in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs
in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period.
ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP.
The following table shows our MAP and ARPMAP for
the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. Please note that we acquired GuruShots on April 12, 2022, as such, information
for the three months ended January 31, 2022 is presented below as pro forma and is only used for comparative purpose.

Our KPIs are not based on any standardized industry
methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner that other companies or third parties may use to calculate these or
similarly titled measures. The numbers that we use to calculate MAP and ARPMAP are derived from data that we generate internally. While
these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are
inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics
to improve their accuracy.

Advertising revenue .
Advertising
revenue decreased 19% and 14% in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended
January 31, 2022, primarily due to the decline in MAU in well-developed markets and lower effective advertising rates which have suffered
due to the downturn in the economy.
24
Paid subscription revenue .
We offer
users of our Zedge app a subscription option where they can pay a monthly or annual fee to remove unsolicited ads when using our Zedge
app. We employ a regional pricing strategy in order to improve conversions. The United States constitutes our largest subscriber base
and we generally charge $0.99 per month and $4.99 per year. Pricing in other markets is based on local conditions. We generated $0.8 million
and $1.7 million in gross prepaid subscription revenue in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to $0.9 million and
$1.8 million in the three and six months ended January 31, 2022. The 8% and 7% decline in gross prepaid subscription sales for the three
and six months ended January 31, 2023 when compared to the same periods a year ago was primarily attributable to the decline in MAU in
well-developed markets between the comparative periods. We expect that from time to time the prices of our subscription in each country/region
may change and we may test other plan and price variations.

value (the total sales volume transacting through the platform), or “GTV,” increased 0.9% and decreased 1.7% in the three

three and six months ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same periods a year ago. The decline in GTV and net revenue can be attributed
to the decline in MAU in well-developed markets.

Direct cost of revenues increased 85% and 94%
in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, respectively, compared to three and six months ended January 31, 2022. The increase
in the direct cost of revenues is a result of GuruShots’ infrastructure costs and the addition of analytical tools.

in the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 was 9.1%, compared to 4.9% and 5.0% in the three and six months ended January 31, 2022.
The higher percentages in the current year periods were primarily due to higher infrastructure costs related to the GuruShots.
Selling, general and administrative expense .
Selling, general and administrative expense (“SG&A”) consists mainly of payroll and benefits, stock-based compensation
expense (as discussed below), paid user acquisition expenses, third-party payment processing fee relate to in-app purchases, marketing,
consulting, professional fees, software licensing (“SaaS”), recruiting fees, facilities and public company related expenses.

the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended January 31, 2022. GuruShots
accounted for the majority of the increase. The remaining increase can be attributed to higher compensation costs resulting from additional
headcount, higher stock-based compensation as discussed below, and higher professional fees, partially offset by reductions in certain
discretionary expenses.
As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expense in
the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 were 84.1% and 84.3% respectively, compared to 44.9% and 45.1% in the three and six months
ended January 31, 2022, primarily due to the addition of GuruShots which has higher SG&A expenses relative to its revenue base.
Global headcount as of January 31, 2023 totaled
102 (including 37 from GuruShots) compared to 64 as of January 31, 2022 with the majority of our employees currently based in Lithuania
and Israel.
SG&A expense also included stock-based compensation
expense including equity grants to employees and consultants, as well as stock issuances to pay for board compensations and 401(k) matching
contributions. The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for the three and six months ended January 31, 2023 and

The increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of the restricted stock (with a grant date fair value of $4 million) issued
in connection with the GuruShots acquisition. Certain stock options, deferred stock unit and restricted stock grants are more fully described
in Note 8 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 to Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Depreciation and amortization . Depreciation
and amortization consist mainly of amortization of intangible assets in connection with business combination and asset acquisition as
more fully described in Note 5 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 to Part I of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and capitalized software and technology development costs of our internal developers on various projects
that we invested in specific to the various platforms on which we operate our service.

The Company’s tax provision or benefit from
income taxes for interim periods has generally been determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income
and records the discrete tax items in the period to which they relate. In each quarter, the Company updates the estimated annual effective
tax rate and makes a year-to-date adjustment to the tax provision as necessary.
The Company’s annual effective tax rate
for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2023 differs from the United States federal statutory tax rate due to certain factors with temporary
differences primarily related to equity compensation expenses.
As of January 31, 2023, the Company had $3.5 million
of deferred tax assets for which it has established a valuation allowance of $1.9 million, related to U.S. federal and state taxes and
for a certain international subsidiary.
The Company is subject to taxation in the United
States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Earnings from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax. The material jurisdictions
where the Company is subject to potential examination by tax authorities include the United States, Norway, Lithuania and Israel.

For the three and six months ended January 31,
2023, our income from operations related to the Zedge App decreased 50% and 49%, compared to the three and six months ended January 31,
2022 primarily due to lower revenue coupled with higher operating expenses. The decline in revenue was largely due to the decrease in
MAU, particularly in well-developed markets. Higher operating expenses can be attributed to additional headcounts as well as our investment
in the paid user acquisition in Zedge App.
For the three and six months ended January 31,
2023, our loss from operations related to the GuruShots was $1.9 million and $3.5 million, respectively, primarily due to lower revenue
coupled with higher operating expenses. Lower revenue can be attributed to current macroeconomic condition which resulted in lower MAP
and ARPMAP when compared to prior periods.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
At January 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents
of $17.5 million and working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $14.2 million, compared to $17.1 million and $11.2 million,
respectively, at July 31, 2022. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and our cash flow from operations will be sufficient
to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the twelve-month period ending March 17, 2024. We also maintain a term loan and a revolving
credit facility of up to $11 million in aggregate, including a foreign exchange contract facility of up to $6.5 million with Western Alliance
Bank, as discussed below in Financing Activities and in Note 11 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included
in Item 1 to Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Operating Activities
Our cash flow from operations varies significantly
from quarter to quarter and from year to year, depending on our operating results and the timing of operating cash receipts and payments,
specifically trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $4.6 million in the
six months ended January 31, 2023 to $1.1 million from $5.7 million in the six months ended January 31, 2022, primarily attributable to
the net loss incurred in the current year period.
28
Changes in Trade Accounts Receivable
Gross trade accounts receivable increased $0.4
million to $2.8 million at January 31, 2023 from $2.4 million at July 31, 2022, primarily due to higher revenue in the preceding two months
ended January 31, 2023 when compared to the same period ended July 31, 2022.
Investing Activities
On April 12, 2022, we acquired 100% of the outstanding
equity securities of GuruShots. The purchase price consists of $18 million in cash paid at closing and contingent payments (the “Earnout”)
of up to a maximum of $16.8 million, payable either in cash or Class B common stock of the Company or a combination thereof (in the Company’s
discretion) payable over two years from closing subject to GuruShots achieving certain financial targets set forth in the Share Purchase
Agreement (“SPA”). In connection therewith, we agreed to make certain minimum investments in user acquisition for GuruShots
in the period covered by the Earnout, subject to GuruShots maintaining agreed upon levels of return on ad spend (ROAS). In addition, we
committed to a retention pool of $4 million in cash and 626,242 shares of the Company Class B common stock with a fair value of $4 million
or $6.39 per share for GuruShots’ founders and other employees that will be payable or vest, as applicable, over three years from
April 1, 2022 based on the beneficiaries thereof remaining employed by the Company or a subsidiary.
On August 1, 2021, we acquired substantially all
of the assets of Emojipedia Pty Ltd, a proprietary company organized under the laws of Australia. The final purchase price of the assets
was determined to be $6.7 million of which $4.8 million was paid on August 2, 2021 with the remaining $1.9 million to be paid out on the
six-month and twelve-month anniversary of the Closing. We paid approximately half of the $1.9 million on February 1, 2022 and the remaining
amount was paid on August 1, 2022.
Business combination and assets acquisition are
more fully described in Note 5 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 to Part I of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Cash used in investing activities in the fiscal
years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 also consisted of capitalized software and technology development costs related to various projects
that we invested in specific to the various platforms on which we operate our service.
Financing Activities
On October 28, 2022, we entered into an Amended
Loan Agreement with Western Alliance Bank. Pursuant to the Amended Loan Agreement, Western Alliance Bank agreed to provide the Company
with a new term loan facility in the maximum principal amount of $7 million for a four-year term and a $4 million revolving credit facility
for a two-year term.
The Company discontinued the existing $2 million
revolving credit facility under the existing Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of September 26, 2016, please see Note 11 to the unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 to Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As of July 31,
2022 and the time of the discontinuance, there was no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility.
Pursuant to the Amended Loan Agreement, $2 million
was advanced in a single-cash advance on October 28, 2022, with the remaining $5 million available for drawdown during twenty-four (24)
months after closing. Each drawdown must be in an amount of not less than $1 million.
In the three and six months ended January 31,
2023 and 2022, we purchased 6,310 shares and 16,115 shares, respectively, of Class B common stock from employees for $17,000 and $232,000
respectively, to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock and DSUs. In connection with the
share repurchase program as discussed below, we bought back 442,000 shares for approximately $972,000 in the six months ended January
31, 2023, including commission and banking fees of approximately $11 thousand.
We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common
stock until we achieve sustainable profitability and retain certain minimum cash reserves. The payment of dividends in any specific period
will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant
Customers
Historically, we have had very little or no bad
debt, which is common with other platforms of our size that derive their revenue from mobile advertising, as we aggressively manage our
collections and perform due diligence on our customers. In addition, the majority of our revenue is derived from large, credit-worthy
customers, e.g. Google, Facebook, and AppLovin, and we terminate our services with smaller customers immediately upon balances becoming
past due. Since these smaller customers rely on us to derive their own revenue, they generally pay their outstanding balances on a timely
basis.
In the six months ended January 31, 2023, three
customers represented 24%, 19% and 10% of our revenue. In the six months ended January 31, 2022, three customers represented 25%, 23%
and 12% of our revenue. At January 31, 2023, three customers represented 29%, 25% and 10% of our accounts receivable balance. At July
31, 2022, three customers represented 47%, 17% and 16% of our accounts receivable balance. All of these significant customers were advertising
exchanges operated by leading companies, and the receivables represent many smaller amounts due from their advertisers.
Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial
Commitments
Smaller reporting companies are not required to
provide the information required by this item.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At January 31, 2023, we did not have any “off-balance
sheet arrangements,” as defined in relevant SEC regulations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risks
Smaller reporting companies are not required to
provide the information required by this item.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures .
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2023.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting .
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 31,
2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Legal proceedings in which we are involved are
more fully described in Note 10 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 to Part I of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Other than the additional risk factor disclosed
below, there are no other material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A to Part I of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022.
The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank may impact certain of our
customers’ ability to pay money owed to the Company.
On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”)
was shut down, followed by Signature Bank on March 12, 2023, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) was appointed
as receiver. Although the Company does not have any deposits at either bank, some of our current and potential advertisers and other counterparties,
might have deposits with them, which may expose us to potential risks that could impact our financial position and operations.  Any
issues that may arise with our customers’ deposits at Silicon Valley Bank could have ripple effects that may impact our customers'
ability to pay their current and/or future debts owed to the Company.
The failure of SVB may lead to advertisers defaulting
on their obligations to the Company, which could impact our revenue and cash flows.  Furthermore, some of our vendors may be impacted
by the SVB collapse. The failure of SVB may cause vendors to face financial difficulties, which could lead to a delay or inability to
deliver goods and services to the Company.
Despite the steps taken to date by U.S. agencies
to protect depositors, the follow-on effects of the events surrounding the SVB collapse are unknown, could include failures of other financial
institutions to which we face direct or more significant exposure, and may lead to significant disruptions to our operations, financial
position, and reputation.  The extent of such impacts is uncertain, and there may be greater risks that we have not yet identified.
We are taking steps to identify any potential impact and minimize any disruptions to our operations.  However, we cannot guarantee
that we will be able to avoid any negative consequences directly or indirectly from the SVB collapse.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
Proceeds
Sales of Unregistered Securities
During the six months ended January 31, 2023, we issued
29,820 shares of our Class B common stock upon the vesting and settlement of DSUs issued under our 2016 Incentive Plan.
The foregoing issuances did not involve any underwriters,
any underwriting discounts or commissions, and were covered by a Registration Statement on Form S-8 filed by the Company with the Securities
and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”).

our Class B common stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions,
subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur
in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b-5 trading plans to facilitate
repurchases of its shares. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our Class B common stock, has
no expiration date and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time at our discretion.
