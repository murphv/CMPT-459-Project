7 Table of Contents    CENTURY COBALT CORP. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAY 31, 2022 (Unaudited)   NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS   Century Cobalt Corp. (formerly First American Silver Corp.) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on April 29, 2008. The Company’s principal office is located at 10100 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 300, Century City, California 90067. The Company’s principal business activity is the identification and exploration of mineral properties for the purposes of discovering economical cobalt assets.   NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of Presentation   The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars.   These consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary Century Cobalt Limited (“CCL”), a United Kingdom public company. CCL was formed to hold the equity investment with Technology Metals, PLC, a related party. All intercompany balance between the Company and CCL are eliminated in consolidation. Also included within the accompanying financial statements are the Company’s unconsolidated equity investment with Technology Metals, PLC, a related party, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. See
Note 4 - Emperium Sale and Equity Method Investment
for a further discussion.   Accounting Basis   The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP” accounting). The Company has adopted a November 30 fiscal year end.   Risks and Uncertainties   The Company’s operations are subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, technological, and regulatory risks including the potential risk of business failure. See Note 3 regarding going concern matters.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At May 31, 2022 and November 30, 2021, respectively, the Company had $ 87,593
and $ 26,654
of unrestricted cash to be used for future business operations.   The Company’s bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to $ 250,000 . At times, the Company’s bank deposits may exceed the insured amount. Management believes it has little risk related to the excess deposits.   Prepaid Expenses   The Company considers all items incurred for future services to be prepaid expenses. At May 31, 2022 and November 30, 2021, respectively, the Company’s prepaid balance was $ 6,886
and $- 0 - consisting of prepaid interest on a note payable.   Equity Method for Investments   The equity method is an accounting technique used by the Company to record the profits earned or losses through its investment in another company. With the equity method of accounting, the Company reports the income or loss by the other company on its income statement, in an amount proportional to the percentage of its equity investment in the other company. The equity method is used to value a company’s investment in another company when it holds significant influence over the company it is investing in. The threshold for “significant influence” is commonly a 20-50% ownership. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at historical cost, and adjustments are made to the value based on the investor’s percentage ownership in net income, loss, and dividend payouts. Net income of the investee company increases the Company’s value on the balance sheet, while the investee’s loss or dividend payout decreases it.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   Fair value of certain of the Company’s financial instruments including cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, notes payable, and other accrued liabilities approximate cost because of their short maturities. The Company measures and reports fair value in accordance with ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure” defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value investments.   Fair value, as defined in ASC 820, is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of an asset should reflect its highest and best use by market participants, principal (or most advantageous) markets, and an in-use or an in-exchange valuation premise. The fair value of a liability should reflect the risk of nonperformance, which includes, among other things, the Company’s credit risk.   Valuation techniques are generally classified into three categories: the market approach; the income approach; and the cost approach. The selection and application of one or more of the techniques may require significant judgment and are primarily dependent upon the characteristics of the asset or liability, and the quality and availability of inputs. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under ASC 820 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ASC 820 also provides fair value hierarchy for inputs and resulting measurement as follows:     8 Table of Contents   Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities.   Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and   Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are supported by little or no market activity, and that are significant to the fair values.   Fair value measurements are required to be disclosed by the Level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall. Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (in Level 3 measurements) are subject to expanded disclosure requirements including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances, separately presenting changes during the period attributable to the following: (i) total gains or losses for the period (realized and unrealized), segregating those gains or losses included in earnings, and a description of where those gains or losses included in earning are reported in the statement of income. All assets and liabilities of the Company approximate fair value.   Valuation of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets   We assess the impairment of long-lived assets periodically, or at least annually, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors considered important, which could trigger an impairment review, include the following: significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future cash flows; significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy of the overall business; and significant negative industry trends. When management determines that the carrying value of long-lived and intangible assets may not be recoverable, impairment is measured as the excess of the assets’ carrying value over the estimated fair value. Management is not aware of any impairment changes that may currently be required; however, we cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported values in the future.   Concentrations of Credit Risk   The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, the balances of which at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company continually monitors its banking relationships and consequently has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.   Stock-Based Compensation   The Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 718. The scope of Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, includes share-based payments issued to employees and nonemployees for goods and services. The Company issues restricted stock to employees and consultants for their services. Cost for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments issued at the date of grant. These shares are considered fully vested and the fair market value is recognized as expense in the period granted. The Company recognized consulting expenses and a corresponding increase to additional paid-in-capital related to stock issued for services. For agreements requiring future services, the consulting expense is to be recognized ratably over the requisite service period.   Total stock-based compensation amounted to $ 2,170
and $ 43,645
for the three months ended May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 2,170
and $ 46,510
for the six months ended May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.   Income Taxes   The Company’s policy is to provide for deferred income taxes based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) legislation reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to
21.0 % and is effective June 22, 2018 for the Company. We did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception.  When it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit.  We provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset, consisting of net operating loss carryforwards, because management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carryforward period.   The Company is not aware of any uncertain tax position that, if challenged, would have a material effect on the financial statements for the six months ended May 31, 2022, or during the prior three years applicable under FASB ASC 740.  We did not recognize any adjustment to the liability for uncertain tax position and therefore did not record any adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company is in the process of filing all unfiled tax returns. All tax returns for the Company remain open for examination.    Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Revenue Recognition   Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that an entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.     9 Table of Contents   Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, the Company’s performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon delivery.   Basic Income (Loss) Per Share   Basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. The convertible debt to common shares and unissued stock earned could potentially amount to approximately
2,888,000
additional shares issued by the Company. The Company’s convertible notes, and unissued shares are included from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended May 31, 2022 due to the reported net income.  The Company’s convertible notes, and unissued shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as they are anti-dilutive due to the Company’s losses for the three months ended May 31, 2022 and 2021 and the nine months ended May 31, 2021.   Foreign Currency Translation   The functional and presentation currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are recorded on the initial recognition at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency with any related gain or loss recorded in earnings. The Company translates assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency foreign transactions into the U.S. dollar reporting currency at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The Company translates income and expense items of such foreign transactions into the U.S. dollar reporting currency at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 ,
Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)-Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. For convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815,
Derivatives and Hedging , or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, the embedded conversion features no longer are separated from the host contract. ASU 2020-06 also removes certain conditions that should be considered in the derivatives scope exception evaluation under Subtopic 815-40,
Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity , and clarify the scope and certain requirements under Subtopic 815-40. In addition, ASU 2020-06 improves the guidance related to the disclosures and earnings-per-share (EPS) for convertible instruments and contract in entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 is effective for public business entities that meet the definition of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Board specified that an entity should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluation the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.   Management believes recently no other issued accounting pronouncements will have an impact on the financial statements of the Company.   Mineral Properties   Costs of exploration are expensed as incurred. Mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized including licenses and lease payments. Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, these procedures do not guarantee the Company’s title. Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers and title may be affected by undetected defects.   Mineral properties are analyzed for impairment on an annual basis, or more often if warranted by circumstances. Impairment losses are recorded on mineral properties used in operations when indicators of impairment are present.   Capitalization   Only assets with a cost over $ 5,000
and a useful life of over 1 year are capitalized. All other costs are expensed in the period incurred.   Reclassifications   Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform to the current-year financial statement presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations.   NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Century Cobalt Corp., Inc. will continue as a going concern. The Company has a working capital deficit, has not yet received revenue from sales of products or services, and has incurred losses from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Without realization of additional debt or capital, it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.   The Company’s activities to date have been supported by debt and equity financing. It has sustained losses in all previous reporting periods with an inception to date loss of $ 4,919,291
as of May 31, 2022. Management continues to seek funding from its shareholders and other qualified investors.      10 Table of Contents   NOTE 4 - SALE OF EMPERIUM AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT   On September 14, 2021, the Company signed a share purchase agreement to sell the assets of Emperium 1 Holdings Corp (“Emperium”) and repay a related party receivable to Technology Minerals PLC (“TM PLC”), a related party.

As Mayetok, Inc. we were engaged in the development of a website to market vacation properties in the Ukraine.   On June 8, 2010, we initiated a one (1) old for 35 new forward stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital increased from 100,000,000 to 3,500,000,000 shares of common stock and the issued and outstanding increased from 2,200,000 shares of common stock to 77,000,000 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001.   Also, on June 8, 2010, we changed our name from “Mayetok, Inc.” to “First American Silver Corp.”, by way of a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary First American Silver Corp., which was formed solely for the change of name. We changed the name of our company to reflect the new direction of our company in the business of acquiring, exploring and developing mineral properties. As of June 2010, we had abandoned our former business plan of seeking to market vacation properties.   Our name change and forward stock split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on June 16, 2010, on which date we adopted the new stock symbol “FASV”.   On June 18, 2018, we changed our name from “First American Silver Corp.” to “Century Cobalt Corp”, by way of a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary Century Cobalt Corp., which was formed solely for the change of name. We changed the name of our company to reflect the new direction of our company in the business of acquiring, exploring and developing mineral properties. Our name change became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on June 18, 2018, on which date we adopted the new stock symbol “CCOB”   Our Current Business   On August 7, 2018, we entered into an assignment agreement with Oriental Rainbow Group Ltd., in regards to the acquisition of certain mineral claims in Lemhi County, Idaho known as the “Idaho Cobalt Belt”.   Oriental Rainbow and Plateau Ventures LLC had entered into a purchase agreement dated September 4, 2017, wherein Oriental Rainbow had acquired from Plateau a 100% interest in the property, subject to certain subsequent payments and conditions. The claims comprising the property (649 claims) initially totaled approximately 12,980 acres, subject to an option under the purchase agreement for the acquisition of additional claims. Such option had been exercised with additional claims acquired, resulting in a total of 695 claims comprising approximately 13,900 acres.   Oriental Rainbow has assigned its interest in the property to us in consideration for 2,500,000 restricted shares of common stock (the “Consideration Shares”). We have assumed all of Oriental Rainbow’s obligations under the purchase agreement, which material obligations include: the issuance of up to 500,000 restricted shares of common stock to Plateau upon listing on a recognized stock exchange; paying pending BLM fees for the claims in the amount of $108,000; and paying Plateau $1,000,000 in four equal staged payments upon completion of a positive feasibility study on the property.   Century Cobalt’s, acreage, known as the “Emperium Cobalt Project,” as noted above totals 12,980 Acres / 5,625 Hectares, making it larger than the combined land claims of the 5 largest publicly traded companies currently active in the Idaho Cobalt Belt. The project is located approximately 16 miles (26 km) southwest of Salmon, Idaho. As of March 2020, the Company’s land position has been reduced to 694 claims.   We had been exploring further options regarding the monetization of its Emperium Cobalt Project, which may include the sub-licensing or sale of the assets. Further to these efforts, on March 17, 2021, we signed an MOU and entered into discussions with UK-based Technology Minerals Limited (“Technology Minerals”) for Technology Minerals to acquire the Company’s entire interest (“the assets”) in the Emperium Cobalt Project.   Technology Minerals is comprised of mining assets and a major recycling group, laying the foundations for the UK’s first meaningful green circular economy in the battery industry and is currently in the process of becoming a UK-listed Company on the Standard List of the London Stock Exchange, by way of a Reverse Take Over.   Technology Minerals will extract the raw materials required for Li-ion Battery cathodes and then help solve the ecological issue of spent Li-ion batteries by recycling them for reuse by battery manufacturers.   On September 14, 2021, the Company signed a share purchase agreement to sell the assets of Emperium 1 Holdings Corp to Technology Minerals PLC, a related party. Technology Minerals PLC become new UK public company during the three months ended August 31, 2021. The Company was issued 420,000,000 unregistered shares (0.001£ par value) of Technology Minerals PLC common stock. The Company initially owned approximately 38.8% of the outstanding shares of Technology Minerals PLC.  At May 31, 2022, the owns approximately 37.5% of the outstanding shares of Technology Minerals PLC.   We are currently accessing the next steps our business.     16 Table of Contents   Results of Operations   For the three months ended May 31, 2022 Compared to the three months ended May 31, 2021   Revenue   We have not earned any revenues since our inception, and we do not anticipate earning revenues in the upcoming quarter.   Net income (loss)   We had a net income of $52,810 for the three-month period ended May 31, 2022 which was $248,061 higher than the net loss of $195,251 for the three-month period ended May 31, 2021.
