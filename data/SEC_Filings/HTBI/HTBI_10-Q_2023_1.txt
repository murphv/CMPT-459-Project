AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements presented in this report include the accounts of HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("HomeTrust"), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, HomeTrust Bank (the "Bank"). As used throughout this report, the term the "Company" refers to HomeTrust and the Bank, its consolidated subsidiary, unless the context otherwise requires. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X as promulgated by the SEC. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have been included. It is recommended that these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
June 30, 2022
("2022 Form 10-K") filed with the SEC on September 12, 2022. The results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Various elements of the Company's accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions, and other subjective assessments. In particular, management has identified the determination of the provision and the ACL on loans as an accounting policy that, due to the judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in this policy, is critical to an understanding of the Company's financial statements. This policy and the related judgments, estimates and assumptions is described in greater detail in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Critical Accounting Policies) in the 2022 Form 10-K. Management believes that the judgments, estimates, and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate based on the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of the financial statements to this critical accounting policy, the use of other judgments, estimates, and assumptions could result in material differences in the Company's results of operations or financial condition. Further, subsequent changes in economic or market conditions could have a material impact on this estimate and the Company's financial condition and operating results in future periods. Reclassifications To maintain consistency and comparability, certain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation with no effect on net income or stockholders’ equity as previously reported. Loans Held for Sale Residential mortgages originated and intended for sale in the secondary market through mandatory delivery contracts are recorded at fair value (fair value option elected). The fair value includes the servicing value of the loans as well as any accrued interest, with changes in value recorded through the gain on sale of loans held for sale. Conversely, residential mortgages originated and intended for sale in the secondary market on a best efforts basis are sold with servicing released and carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by outstanding commitments from investors. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and charged to earnings. The Company originates loans guaranteed by the SBA for the purchase of businesses, business startups, business expansion, equipment, and working capital. All SBA loans are underwritten and documented as prescribed by the SBA. SBA loans are generally fully amortizing and have maturity dates and amortizations of up to
25
years. SBA loans are classified as held for sale and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. The guaranteed portion of the loan is sold and the servicing rights are retained. A gain is recorded for any premium received in excess of the carrying value of the net assets transferred in the sale and is included in the gain on sale of loans held for sale. The portion of SBA loans that are retained are adjusted to fair value and reclassified to total loans, net of deferred costs (loans held for investment). The net value of the retained loans is included in the appropriate loan classification for disclosure purposes.
HELOCs held for sale are originated through a third party in various states outside the Company's geographic footprint, but are underwritten to the Company's underwriting guidelines. The loans are generally held for sale by the Company over a 90 to 180 day period and are serviced by the third party. The loans are marketed by the third party to investors in pools and once sold the Company recognizes a gain or loss on the sale which is recorded through the gain on sale of loans held for sale. Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company holds and issues derivative financial instruments such as IRLCs and other forward sale commitments. IRLCs are subject to pricing risk primarily related to fluctuations in market interest rates. To hedge the interest rate risk on certain IRLCs, the Company uses forward sale commitments such as TBAs or mandatory delivery commitments with investors. Management expects these forward sale commitments to experience changes in fair value opposite to the changes in fair value of the IRLCs, thereby reducing earnings volatility. Forward sale commitments are also used to hedge the interest rate risk on mortgage loans held for sale that are not committed to investors and still subject to price risk. If the mandatory delivery commitments are not fulfilled, the Company pays a pair-off fee. Best effort forward sale commitments are also executed with investors, whereby certain loans are locked with a borrower and simultaneously committed to an investor at a fixed price. If the best effort IRLC does not fund, there is no obligation to fulfill the investor commitment. The Company considers various factors and strategies in determining what portion of the IRLCs and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale to economically hedge. All derivative instruments are recognized as other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments and gains and losses resulting from the pairing- 10 HOMETRUST BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) out of forward sale commitments are recognized in the gain on sale of loans held for sale on the consolidated statements of income in the period in which they occur. The Company accounts for all derivative instruments as free-standing derivative instruments and does not designate any for hedge accounting. 2.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements Newly Issued but Not Yet Effective Accounting Standards ASU 2022-02, "Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures."
This ASU eliminates the TDR recognition and measurement guidance and requires that an entity evaluate whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. The amendment also adjusts the disclosures related to modifications and requires entities to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination within the existing vintage disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 3.     Debt Securities Debt securities available for sale consist of the following at the dates indicated: December 31, 2022 Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Estimated Fair Value U.S. government agencies $ 15,998   $ —   $ ( 599 ) $ 15,399   MBS, residential 87,007   9   ( 2,569 ) 84,447   Municipal bonds 4,522   1   ( 114 ) 4,409   Corporate bonds 45,263   —   ( 1,576 ) 43,687   Total $ 152,790   $ 10   $ ( 4,858 ) $ 147,942   June 30, 2022 Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Estimated Fair Value U.S. government agencies $ 18,993   $ 5   $ ( 539 ) $ 18,459   MBS, residential 48,377   3   ( 1,147 ) 47,233   Municipal bonds 5,545   31   ( 18 ) 5,558   Corporate bonds 57,184   1   ( 1,457 ) 55,728   Total $ 130,099   $ 40   $ ( 3,161 ) $ 126,978   Debt securities available for sale by contractual maturity at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 are shown below. MBS are not included in the maturity categories because the borrowers in the underlying pools may prepay without penalty; therefore, it is unlikely that the securities will pay at their stated maturity schedule.   December 31, 2022 Amortized Cost Estimated Fair Value Due within one year $ 42,262   $ 41,448   Due after one year through five years 18,006   17,060   Due after five years through ten years 5,515   4,987   Due after ten years —   —   MBS, residential 87,007   84,447   Total $ 152,790   $ 147,942     June 30, 2022 Amortized Cost Estimated Fair Value Due within one year $ 35,350   $ 34,956   Due after one year through five years 40,325   39,018   Due after five years through ten years 6,047   5,771   Due after ten years —   —   MBS, residential 48,377   47,233   Total $ 130,099   $ 126,978   The Company had

195
and
177 , respectively. Management evaluates securities for impairment where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. All debt securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2022 continue to perform as scheduled and management does not believe that there is a credit loss or that a provision for credit losses is necessary. Also, as part of management's evaluation of its intent and ability to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market, management considers its investment strategy, cash flow needs, liquidity position, capital adequacy and interest rate risk position. Management does not currently intend to sell the securities within the portfolio and it is not more-likely-than-not that securities will be required to be sold. See "Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in our 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion. Management continues to monitor all of its securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that management will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of its securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods. Management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on investment securities and does not record an ACL on accrued interest receivable. As of December 31, 2022, the accrued interest receivable for debt securities available for sale was $ 552 . 4.     Loans Held For Sale Loans held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value, consist of the following as of the dates indicated: December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 One-to-four family $ 26   $ 4,176   SBA 37,375   14,774   HELOCs 35,376   60,357   Total loans held for sale, at the lower of cost or fair value $ 72,777   $ 79,307   The carrying balance of loans held for sale, at fair value, was $ 518

All qualifying one-to-four family first mortgage loans, HELOCs, commercial real estate loans, indirect auto, municipal leases and FHLB of Atlanta stock are pledged as collateral by a blanket pledge to secure any outstanding FHLB and FRB advances. Loans are monitored for credit quality on a recurring basis and the composition of the loans outstanding by credit quality indicator is provided below. Loan credit quality indicators are developed through review of individual borrowers on an ongoing basis. Generally, loans are monitored for performance on a quarterly basis with the credit quality indicators adjusted as needed. The indicators represent the rating for loans as of the date presented based on the most recent assessment performed. These credit quality indicators are defined as follows: Pass —A pass rated asset is not adversely classified because it does not display any of the characteristics for adverse classification. Special Mention —A special mention asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, such potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not warrant adverse classification. Substandard —A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor, or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets classified as substandard generally have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. These assets are characterized by the distinct possibility of loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful —An asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in an asset classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values. Loss —Assets classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuing to be carried as an asset is not warranted. This classification is not necessarily equivalent to no potential for recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not appropriate to defer a full write-off even though partial recovery may be effected in the future. 13 HOMETRUST BANCSHARES, INC.

The Company does not typically forgive principal when restructuring troubled debt. In determining the ACL, management considers TDRs for all loan classes, and the subsequent nonperformance in accordance with their modified terms, by measuring a reserve on a loan-by-loan basis based on either the value of the loan's expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate or on the collateral value, net of the estimated costs of disposal, if the loan is collateral dependent. 25 HOMETRUST BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposure The Company maintains a separate reserve for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The reserve for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of ECLs on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, utilizing the same models and approaches for the Company's other loan portfolio segments described above, as these unfunded commitments share similar risk characteristics as its loan portfolio segments. The Company has identified the unfunded portion of certain lines of credit as unconditionally cancellable credit exposures, meaning the Company can cancel the unfunded commitment at any time. No credit loss estimate is reported for off-balance-sheet credit exposures that are unconditionally cancellable by the Company or for undrawn amounts under such arrangements that may be drawn prior to the cancellation of the arrangement. At December 31, 2022 and
June 30, 2022 , the ACL on off-balance-sheet credit exposures included in other liabilities was $ 3,662
and $ 3,304 , respectively. 6.     Leases As Lessee - Operating Leases The Company's operating leases primarily include office space and bank branches. Certain leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term up to
15  additional years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at management's sole discretion. When it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise its option to renew or extend the lease term, that option is included in estimating the value of the ROU and lease liability. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Most of the Company's lease agreements include periodic rate adjustments for inflation. The depreciable life of ROU assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the shorter of the useful life or the expected lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company recognizes lease expenses for these leases over the lease term. The following table presents supplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases. ROU assets are included in other assets and lease liabilities are included in other liabilities.

The Company's equipment finance leases consist mainly of construction, transportation, healthcare, and manufacturing equipment. Many of its operating and finance leases offer the lessee the option to purchase the equipment at fair value or for a nominal fixed purchase option; and most of the leases that do not have a nominal purchase option include renewal provisions resulting in some leases continuing beyond initial contractual terms. The Company's leases do not include early termination options, and continued rent payments are due if leased equipment is not returned at the end of the lease. As Lessor - Operating Leases Operating lease income is recognized as a component of noninterest income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease terms range from
one
to
five years . Assets related to operating leases are included in other assets and the corresponding depreciation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis as a component of other noninterest expense. The net book value of leased assets totaled $ 20,047

On November 14, 2022, at the Company's annual meeting, stockholders approved the 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan which provides for the same types of awards as described under the
2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Going forward, any future grants will be made under this plan. The cost of equity-based awards under the 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan generally is based on the fair value of the awards on their grant date. The maximum number of shares that may be utilized for awards under the plan is
1,000,000 . Shares of common stock issued under the plan will be issued out of authorized but unissued shares, some or all of which may be repurchased shares.

– Legally binding commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. In the normal course of business, there are various outstanding commitments to extend credit that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, loan commitments (excluding $ 272,250
and $ 312,893
of undisbursed portions of construction loans) totaled $ 90,214
and $ 104,745
of which $ 11,604
and $ 23,159
were variable rate commitments and $ 78,610
and $ 81,586
were fixed rate commitments. The fixed rate loan commitments had interest rates ranging from
1.41 % to
9.44 % at December 31, 2022 and
1.41 % to
9.00 % at June 30, 2022, and terms ranging from
three
to
30
years. Pre-approved but unused lines of credit (principally second mortgage home equity loans and overdraft protection loans) totaled $ 540,370
and $ 485,239
at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. These amounts represent the Company's exposure to credit risk, and in the opinion of management have no more than the normal lending risk that the Company commits to its borrowers. The Company has two types of commitments related to certain one-to-four family loans held for sale: rate lock commitments and forward loan commitments. Rate lock commitments are commitments to extend credit to a customer that has an interest rate lock and are considered derivative instruments. The rate lock commitments do not qualify for hedge accounting. In order to mitigate the risk from interest rate fluctuations, the Company enters into forward loan sale commitments such as TBAs, mandatory delivery commitments with investors, or best efforts forward sale commitments with investors. The fair value of these interest rate lock commitments was not material at December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022. The Company grants construction and permanent loans collateralized primarily by residential and commercial real estate to customers throughout its primary market areas. In addition, the Company grants equipment financing throughout the United States and municipal financing to customers throughout North and South Carolina. The Company’s loan portfolio can be affected by the general economic conditions within these market areas. Management believes that the Company has no significant concentration of credit in the loan portfolio. Restrictions on Cash
– In response to COVID-19, the FRB reduced the reserve requirements to zero on March 15, 2020. Prior to this change the Bank was required by regulation to maintain a varying cash reserve balance with the FRB.  Guarantees
– Standby letters of credit obligate the Company to meet certain financial obligations of its customers, if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the customers are unable to do so. The financial standby letters of credit issued by the Company are irrevocable and payment is only guaranteed upon the borrower's failure to perform its obligations to the beneficiary. Total commitments under standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 were $ 19,997
and $ 18,362 , respectively. There was no liability recorded for these letters of credit at December 31, 2022 or June 30, 2022. Litigation
–   From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested, and the outcome of individual matters is not always predictable. These claims and counter claims typically arise during the course of collection efforts on problem loans or with respect to actions to enforce liens on properties in which the Company holds a security interest. The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that management believes would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations . 10.     Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1:    Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2:    Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3:    Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets recorded at fair value. The Company does not have any liabilities recorded at fair value. The methods of determining the fair value of assets and liabilities presented in this note are consistent with the methodologies disclosed in Note 19 of the 2022 Form 10-K. 30 HOMETRUST BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Financial Assets Recorded at Fair Value The following table presents financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the dates indicated: December 31, 2022 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Debt securities available for sale U.S government agencies $ 15,399   $ —   $ 15,399   $ —   MBS, residential 84,447   —   84,447   —   Municipal bonds 4,409   —   4,409   —   Corporate bonds 43,687   —   43,687   —   Total debt securities available for sale $ 147,942   $ —   $ 147,942   $ —   Loans held for sale $ 518   $ —   $ 518   $ —   June 30, 2022 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Debt securities available for sale U.S government agencies $ 18,459   $ —   $ 18,459   $ —   MBS, residential 47,233   —   47,233   —   Municipal bonds 5,558   —   5,558   —   Corporate bonds 55,728   —   55,728   —   Total debt securities available for sale $ 126,978   $ —   $ 126,978   $ —   Loans held for sale carried at fair value are valued at the individual loan level using quoted secondary market prices. There were no transfers between levels during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The following table presents financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at the dates indicated: December 31, 2022 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Collateral dependent loans Commercial loans Commercial and industrial $ 169   $ —   $ —   $ 169   June 30, 2022 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Collateral dependent loans Commercial loans Commercial and industrial $ 415   $ —   $ —   $ 415   A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based on current information and events, the Company expects repayment of the financial assets to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the Company has determined that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty as of the measurement date. For real estate loans, the fair value of the loan's collateral is determined by a third party appraisal, which is then adjusted for the estimated selling and closing costs related to liquidation of the collateral (typically ranging from
8 % to
12 % of the appraised value). For this asset class, the actual valuation methods (income, sales comparable, or cost) vary based on the status of the project or property. Additional discounts of
5 % to
15 % may be applied depending on the age of the appraisals. The unobservable inputs may vary depending on the individual asset with no one of the three methods being the predominant approach. For non-real estate loans, the fair value of the loan's collateral may be determined using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower's financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management's historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management's expertise and knowledge of the customer and customer's business. 31 HOMETRUST BANCSHARES, INC.

Since these commitments are based on current rates, the carrying amount approximates the fair value. 32 Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In November 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to Regulation S-K to eliminate certain disclosure requirements and to revise several others to make the disclosures provided in the management's discussion and analysis section more useful for investors. When providing a discussion and analysis of interim period results, the amendments provide a registrant with the option to discuss its interim results by comparing its most recent quarter to the immediately preceding quarter rather than to the same quarter of the prior year. The Company elected to exercise this option as it believes that the comparison of current quarter results to a linked quarter, rather than the prior year comparable quarter, more accurately reflects management's perspective of the organization and its results. Forward-Looking Statements Certain matters in this Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance or business. Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical fact, but instead are based on certain assumptions and are generally identified by use of the words "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "targets," "potentially," "probably," "projects," "outlook" or similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as "may," "will," "should," "would," and "could." Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, assumptions, and statements about future economic performance and projections of financial items. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated or implied by our forward-looking statements.

• expected revenues, cost savings, synergies and other benefits from our merger and acquisition activities, including the proposed acquisition of Quantum Capital Corp., might not be realized to the extent anticipated, within the anticipated time frames, or at all, and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention, might be greater than expected; • the credit risks of lending activities, including changes in the level and trend of loan delinquencies and write offs and changes in our allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses that may be impacted by deterioration in the housing and commercial real estate markets; • changes in general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas; • changes in the levels of general interest rates, and the relative differences between short and long term interest rates, deposit interest rates, our net interest margin and funding sources and the effects of inflation or a potential recession; • uncertainty regarding the limited future of LIBOR, and the expected transition toward new interest rate benchmarks; • fluctuations in the demand for loans, the number of unsold homes, land and other properties and fluctuations in real estate values in our market areas; • decreases in the secondary market for the sale of loans that we originate; • results of examinations of us by the Federal Reserve, the NCCOB, or other regulatory authorities, including the possibility that any such regulatory authority may, among other things, require us to increase our allowance for credit losses, write-down assets, change our regulatory capital position or affect our ability to borrow funds or maintain or increase deposits, which could adversely affect our liquidity and earnings; • legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect our business including the effect of Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, changes in laws or regulations, changes in regulatory policies and principles or the application or interpretation of laws and regulations by regulatory agencies and tax authorities, including changes in deferred tax asset and liability activity, or the interpretation of regulatory capital or other rules, including as a result of Basel III; • our ability to attract and retain deposits; • management's assumptions in determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; • our ability to control operating costs and expenses, especially costs associated with our operation as a public company; • the use of estimates in determining fair value of certain assets, which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuation; • difficulties in reducing risks associated with the loans on our balance sheet; • staffing fluctuations in response to product demand or the implementation of corporate strategies that affect our workforce and potential associated charges; • disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, our information technology systems or on the third-party vendors who perform several of our critical processing functions; • our ability to retain key members of our senior management team; • costs and effects of litigation, including settlements and judgments; • our ability to successfully integrate any assets, liabilities, customers, systems, and management personnel we may in the future acquire into our operations and our ability to realize related revenue synergies and cost savings within expected time frames and any goodwill charges related thereto; 33 • increased competitive pressures among financial services companies; • changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; • the availability of resources to address changes in laws, rules, or regulations or to respond to regulatory actions; • adverse changes in the securities markets; • inability of key third-party providers to perform their obligations to us; • changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines and practices, as may be adopted by the financial institution regulatory agencies, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board or the FASB; • other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services including the CARES Act; and • other risks detailed from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including this report on Form 10-Q. Many of the forward-looking statements are based upon management’s beliefs and assumptions at the time they are made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements included in this report or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking statements discussed in this report might not occur and you should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. As used throughout this report, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “HomeTrust Bancshares” or the “Company” refer to HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including HomeTrust Bank (“HomeTrust” or "Bank") unless the context indicates otherwise. Overview HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was formed for the purpose of becoming the holding company for HomeTrust Bank in connection with the Bank’s conversion from mutual to stock form, which was completed on July 10, 2012. As a bank holding company and financial holding company, we are regulated by the Federal Reserve. The Company has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank. As a North Carolina state-chartered bank, and member of the FRB, the Bank's primary regulators are the NCCOB and the Federal Reserve. The Bank's deposits are federally insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the FHLB System. Our headquarters is located in Asheville, North Carolina. The Bank has more than 30 locations across North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, many of which are located in markets experiencing growth rates above the national average. Historically, our branches and facilities have primarily been located in small- to medium-sized communities, but in recent years we have implemented a strategy of expanding into larger, higher growth markets via business banking centers rather than retail-focused branches. Our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds, along with borrowed funds, in commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, commercial and industrial loans, equipment finance leases, municipal leases, loans secured by first and second mortgages on one-to-four family residences including home equity and other consumer loans. We also originate one-to-four family loans, SBA loans, and HELOCs to sell to third parties. In addition, we invest in debt securities issued by United States Government agencies and GSEs, corporate bonds, commercial paper, and certificates of deposit in other banks insured by the FDIC. We offer a variety of deposit accounts for individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. Our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income. A secondary source of income is noninterest income, which includes revenue we receive from providing products and services, including service charges and fees on deposit accounts, loan income and fees, gains on the sale of loans held for sale, BOLI income, and operating lease income. An offset to net interest income is the provision for credit losses which is required to establish the ACL at a level that adequately provides for current expected credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, off balance sheet credit commitments, and available for sale debt securities. See "Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 1 of our 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion. Our noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, expenses for occupancy, marketing and computer services, and FDIC deposit insurance premiums. Salaries and benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement, and other employee benefits. Occupancy expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of lease payments, property taxes, depreciation charges, maintenance, and costs of utilities. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Certain of our accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex, or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances which could include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy, and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. The following represents our critical accounting policy: Allowance for Credit Losses, or ACL, on Loans.   The ACL reflects our estimate of credit losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. We charge off loans against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized. We use a systematic methodology to determine our ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be
34 collected on the loan portfolio. We consider the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The estimate of our ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, our process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. Our ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects our best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. We recognize in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for management’s current estimate of expected credit losses. Our ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans.

The results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were positively impacted by a $3.0 million increase in net interest income and a $1.1 million increase in noninterest income. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below. Net Interest Income.   The following table presents the distribution of average assets, liabilities and equity, as well as interest income on average interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on average interest-bearing liabilities. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.   Three Months Ended   December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Average Balance Outstanding Interest Earned / Paid (2) Yield / Rate (2) Average Balance Outstanding Interest Earned / Paid (2) Yield / Rate (2) Assets Interest-earning assets Loans receivable (1) $ 2,999,207 $ 39,282  5.20  % $ 2,880,148 $ 33,522  4.62  % Commercial paper 34,487 184  2.12  214,214 1,116  2.07  Debt securities available for sale 167,818 1,151  2.72  135,015 678  1.99  Other interest-earning assets (3) 86,430 1,072  4.92  113,821 888  3.10  Total interest-earning assets 3,287,942 41,689  5.03  3,343,198 36,204  4.30  Other assets 236,159 243,113 Total assets 3,524,101 3,586,311 Liabilities and equity Interest-bearing liabilities Interest-bearing checking accounts $ 627,548 $ 571  0.36  % $ 654,154 $ 268  0.16  % Money market accounts 954,007 1,935  0.80  968,084 521  0.21  Savings accounts 236,027 45  0.08  238,992 45  0.07  Certificate accounts 444,845 1,052  0.94  476,761 561  0.47  Total interest-bearing deposits 2,262,427 3,603  0.63  2,337,991 1,395  0.24  Borrowings 26,063 254  3.87  1,526 12  3.12  Total interest-bearing liabilities 2,288,490 3,857  0.67  2,339,517 1,407  0.24  Noninterest-bearing deposits 785,785 800,912 Other liabilities 44,333 51,485 Total liabilities 3,118,608 3,191,914 Stockholders' equity 405,493 394,397 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity 3,524,101 3,586,311 Net earning assets $ 999,452 $ 1,003,681 Average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities 143.67  % 142.90  % Tax-equivalent Net interest income $ 37,832  $ 34,797  Interest rate spread 4.36  % 4.06  % Net interest margin (4) 4.56  % 4.13  % Non-tax-equivalent Net interest income $ 37,545  $ 34,520  Interest rate spread 4.33  % 4.02  % Net interest margin (4) 4.53  % 4.10  % (1) The average loans receivable balances include loans held for sale and nonaccruing loans. (2) Interest income used in the average interest earned and yield calculation includes the tax equivalent adjustment of $287 and $277 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively, calculated based on a combined federal and state tax rate of 24%. (3) The average other interest-earning assets consist of FRB stock, FHLB stock, SBIC investments, and deposits in other banks. (4) Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $5.5 million, or 15.2%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, which was driven by a $5.8 million, or 17.3%, increase in interest income on loans. The overall increase in average yield on interest-earning assets and rate paid on liabilities was the result of rising interest rates. Specific to debt securities available for sale, the Company has intentionally maintained a relatively short-term duration portfolio which has allowed, and will continue to allow, the Company to take advantage of rising rates when reinvesting the proceeds of maturing instruments. 37 Total interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $2.5 million, or 174.1%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase was driven by a $2.2 million, or 158.3%, increase in interest expense on deposits as a result of a 39 basis point increase in the associated average cost of funds, and a $242,000 increase in interest expense on borrowings as a result of higher average balances and higher rates. The following table shows the effects that changes in average balances (volume), including differences in the number of days in the periods compared, and average interest rates (rate) had on the interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities: (Dollars in thousands) Increase / (Decrease) Due to Total Increase / (Decrease) Volume Rate Interest-earning assets Loans receivable $ 1,386  $ 4,374  $ 5,760  Commercial paper (936) 4  (932) Debt securities available for sale 165  308  473  Other interest-earning assets (214) 398  184  Total interest-earning assets 401  5,084  5,485  Interest-bearing liabilities Interest-bearing checking accounts (11) 314  303  Money market accounts (8) 1,422  1,414  Savings accounts (1) 1  —  Certificate accounts (38) 529  491  Borrowings 193  49  242  Total interest-bearing liabilities 135  2,315  2,450  Net increase in tax equivalent interest income $ 3,035  Provision for Credit Losses.    The provision for credit losses is the amount of expense that, based on our judgment, is required to maintain the ACL at an appropriate level under the CECL model. The following table presents a breakdown of the components of the provision for credit losses: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 $ Change % Change Provision for credit losses Loans $ 2,425  $ 3,694  $ (1,269) (34) % Off-balance-sheet credit exposure (85) 443  (528) (119) Commercial paper (100) (150) 50  33  Total provision for credit losses $ 2,240  $ 3,987  $ (1,747) (44) % For the quarter ended
December 31, 2022 , the "loans" portion of the provision for credit losses was the result of the following, offset by net charge-offs of $1.9 million during the quarter: • $1.6 million provision driven by loan growth and changes in the loan mix. • $0.4 million provision due to changes in the projected economic forecast, specifically the national unemployment rate, and changes in qualitative adjustments. • $1.5 million reduction of specific reserves on individually evaluated credits, which was tied to two relationships which were fully charged-off during the quarter. For the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the "loans" portion of the provision for credit losses was the result of the following, offset by net charge-offs of $83,000 during the quarter: • $1.3 million provision specific to fintech portfolios which have a riskier credit profile than loans originated in-house. The elevated credit risk is offset by the higher yields earned on the portfolios. • $1.3 million provision driven by loan growth and changes in the loan mix. • $1.1 million provision due to a projected worsening of the economic forecast, specifically the national unemployment rate, and changes in qualitative adjustments. For both periods presented, the change in the provision for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposure was the result of changes in the balance of loan commitments as well as changes in the loan mix and the projected economic forecast outlined above. 38 Noninterest Income.   Noninterest income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $1.1 million, or 14.3%, when compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Changes in selected components of noninterest income are discussed below: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 $ Change % Change Noninterest income Service charges and fees on deposit accounts $ 2,523  $ 2,338  $ 185  8  % Loan income and fees 647  570  77  14  Gain on sale of loans held for sale 1,102  1,586  (484) (31) BOLI income 494  527  (33) (6) Operating lease income 1,156  1,585  (429) (27) Gain (loss) on sale of premises and equipment 1,127  (12) 1,139  9,492  Other 1,405  804  601  75  Total noninterest income $ 8,454  $ 7,398  $ 1,056  14  % • Gain on sale of loans held for sale:
The decrease in the gain on sale of loans held for sale was primarily driven by a decrease in volume of residential mortgage and SBA loans sold during the period as a result of rising interest rates. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022,
$7.3 million of residential mortgage loans originated for sale were sold with gains of $183,000 compared to $20.9 million sold with gains of $493,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. There were $8.2 million of sales of the guaranteed portion of SBA commercial loans with gains of $568,000 in the current quarter compared to $12.1 million sold and gains of $891,000 in the prior quarter. There were $41.4 million of HELOCs sold during the current quarter for a gain of $340,000 compared to $22.8 million sold and gains of $202,000 in the prior quarter. • Operating lease income:
The decrease in operating lease income can be traced to lower contractual earnings as well as gains or losses incurred at the end of operating leases, where we recognized a net loss of $337,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 versus a net gain of $148,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. • Gain (loss) on sale of premises and equipment:
During the quarter ended December 31, 2022 two properties were sold for a combined gain of $1.6 million, partially offset by additional impairment of $420,000 on premises and equipment associated with prior branch closures. • Other:
The increase in other income was driven by a $721,000 gain recognized on the sale of closely held equity securities which the Company obtained through a prior bank acquisition. Noninterest Expense.   Noninterest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased $12,000, or 0.0%, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022. Changes in selected components of noninterest expense are discussed below: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 $ Change % Change Noninterest expense Salaries and employee benefits $ 14,484  $ 14,815  $ (331) (2) % Occupancy expense, net 2,428  2,396  32  1  Computer services 2,796  2,763  33  1  Telephone, postage and supplies 575  603  (28) (5) Marketing and advertising 481  590  (109) (18) Deposit insurance premiums 546  542  4  1  Core deposit intangible amortization 26  34  (8) (24) Merger-related expenses 250  474  (224) (47) Other 4,490  3,872  618  16  Total noninterest expense $ 26,076  $ 26,089  $ (13) —  % • Salaries and employee benefits:
The decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense is primarily the result of lower mortgage banking incentive pay as a result of the reduction in the volume of originations due to rising interest rates. • Merger-related expenses:
On July 24, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Quantum Capital Corp. The expense for both periods are costs incurred related to due diligence and legal work performed associated with the transaction, in addition to ongoing costs incurred in preparation for the transaction. • Other:
During the quarter ended December 31, 2022 the Company wrote off $350,000 in previously capitalized costs associated with a technology project which the Company is no longer pursuing. No such expense was incurred in the prior quarter. Income Taxes.   The amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, the amount of tax-exempt income, changes in the statutory rate, and the effect of changes in valuation allowances maintained against deferred tax benefits. Income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased $1.4 million as a result of higher taxable income in the current quarter and an increase in the effective tax rate which moved from 22.3% to 22.8% quarter-over-quarter. 39 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 Net Income.   Net income totaled $22.9 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to net income of $21.6 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, for the six months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $1.3 million, or 5.8%. The results for the six months ended December 31, 2022 were positively impacted by a $17.2 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by an increase of $10.2 million in the provision for credit losses and a $4.7 million decrease in noninterest income. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below. Net Interest Income.   The following table presents the distribution of average assets, liabilities and equity, as well as interest income earned on average interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on average interest-bearing liabilities. All average balances are daily average balances.

(3) The average other interest-earning assets consist of FRB stock, FHLB stock, SBIC investments, and deposits in other banks. (4) Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Total interest and dividend income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $19.5 million, or 33.8%, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021, which was driven by a $17.4 million, or 31.8%, increase in interest income on loans, and a combined increase of $1.7 million, or 124.6%, in interest income on commercial paper and debt securities available for sale. The overall increase in average yield on interest-earning assets and rate paid on liabilities was the result of rising interest rates. Specific to debt securities available for sale, the Company has intentionally maintained a relatively short-term duration portfolio which has allowed, and will continue to allow, the Company to take advantage of rising rates when reinvesting the proceeds of maturing instruments. 40 Total interest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $2.3 million, or 80.4%, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase was driven by a $2.1 million, or 73.7%, increase in interest expense on deposits as a result of an 18 basis point increase in the associated average cost of funds. The following table shows the effects that changes in average balances (volume), including differences in the number of days in the periods compared, and average interest rates (rate) had on the interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities: (Dollars in thousands) Increase / (Decrease) Due to Total Increase / (Decrease) Volume Rate Interest-earning assets Loans receivable $ 2,363  $ 15,011  $ 17,374  Commercial paper (161) 1,003  842  Debt securities available for sale 153  740  893  Other interest-earning assets (324) 708  384  Total interest-earning assets 2,031  17,462  19,493  Interest-bearing liabilities Interest-bearing checking accounts 6  104  110  Money market accounts (23) 1,763  1,740  Savings accounts 5  3  8  Certificate accounts 30  233  263  Borrowings (31) 256  225  Total interest-bearing liabilities (13) 2,359  2,346  Net increase in tax equivalent interest income $ 17,147  Provision (Benefit) for Credit Losses.   The following table presents a breakdown of the components of the provision (benefit) for credit losses: Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 $ Change % Change Provision (benefit) for credit losses Loans $ 6,119  $ (3,775) $ 9,894  262  % Off-balance-sheet credit exposure 358  (235) 593  252  Commercial paper (250) 50  (300) (600) Total provision (benefit) for credit losses $ 6,227  $ (3,960) $ 10,187  257  % For the six months ended
December 31, 2022 , the "loans" portion of the provision (benefit) for credit losses was the result of the following, offset by net charge-offs of $1.9 million during the period: • $1.3 million provision specific to fintech portfolios which have a riskier credit profile than loans originated in-house. The elevated credit risk is offset by the higher yields earned on the portfolios. • $2.9 million provision driven by loan growth and changes in the loan mix. • $1.5 million provision due to changes in the projected economic forecast, specifically the national unemployment rate, and changes in qualitative adjustments. • $1.5 million reduction of specific reserves on individually evaluated credits, which was tied to two relationships which were fully charged-off during the period. For the six months ended December 31, 2021, the "loans" portion of the benefit for credit losses was driven by an improvement in the economic forecast, as more clarity was gained regarding the impact of COVID-19 upon the loan portfolio. For both periods presented, the change in the provision for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposure was the result of changes in the balance of loan commitments as well as changes in the loan mix and the projected economic forecast outlined above. 41 Noninterest Income.   Noninterest income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased $4.6 million, or 22.5%, when compared to the same period last year. Changes in selected components of noninterest income are discussed below: Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 $ Change % Change Noninterest income Service charges and fees on deposit accounts $ 4,861  $ 4,885  $ (24) —  % Loan income and fees 1,217  1,784  (567) (32) Gain on sale of loans held for sale 2,688  7,958  (5,270) (66) BOLI income 1,021  1,008  13  1  Operating lease income 2,741  3,258  (517) (16) Gain (loss) on sale of premises and equipment 1,115  (87) 1,202  1,382  Other 2,209  1,639  570  35  Total noninterest income $ 15,852  $ 20,445  $ (4,593) (22) % • Loan income and fees:
The decrease in loan income and fees was driven by lower underwriting fees, interest rate swap fees, and prepayment penalties in the current period compared to the same period last year, all of which were impacted by rising interest rates. • Gain on sale of loans held for sale:
The decrease in the gain on sale of loans held for sale was primarily driven by a decrease in volume of residential mortgage and SBA loans sold during the period as a result of rising interest rates. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, $28.2 million of residential mortgage loans originated for sale were sold with gains of $676,000 compared to $150.7 million sold with gains of $4.3 million for the corresponding period in the prior year. There were $20.3 million of sales of the guaranteed portion of SBA commercial loans with gains of $1.5 million in the current period
compared to $27.0 million sold and gains of $3.1 million
for the corresponding period in the prior year. There were $64.2 million of HELOCs sold during the current period for a gain of $542,000 compared to $72.2 million sold and gains of $426,000 for the corresponding period in the prior year. Lastly, $11.5 million of indirect auto finance loans were sold out of the held for investment portfolio during the six months ended December 31, 2021 for a gain of $205,000. No such sales occurred in the same period in the current year.
• Operating lease income:
The decrease in operating lease income can be traced to lower contractual earnings as well as gains or losses incurred at the end of operating leases, where we recognized a net loss of $189,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 versus a net loss of $92,000 in the same period last year. • Gain (loss) on sale of premises and equipment:
During the six months ended December 31, 2022 two properties were sold for a combined gain of $1.6 million, partially offset by additional impairment of $420,000 on premises and equipment associated with prior branch closures. No such sales occurred in the same period in the prior year. • Other:
The increase in other income was driven by a $721,000 gain recognized on the sale of closely held equity securities which the Company obtained through a prior bank acquisition. No such sales occurred in the same period in the prior year. Noninterest Expense.   Noninterest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $265,000, or 0.5%, when compared to the same period last year. Changes in selected components of noninterest expense are discussed below: Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 $ Change % Change Noninterest expense Salaries and employee benefits $ 29,299  $ 30,152  $ (853) (3) % Occupancy expense, net 4,824  4,718  106  2  Computer services 5,559  5,130  429  8  Telephone, postage and supplies 1,178  1,322  (144) (11) Marketing and advertising 1,071  1,537  (466) (30) Deposit insurance premiums 1,088  868  220  25  Core deposit intangible amortization 60  158  (98) (62) Merger-related expenses 724  —  724  100  Other 8,362  7,953  409  5  Total noninterest expense $ 52,165  $ 51,838  $ 327  1  % • Salaries and employee benefits : The decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense in the current period compared to the same period last year is primarily the result of branch closures and lower mortgage banking incentive pay as a result of the reduction in the volume of originations due to rising interest rates. • Computer services : The increase in expense between periods is due to continued investments in technology as well as increases in the cost of services provided by third parties. • Marketing and advertising : The decrease in expense between periods is due to lower projected marketing expenses for the current fiscal year versus the prior period. • Deposit insurance premiums:
The rates the Company is charged for deposit insurance have increased year-over-year. 42 • Merger-related expenses:
On July 24, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Quantum Capital Corp. The expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are costs incurred related to due diligence and legal work performed associated with the transaction, in addition to ongoing costs incurred in preparation for the transaction. No such expense was incurred in the prior period. • Other:
During the six months ended December 31, 2022 the Company wrote off $350,000 in previously capitalized costs associated with a technology project which the Company is no longer pursuing. No such expense was incurred in the prior period. Income Taxes.   The amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, the amount of tax-exempt income, changes in the statutory rate, and the effect of changes in valuation allowances maintained against deferred tax benefits. Income tax expense for the six months ended December 31, 2022 increased $831,000 as a result of higher taxable income in the current quarter compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, and an increase in the effective tax rate from 21.3% to 22.6% between periods. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022

Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Allowance for credit losses.   The ACL on loans was $38.9 million, or 1.30% of total loans, at December 31, 2022 compared to $34.7 million, or 1.25% of total loans, as of June 30, 2022. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans was 0.13% for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 0.05% for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The drivers of these quarter-over-quarter changes are discussed in the "Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021" section above. Other assets.
Other assets decreased $4.1 million, or 7.6%, to $48.9 million at December 31, 2022 from $53.0 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by lower current taxes receivable and the sale of properties held for sale. Other liabilities.
Other liabilities decreased $1.8 million, or 2.9%, during the six months ended December 31, 2022 to $58.8 million, as a result of the payout of annual short-term incentives for the prior fiscal year. Deposits.
The following table summarizes the composition of our deposit portfolio as of the dates indicated: As of December 31, June 30, Change (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2022 $ % Core deposits      Noninterest-bearing accounts $ 726,416  $ 745,746  $ (19,330) (3) %      NOW accounts 638,896  654,981  (16,085) (2)      Money market accounts 992,083  969,661  22,422  2       Savings accounts 230,896  238,197  (7,301) (3) Core deposits 2,588,291  2,608,585  (20,294) (1) Certificates of deposit 459,729  491,176  (31,447) (6) Total $ 3,048,020  $ 3,099,761  $ (51,741) (2) % Liquidity Management maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide for funding of loan demand and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. The primary sources are increases in deposit accounts, wholesale borrowings, and cash flows from loan payments and the securities portfolio. In addition to these primary sources of funds, management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank had an available borrowing capacity of $111.4 million and $92.0 million with the FHLB of Atlanta and FRB, respectively, and lines of credit with three unaffiliated banks totaling $120.0 million. Additionally, we classify our securities portfolio as available for sale, providing an additional source of liquidity. Management believes that our securities portfolio is of high quality and the securities would therefore be marketable. In addition, we have historically sold fixed-rate mortgage loans in the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and to create still another source of liquidity. From time to time we also utilize brokered time deposits to supplement our other sources of funds. Brokered time deposits are obtained by utilizing an outside broker that is paid a fee. This funding requires advance notification to structure the type of deposit desired by us. Brokered deposits can vary in term from one month to several years and have the benefit of being a source of longer-term funding. We also utilize brokered deposits to help manage interest rate risk by extending the term to repricing of our liabilities, enhance our liquidity, and fund asset growth. Brokered deposits are typically from outside our primary market areas, and our brokered deposit levels may vary from time to time depending on competitive interest rate conditions and other factors. At December 31, 2022 brokered deposits totaled $50.4 million, or 1.7%, of total deposits. Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments, such as overnight deposits and federal funds. On a longer term basis, we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products and debt securities, including MBS. On a stand-alone basis we are a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for our own liquidity and pay our own operating expenses. Our primary source of funds consists of dividends or capital distributions from the Bank, although there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. At December 31, 2022, we (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of $5.7 million. At the Bank level, we use our sources of funds primarily to meet our ongoing commitments, pay maturing deposits and fund withdrawals, and fund loan commitments. At December 31, 2022, the total approved loan commitments and unused lines of credit outstanding amounted to $362.5 million and $540.4 million, respectively, as compared to $417.6 million and $485.2 million as of June 30, 2022. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at December 31, 2022, totaled $331.8 million. It is management's policy to manage deposit rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions. Based on this management strategy, we believe a majority of our maturing deposits will remain with us. Off-Balance Sheet Activities In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that are not recorded in our financial statements, mainly to manage customers' requests for funding. These transactions primarily take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit and involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet credit, interest rate, and liquidity risks.

Commitments and Contingencies" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 44 Capital Resources At December 31, 2022, stockholders' equity totaled $410.2 million compared to $388.8 million at June 30, 2022, an increase of $21.4 million which was the result of net income for the six months .  HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is a bank holding company subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve. As a bank holding company, we are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. Our subsidiary, the Bank, an FDIC-insured, North Carolina state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is supervised and regulated by the FRB and NCCOB and is subject to minimum capital requirements applicable to state member banks established by the Federal Reserve that are calculated in a manner similar to those applicable to bank holding companies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly discretionary actions by bank regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. At December 31, 2022, HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank each exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Consistent with our goals to operate a sound and profitable organization, our policy is for the Bank to maintain a “well-capitalized” status under the regulatory capital categories of the Federal Reserve. The Bank was categorized as "well-capitalized" under applicable regulatory requirements. HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc.'s and the Bank's actual and required minimum capital amounts and ratios   are as follows:   Regulatory Requirements Actual Minimum for Capital Adequacy Purposes Minimum to Be Well Capitalized (Dollars in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc.

The initial adoption of ASU 2016-13 as well as 25% of the quarterly increases in the ACL subsequent to adoption (collectively the “transition adjustments”) was delayed for two years. Starting July 1, 2022, the cumulative amount of the transition adjustments became fixed and will be phased out of the regulatory capital calculations evenly over a three-year period, with 75% recognized in year three, 50% recognized in year four, and 25% recognized in year five. After five years, the temporary regulatory capital benefits will be fully reversed. In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios, both HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank have to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital of more than 2.50% above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's and Bank's risk-based capital exceeded the required capital contribution buffer. Dividends paid by HomeTrust Bank are limited, without regulatory approval, to current year earnings less dividends paid during the preceding two years. 45 Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There has not been any material change in the market risk disclosures contained in our 2022 Form 10-K. Item 4.        Controls and Procedures An evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Act")) as of December 31, 2022, was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer   and several other members of the Company's senior management.   The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures in effect as of December 31, 2022, were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Act is: (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by override of the control. The design of any control procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
