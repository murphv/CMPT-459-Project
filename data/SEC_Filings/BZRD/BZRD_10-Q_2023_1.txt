Notes
to the Unaudited Financial Statements
Note 1 - Organization and Description
of Business
Blubuzzard, Inc. (we, us, our, or
the "Company") was incorporated on December 6, 2018 in the State of Delaware with the name Fast Lane Holdings, Inc. The Company
was created for the sole purpose of participating in a Delaware holding company reorganization with Giant Motorsports Delaware Inc. (“GMOS
Delaware”), a Delaware corporation incorporated on December 6, 2018 and parent company of Fast Lane Holding, Inc. and Giant Motorsports
Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated on December 6, 2018 and a wholly owned subsidiary of Fast Lane Holdings, Inc. pursuant
to Section 251(g) of the General Corporation Law of the state of Delaware, (the “DGCL”).
On December 6, 2018, Paul Moody was
appointed Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Director of Fast Lane Holdings, Inc., Giant Motorsports Delaware, Inc.
and Giant Motorsports Merger Sub, Inc.
On December 28, 2018, Giant
Motorsports, Inc. (“GMOS Nevada”), a Nevada corporation merged with and into GMOS Delaware, a wholly owned subsidiary of GMOS
Nevada with GMOS Delaware as the surviving corporation. The sole purpose to merge GMOS Nevada with and into GMOS Delaware was to re-domesticate
GMOS Nevada from Nevada to Delaware.
On December 28, 2018, Giant
Motorsports Delaware, Inc. completed a holding company reorganization pursuant to Section 251(g) of the DGCL by merging with and into
its indirect wholly owned subsidiary known as Giant Motorsports Merger Sub, Inc. with Giant Motorsports Delaware, Inc. as the surviving
corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Fast Lane Holdings, Inc.
Fast Lane Holdings, Inc., as successor
issuer to Giant Motorsports, Inc., continued to trade in the OTC MarketPlace under the previous ticker symbol “GMOS” until
the new ticker symbol “FLHI” for the Company was released into the OTC MarketPlace on January 10, 2019. Concurrently, the
Company cancelled all of its stock held in GMOS Delaware.
On October 21, 2019, Giant
Consulting Services, LLC, the largest controlling shareholder of Fast Lane Holdings, Inc., consummated a sale of 60,000,000 shares
of our restricted common stock (pre-split) and 2,550 shares of preferred stock to Lykato Group, LLC, a Florida Limited Liability
Company and an accredited investor. Following the closing of the share purchase transaction, Lykato Group, LLC owns approximately
82.25% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. Lykato Group, LLC is now the largest controlling
shareholder of the Company. Lykato Group, LLC is controlled by James Xilas.
On October 21, 2019, Mr. Paul Moody
resigned as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director. The resignation was not
the result of any disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.
On October 21, 2019, Mr. James Xilas
was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director and our name was changed
to Blubuzzard, Inc.
On
December 11, 2019, James Xilas being the sole board director and majority shareholder by and through his beneficial interest in Lykato
Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, did hereby take, ratify, affirm, and approve a 10:1 forward stock split affecting both
authorized and outstanding common shares, change of our corporate name from “Fast Lane Holdings, Inc.” to “Blubuzzard,
Inc.” and a ticker symbol change from “FLHI” to “BZRD”. The foregoing changes were effective on December
27, 2019 upon the filing of a Certificate of Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.
The Company’s bylaws were amended to reflect the name change with no other changes made. The Company’s CUSIP number changed
from 31189D109 to 095228102 as a result of the aforementioned actions. The market effective date for the symbol change is and was February
7, 2020. Pre-Split total common shares outstanding is and was 72,948,316. Post-Split total common shares outstanding is and remains 729,483,160.
The Company intends to serve as a
vehicle to affect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business.
As of September 30, 2022, the Company had not yet commenced any operations.
The Company has elected December
31st as its year end.

Basis of Presentation
This summary of significant accounting
policies is presented to assist in understanding the Company's financial statements. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles,
generally accepted in the United States of America, and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary in order
to make the financial statements not misleading have been included. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $0 for both periods.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment
occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize
tax assets through future operations. No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share
The Company computes basic and diluted
earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share . Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed
by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings
(loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised
or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company.
The Company does not have any potentially
dilutive instruments as of September 30, 2022 and, thus, anti-dilution issues are not applicable.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s
balance sheet includes certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their
fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.
ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures , defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an
exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions
developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about
market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair
value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy
are described below:
- Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted
prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices
for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are
not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are
derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
- Level 3 - Inputs that are both
significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

Table of Contents
Fair value estimates discussed herein
are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2022. The respective carrying
value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
These financial instruments include accrued expenses.
Related Parties
The Company follows ASC 850,  Related
Party Disclosures,  for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.
Share-Based Compensation
ASC 718, “ Compensation –
Stock Compensation ”, prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee
services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments
such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized
over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period
(usually the vesting period).
The Company accounts for stock-based
compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50, “ Equity – Based Payments
to Non-Employees.”   Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value
of whichever is more reliably measurable:  (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued.  The fair
value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.
The Company had no
stock-based compensation plans as of September 30, 2022.
The Company’s stock-based compensation
for the periods ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 was $0 for both periods.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02  is amended by ASU 2018-01, ASU2018-10, ASU
2018-11, ASU 2018-20 and ASU 2019-01, which FASB issued in January 2018, July 2018, July 2018, December 2018 and March 2019, respectively
(collectively, the amended ASU 2016-02). The amended ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset,
representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability for all leases with terms greater than 12
months. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly
changed from current GAAP. The amended ASU 2016-02 retains a distinction between finance leases (i.e. capital leases under current GAAP)
and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases will be substantially
similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases under current GAAP. The amended
ASU 2016-02 also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows
arising from leases. A modified retrospective transition approach is permitted to be used when an entity adopts the amended ASU 2016-02,
which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply.
We
have no assets and or leases and do not believe we will be impacted in the foreseeable future by the newly adopted accounting standard(s)
mentioned above.
The Company has implemented all new
accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other
new pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
Note 3 - Going
Concern
The Company’s financial statements
are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization
of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The Company demonstrates adverse
conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year following the issuance
of these financial statements. These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically operating loss, working capital deficiency,
and other adverse key financial ratios.
The Company has not established any
source of revenue to cover its operating costs. Management plans to fund operating expenses with related party contributions to capital.
There is no assurance that management's plan will be successful. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the
event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.
Note 4 - Income Taxes
The Company has not recognized an income tax benefit for its operating losses generated based on uncertainties concerning its ability
to generate taxable income in future periods. The tax benefit for the period presented is offset by a valuation allowance established
against deferred tax assets arising from the net operating losses, the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not.
In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts
to be more likely than not. As of September 30, 2022, the Company has incurred a net loss of approximately $129,382 which resulted in
a net operating loss for income tax purposes. The loss results in a deferred tax asset of approximately $27,170 at the effective statutory
rate of 21%. The deferred tax asset has been offset by an equal valuation allowance.
Note 5 -
Commitments and Contingencies
The Company follows ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies, to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising
from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. There were no commitments or contingencies as of September 30,
2022.
Note 6 - Accrued
Expenses
Accrued expenses totaled
$0 as of September 30, 2022 and $ 1,200
as of December 31, 2021 and consisted primarily of professional fees.
Note 7 - Shareholder
Equity
Preferred Stock
The authorized preferred stock of the Company consists of 20,000,000 shares
with a par value of $0.001. There are 5,000 shares of Series A convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
Common Stock
The authorized common stock of the
Company consists of 5,000,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.001. There were 729,483,160 shares of common stock issued and outstanding
as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
Note 8 - Related-Party

ITEM 2
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report of Blubuzzard,
Inc. on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, particularly those identified with the words, “anticipates,” “believes,”
“expects,” “plans,” “intends,” “objectives,” and similar expressions. These statements
reflect management's best judgment based on factors known at the time of such statements. The reader may find discussions containing such
forward-looking statements in the material set forth under “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations,” generally, and specifically therein under the captions “Liquidity and Capital Resources” as well as
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed herein. The forward-looking
statements specified in the following information have been compiled by our management on the basis of assumptions made by management
and considered by management to be reasonable. Our future operating results, however, are impossible to predict and no representation,
guarantee, or warranty is to be inferred from those forward-looking statements.
The assumptions used for purposes of the forward-looking
statements specified in the following information represent estimates of future events and are subject to uncertainty as to possible changes
in economic, legislative, industry, and other circumstances. As a result, the identification and interpretation of data and other information
and their use in developing and selecting assumptions from and among reasonable alternatives require the exercise of judgment. To the
extent that the assumed events do not occur, the outcome may vary substantially from anticipated or projected results, and, accordingly,
no opinion is expressed on the achievability of those forward-looking statements. No assurance can be given that any of the assumptions
relating to the forward-looking statements specified in the following information are accurate, and we assume no obligation to update
any such forward-looking statements.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires
management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends
and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are prepared. Due to the need to make
estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions
or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation
of our financial statements.
While we believe that the historical experience, current trends and other
factors considered support the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, actual results could differ from our estimates
and such differences could be material.
PLAN OF OPERATION
The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination
and has made no efforts thus far to identify a possible business combination. As a result, the Company has not conducted negotiations
or entered into a letter of intent concerning any target business. The business purpose of the Company is to seek the acquisition of or
merger with, an existing company.
The
Company, based on proposed business activities, is a "blank check" company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) defines
those companies as "any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51)-1 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business
plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies or other entity or person." Under SEC Rule 12b-2
under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a shell company, because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or
nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of "blank check" companies
in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities,
either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.
The
Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the
perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company’s principal business objective for the next 12 months and
beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term
earnings. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location
and, thus, may acquire any type of business. The company may merge with or acquire another company in which the promoters, management,
or promoters’ or managements’ affiliates or associates, directly or indirectly, have an ownership interest.
RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
We generated $0 in revenue for the three and nine month periods ended September
30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. Our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 were $29,667 and
$23,397, respectively. Our operating expenses for the
three months ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 were $4,833 and
$16,109, respectively
Operating expenses were solely general and administrative in nature.
Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 were $29,667 and $23,397, respectively. Our
net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 were $4,833 and $16,109, respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We have no known demands or commitments and are not
aware of any events or uncertainties as of September 30, 2022 that will result in or that are reasonably likely to materially increase or
decrease our current liquidity.
We had no material commitments for capital expenditures
as of September 30, 2022.
For future expenses we intend to be funded by our
sole officer and director. There is a possibility that our sole officer and director may not loan or provide us any such funds.

CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and rep orted within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated t o our management, including our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer (both of whom are James Xilas), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. In designing and
evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily
was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
