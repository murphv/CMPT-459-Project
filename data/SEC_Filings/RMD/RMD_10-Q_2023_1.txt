AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (1)     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization and Basis of Presentation
ResMed Inc. (referred to herein as “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation formed in March 1994 as a holding company for the ResMed Group. Through our subsidiaries, we design, manufacture and market equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing and other respiratory disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea. Our manufacturing operations are located in Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, France, China and the United States. Major distribution and sales sites are located in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia, Japan, China, Finland, Norway and Sweden. We also operate a Software as a Service (“SaaS”) business in the United States and Germany that includes out-of-hospital software platforms designed to support the professionals and caregivers who help people stay healthy in the home or care setting of their choice.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring items, have been included in the accompanying financial statements to present fairly the results of the interim periods. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.
The condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (our “Form 10-K”) for the year ended June 30, 2022. Revenue Recognition In accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, we account for a contract with a customer when there is a legally enforceable contract, the rights of the parties are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of the contract consideration is probable. We have determined that we have
two
operating segments, which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry (“Sleep and Respiratory Care”) and the supply of business management software as a service to out-of-hospital care providers (“SaaS”). Our Sleep and Respiratory Care revenue relates primarily to the sale of our products that are therapy-based equipment. Some contracts include additional performance obligations such as the provision of extended warranties and provision of data for patient monitoring. Our SaaS revenue relates to the provision of software access with ongoing support and maintenance services as well as professional services such as training and consulting.

For products in our Sleep and Respiratory Care business, we transfer control and recognize a sale when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contractual shipping terms. For our SaaS business, revenue associated with cloud-hosted services are recognized as they are provided. We defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received when performance obligations are not yet satisfied. Consideration received from customers in advance of revenue recognition is classified as deferred revenue. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our Sleep and Respiratory Care business relate primarily to extended warranties on our devices and the provision of data for patient monitoring. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our SaaS business relate primarily to the provision of software access with maintenance and support over an agreed term and material rights associated with future discounts upon renewal of some SaaS contracts. Generally, deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of
one year
to
five years . Our contracts do not contain significant financing components. The following table summarizes our contract balances (in thousands):   December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Balance sheet caption Contract assets Accounts receivable, net $ 672,271   $ 575,950   Accounts receivable, net Unbilled revenue, current 23,110   25,692   Prepaid expenses and other current assets Unbilled revenue, non-current 8,935   8,840   Prepaid taxes and other non-current assets   Contract liabilities Deferred revenue, current ( 133,909 ) ( 108,667 ) Deferred revenue (current liabilities) Deferred revenue, non-current ( 102,803 ) ( 95,455 ) Deferred revenue (non-current liabilities) Transaction price determination Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. In our Sleep and Respiratory Care segment, the amount of consideration received and revenue recognized varies with changes in marketing incentives (e.g. rebates, discounts, free goods) and returns offered to our customers and their
10 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 1 RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) customers. When we give customers the right to return eligible products and receive credit, returns are estimated based on an analysis of our historical experience. However, returns of products, excluding warranty-related returns, have historically been infrequent and insignificant. We adjust the estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration can be estimated, the amount expected to be received changes, or when the consideration becomes fixed. We offer our Sleep and Respiratory Care customers cash or product rebates based on volume or sales targets measured over quarterly or annual periods. We estimate rebates based on each customer’s expected achievement of its targets. In accounting for these rebate programs, we reduce revenue ratably as sales occur over the rebate period by the expected value of the rebates to be returned to the customer. Rebates measured over a quarterly period are updated based on actual sales results and, therefore, no estimation is required to determine the reduction to revenue. For rebates measured over annual periods, we update our estimates each quarter based on actual sales results and updated forecasts for the remaining rebate periods.
We participate in programs where we issue credits to our Sleep and Respiratory Care distributors when they are required to sell our products below negotiated list prices if we have preexisting contracts with the distributors' customers. We reduce revenue for future credits at the time of sale to the distributor, which we estimate based on historical experience using the expected value method.
We also offer discounts to both our Sleep and Respiratory Care as well as our SaaS customers as part of normal business practice and these are deducted from revenue when the sale occurs. When Sleep and Respiratory Care or SaaS contracts have multiple performance obligations, we generally use an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price by reference to pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately to similar customers. Revenue is then allocated proportionately, based on the determined stand-alone selling price, to each performance obligation. An allocation is not required for many of our Sleep and Respiratory Care contracts that have a single performance obligation, which is the shipment of our therapy-based equipment. Accounting and practical expedient elections We have elected to account for shipping and handling activities associated with our Sleep and Respiratory Care segment as a fulfillment cost within cost of sales, and record shipping and handling costs collected from customers in net revenue. We have also elected for all taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions, such as sales and value added taxes, to be excluded from revenue and presented on a net basis. We have elected two practical expedients including the “right to invoice” practical expedient, which is relevant for some of our SaaS contracts as it allows us to recognize revenue in the amount of the invoice when it corresponds directly with the value of performance completed to date. The second practical expedient adopted permits relief from considering a significant financing component when the payment for the good or service is expected to be one year or less. Lease Revenue We lease Sleep and Respiratory Care medical devices to customers primarily as a means to comply with local health insurer requirements in certain foreign geographies. Device rental contracts include operating leases, and contract terms vary by customer and include options to terminate or extend the contract. When lease contracts also include the sale of masks and accessories, we allocate contract consideration to those items on a relative standalone price basis and recognize revenue when control transfers to the customer.
Operating lease revenue was $ 20.4
million and $ 44.1
million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and $ 24.4
million and $ 49.6
million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021. Provision for Warranty
We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties on our Sleep and Respiratory Care products at the time the related revenue is recognized. We determine the amount of this provision by using a financial model, which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products. We use this financial model to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision. Although we engage in product improvement programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures. Should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates, we would be required to revise our estimated warranty provision. 11 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 1 RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (2)     Segment Information We have quantitatively and qualitatively determined that we operate in
two
operating segments, which are the Sleep and Respiratory Care segment and the SaaS segment.
We evaluate the performance of our segments based on net revenues and income from operations. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. Segment net revenues and segment income from operations do not include inter-segment profits and revenue is allocated to a geographic area based on where the products are shipped to or where the services are performed.
Certain items are maintained at the corporate level and are not allocated to the segments. The non-allocated items include corporate headquarters costs, stock-based compensation, amortization expense from acquired intangibles, acquisition related expenses, net interest expense (income), loss attributable to equity method investments, gains and losses on equity investments, and other, net. We neither discretely allocate assets to our operating segments, nor does our Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluate the operating segments using discrete asset information. Additionally, effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we updated the extent of allocation and method of attribution of certain shared costs that are principally managed at the corporate level as part of our evaluation of segment operating performance. As a result, certain shared administrative costs, including shared IT, legal and other administrative functions, which were previously included in segment operating results, are now reported in Corporate costs within our reconciliation of segment operating profit to income before income taxes. The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the preceding reporting change for all periods presented. The table below presents a reconciliation of net revenues and net operating profit by reportable segments (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net revenue by segment Total Sleep and Respiratory Care $ 916,981   $ 795,840   $ 1,761,424   $ 1,602,339   Software as a Service 116,763   99,034   222,614   196,551   Total $ 1,033,744   $ 894,874   $ 1,984,038   $ 1,798,890   Depreciation and amortization by segment Sleep and Respiratory Care $ 18,533   $ 19,347   $ 38,301   $ 37,362   Software as a Service 2,097   1,857   4,009   3,558   Amortization of acquired intangible assets and corporate assets 17,137   19,585   31,730   38,971   Total $ 37,767   $ 40,789   $ 74,040   $ 79,891   Net operating profit by segment Sleep and Respiratory Care $ 373,367   $ 324,469   $ 726,027   $ 661,465   Software as a Service 28,814   22,336   53,581   44,243   Total $ 402,181   $ 346,805   $ 779,608   $ 705,708   Reconciling items Corporate costs $ 96,707   $ 79,125   $ 183,326   $ 157,350   Amortization of acquired intangible assets 16,868   18,969   31,193   37,734   Acquisition related expenses 8,412   —   9,157   —   Interest expense (income), net 10,338   5,948   17,472   11,308   Loss attributable to equity method investments 2,826   1,914   4,853   3,300   (Gain) loss on equity investments ( 8,368 ) 4,404   ( 5,088 ) ( 1,208 ) Other, net 1,707   ( 841 ) 3,211   1,150   Income before income taxes $ 273,691   $ 237,286   $ 535,484   $ 496,074   12 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 1 RESMED INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (5)     Investments We have equity investments in privately and publicly held companies that are unconsolidated entities. The following discusses our investments in marketable equity securities, non-marketable equity securities, and investments accounted for under the equity method. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. Marketable equity securities are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity securities consist of investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values and are recorded in prepaid taxes and other non-current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity securities are reported at cost, minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. We assess non-marketable equity securities at least quarterly for impairment and consider qualitative and quantitative factors including the investee's financial metrics, product and commercial outlook and cash usage. All gains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in gain (loss) on equity investments as a component of other income (loss), net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Equity investments whereby we have significant influence, but not control over the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities, are accounted for under the equity method. Under this method, we record our share of gains or losses attributable to equity method investments as a component of other income (loss), net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Equity investments by measurement category were as follows (in thousands): Measurement category December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 Fair value $ 4,980   $ 9,167   Measurement alternative 65,697   39,290   Equity method 64,099   9,918   Total $ 134,776   $ 58,375   The following tables show a reconciliation of the changes in our equity investments (in thousands):   Six Months Ended December 31, 2022   Non-marketable securities Marketable securities Equity method investments Total Balance at the beginning of the period $ 39,290   $ 9,167   $ 9,918   $ 58,375   Additions to investments

Net unrealized gains recognized for equity investments in non-marketable and marketable securities held as of December 31, 2022 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 were $ 8.4
million and $ 5.1
million. Net unrealized losses recognized for equity investments in non-marketable and marketable securities held as of December 31, 2021 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 were $ 6.9
million and $ 2.8
million. (6)     Income Taxes In accordance with ASC 740
Income Taxes , each interim reporting period is considered integral to the annual period, and tax expense is measured using an estimated annual effective tax rate. An entity is required to record income tax expense each quarter based on its annual effective tax rate estimated for the full fiscal year and use that rate to provide for income taxes on a current year-to-date basis, adjusted for discrete taxable events that occur during the interim period. On September 19, 2021, we concluded the settlement agreement with the Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) in relation to the previously disclosed transfer pricing dispute for the tax years 2009 through 2018 (“ATO settlement”). The ATO settlement fully resolved the dispute for all prior years, with no admission of liability and provides clarity in relation to certain future taxation principles. On September 28, 2021, we remitted final payment to the ATO of $ 284.8
million, consisting of the agreed settlement amount of $ 381.7
million less prior remittances made to the ATO of $ 96.9
million. (7)     Product Warranties Changes in the liability for warranty costs, which is included in accrued expenses in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, are as follows (in thousands): Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 25,889   $ 22,032   Warranty accruals for the period 5,099   9,751   Warranty costs incurred for the period

The Revolving Credit Agreement, among other things, provided a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $ 1,500.0
million, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional amount equal to the greater of $ 1,000.0
million and
1.00
times the EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) for the trailing twelve-month measurement period. The Revolving Credit Agreement amends and restates that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2018, among ResMed, MUFG Union Bank, N.A., Westpac Banking Corporation and the lenders party thereto. Additionally, on June 29, 2022, ResMed Pty Limited entered into a Second Amendment to the Syndicated Facility Agreement and First Amendment to Unconditional Guaranty Agreement (the “Term Credit Agreement”), as borrower, with lenders MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger and joint book runner, and Westpac Banking Corporation, as syndication agent, joint lead arranger and joint book runner, which amends that certain Syndicated Facility Agreement dated as of April 17, 2018. The Term Credit Agreement, among other things, provides ResMed Pty a senior unsecured term credit facility of $ 195.0
million.
Our obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries, and ResMed Pty Limited’s obligations under the Term Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement contain customary covenants, including, in each case, a financial covenant that requires that we maintain a maximum leverage ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement, as applicable). The entire principal amounts of the revolving credit facility and term credit facility, and, in each case, any accrued but unpaid interest may be declared immediately due and payable if an event of default occurs, as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement, as applicable. Events of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement include, in each case, failure to make payments when due, the occurrence of a default in the performance of any covenants in the respective agreements or related documents, or certain changes of control of us, or the respective guarantors of the obligations borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement.
The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement each terminate on June 29, 2027, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. Amounts borrowed under the Term Credit Agreement will also amortize on a semi-annual basis, with a $ 5.0
million principal payment required on each such semi-annual amortization date. The outstanding principal amounts will bear interest at a rate equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) plus
0.75 % to
1.50 % (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio) or the Base Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement, as applicable) plus
0.0 % to
0.50 % (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio). At December 31, 2022, the interest rate that was being charged on the outstanding principal amounts was
5.2 %. An applicable commitment fee of
0.075 % to
0.150 % (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio) applies on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2022, we had $ 390.0
million available for draw down under the revolving credit facility. 16 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 1 RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) We are required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the value, even though these instruments are not recognized at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. As the Revolving Credit and Term Credit Agreements’ interest rate is calculated as Adjusted Term SOFR plus the spreads described above, its carrying amount is equivalent to its fair value as at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, which was $ 1,305.0
million and $ 280.0
million, respectively.
Senior Notes On July 10, 2019, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with the purchasers to that agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale of $ 250.0
million principal amount of our
3.24 % senior notes due July 10, 2026, and $ 250.0
million principal amount of our
3.45 % senior notes due July 10, 2029 (collectively referred to as the “Senior Notes”). Our obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement and the Senior Notes are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries. The net proceeds from this transaction were used to pay down borrowings on our Revolving Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, we agreed to customary covenants including with respect to our corporate existence, transactions with affiliates, and mergers and other extraordinary transactions. We also agreed that, subject to limited exceptions, we will maintain a ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) of no more than
3.50
to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and will not at any time permit the amount of all priority secured and unsecured debt of us and our subsidiaries to exceed
10 % of our consolidated tangible assets, determined as of the end of our most recently ended fiscal quarter. This ratio is calculated at the end of each reporting period for which the Note Purchase Agreement requires us to deliver financial statements, using the results of the 12 consecutive month period ending with such reporting period. We are required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the value, even though these instruments are not recognized at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the Senior Notes had a carrying amount of $ 500.0
million, excluding deferred borrowing costs, and an estimated fair value of $ 460.9
million and $ 477.7
million, respectively. Quoted market prices in active markets for similar liabilities based inputs (Level 2) were used to estimate fair value. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with our debt covenants and there was $ 1,805.0
million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes.
(9)     Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the denominator includes both the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and the number of dilutive common stock equivalents such as stock options and restricted stock units.
The weighted average number of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share were
293,796
and
49,762
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and
270,100
and
25,470
for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. 17 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 1 RESMED INC.

(10)     Legal Actions, Contingencies and Commitments
Litigation In the normal course of business, we are subject to routine litigation incidental to our business. While the results of this litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that their final outcome will not, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. On June 2, 2021, New York University ("NYU") filed a complaint for patent infringement in the United States District Court, District of Delaware against ResMed Inc., case no. 1:21-cv-00813 (JPM). The complaint alleges that the AutoSet or AutoRamp features of ResMed’s AirSense 10 AutoSet flow generators infringe one or more claims of various NYU patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 6,988,994; 9,108,009; 9,168,344; 9,427,539; 9,533,115; 9,867,955; and 10,384,024. According to the complaint, the NYU patents are directed to systems and methods for diagnosis and treating sleeping disorders during different sleep states. The complaint seeks monetary damages and attorneys’ fees. We answered the complaint on September 30, 2021 and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the patents are invalid because the subject matter of the patents is not patentable under the Supreme Court and Federal Circuit precedent. The motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part. We have also requested that the court dismiss the case based on NYU’s license of the patents to Fisher & Paykel and Fisher & Paykel’s prior settlement with us. The matter is proceeding to discovery while the court considers our request. In December 2022, the Patent Trial and Appeals Board (“PTAB”) of the Patent and Trademark Office granted our request to review the validity of the claims in the patents asserted by NYU against us, determining that there is a reasonable likelihood that we will prevail. The PTAB’s final written decisions on the validity of the asserted claims is expected by December 2023.
On January 27, 2021, the International Trade Commission ("ITC") instituted In Re Certain UMTS and LTE Cellular Communications Modules and Products Containing the Same, Investigation No. 337-TA-1240, by complainants Philips RS North America, LLC and Koninklijke Philips N.V. (collectively “Philips”) against Quectel Wireless Solutions Co., Ltd; Thales DIS AIS USA, LLC, Thales DIS AIS Deutschland GmbH; Telit Wireless Solutions, Inc., Telit Communications PLC, CalAmp. Corp., Xirgo Technologies, LLC, and Laird Connectivity, Inc. (collectively “respondents”). In the ITC investigation, Philips seeks an order excluding communications modules, and products that contain them, from importation into the United States based on alleged infringement of 3G and 4G standard essential patents held by Philips. On October 6-14, 2021, the administrative law judge held a hearing on the merits. The administrative law judge issued an initial determination on April 1, 2022, finding no violation of any of the Philips' patents asserted in the ITC. Philips sought review by the full ITC. On July 6, 2022, the Commission affirmed the administrative law judge’s determination that there was no violation of asserted Philips' patents. The Commission terminated the ITC proceedings. Philips did not appeal the ITC’s decision. On December 17, 2020, Philips filed companion cases for patent infringement against the same defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, case nos. 1:20-cv-01707, 01708, 01709, 01710, 01711, and 01713 (CFC) seeking damages, an injunction, and a declaration from the court on the amount of a fair reasonable and non-discriminatory license rate for the standard essential patents it is asserting against the communications module defendants. The district court cases were stayed pending the resolution of the ITC proceedings.
The parties have returned to the district
18 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 1 RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) court for further proceedings. We are not a party to the ITC investigation or the district court cases, but we sell products that incorporate some of the communications modules at issue in the district court case.
On June 16, 2022, Cleveland Medical Devices Inc. ("Cleveland Medical") filed suit for patent infringement against ResMed Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, case no. 1:22-cv-00794. Cleveland Medical asserts that numerous ResMed connected devices, when combined with certain ResMed data platforms and/or software, including AirView and ResScan, infringe one or more of eight Cleveland Medical patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 10,076,269; 10,426,399; 10,925,535; 11,064,937; 10,028,698; 10,478,118; 11,202,603; and 11,234,637. We have moved to dismiss the action because Cleveland Medical sued the wrong ResMed entity. We have also moved to dismiss all claims based on U.S. Patent No. 10,076,269, as well as indirect and willful infringement allegations as to the remaining patents asserted against ResMed. Based on currently available information, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of loss or range of losses, if any, arising from matters that remain open. Contingent Obligations Under Recourse Provisions We use independent financing institutions to offer some of our customers financing for the purchase of some of our products. Under these arrangements, if the customer qualifies under the financing institutions’ credit criteria and finances the transaction, the customers repay the financing institution on a fixed payment plan. For some of these arrangements, the customer’s receivable balance is with limited recourse whereby we are responsible for repaying the financing company should the customer default. We record a contingent provision, which is estimated based on historical default rates. This is applied to receivables sold with recourse and is recorded in accrued expenses. During the six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, receivables sold with limited recourse were $ 84.3
million and $ 94.2
million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum exposure on outstanding receivables sold with recourse and contingent provision were $ 24.1
million and $ 1.0
million, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, the maximum exposure on outstanding receivables sold with recourse and contingent provision were $ 24.2
million and $ 2.1
million, respectively. (11)     Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We may use derivative financial instruments, specifically foreign cross-currency swaps, purchased foreign currency call options, collars and forward contracts to mitigate exposure from certain foreign currency risk. No derivatives are used for trading or speculative purposes. We do not require or are not required to pledge collateral for the derivative instruments. Fair Value and Net Investment Hedging On November 17, 2022, we executed foreign cross-currency swaps as net investment hedges and fair value hedges in designated hedging relationships with either the foreign denominated net asset balances or the foreign denominated intercompany loan as the hedged items. All derivatives are recorded at fair value as either an asset or liability. Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the hedged item. The purpose of the cross-currency swaps for the fair value hedge is to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign denominated intercompany debt between USD and EUR. For these hedges, we excluded certain components from the assessment of hedge effectiveness that are not related to spot rates. For fair value hedges that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in the same line item as the hedged item, other, net, in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in the statement of operations under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument and is presented in interest (expense) income, net. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and the amounts recognized in earnings is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.
The purpose of the cross-currency swaps for the net investment hedge is to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on the net asset balances of our foreign functional subsidiaries. For net investment hedges that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in cumulative translation adjustment within other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or
19 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 1 RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) substantially liquidated. The initial fair value of components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness will be recognized in interest (expense) income, net.
The notional value of outstanding foreign cross-currency swaps was $ 1,028.8
million at December 31, 2022. These contracts mature at various dates prior to December 31, 2029. Non-Designated Hedges We transact business in various foreign currencies, including a number of major European currencies as well as the Australian and Singapore dollars. We have foreign currency exposure through both our Australian and Singapore manufacturing activities, and international sales operations. We have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased foreign currency call options, collars and forward contracts to hedge foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities and manufacturing cash flows. The terms of such foreign currency hedging contracts generally do not exceed
three years . The purpose of this hedging program is to economically manage the financial impact of foreign currency exposures denominated mainly in Euros, and Australian and Singapore dollars. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated financial assets, liabilities, and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments. We do not designate these foreign currency contracts as hedges. All movements in the fair value of the foreign currency instruments are recorded within other, net in our condensed consolidated statements of income.
The notional value of the outstanding non-designated hedges was $ 976.2
million and $ 602.0
million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. These contracts mature at various dates prior to June 30, 2024. Fair Values of Derivative Instruments

We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counter parties to financial instruments. We minimize counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with major financial institutions and we do not expect material losses as a result of default by our counterparties.
(12)     Business Combinations On November 21, 2022, we completed our acquisition of
100 % of the shares in MediFox-Dan Investment GmbH and its subsidiaries (“MEDIFOX DAN”), a German leader in software solutions for a wide variety of out-of-hospital care providers, for $ 997.5
million. This acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination using purchase accounting and included in our condensed consolidated financial statements from November 21, 2022. The acquisition was paid for using funds drawn down from our Revolving Credit Agreement. 21 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 1 RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The total purchase price was allocated to MEDIFOX DAN's tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based upon preliminary estimated fair values as of the November 21, 2022 closing date, as follows (in thousands): Preliminary Intangible assets - useful life Cash $ 7,372   Accounts receivable 16,096   Property, plant and equipment 7,731   Equity method investment 57,298   Other assets 18,523   Accounts payable and accrued expenses ( 19,826 ) Deferred revenue ( 18,349 ) Other liabilities ( 11,623 ) Identifiable intangible assets: Developed technology 43,081   6

We do not believe that the completion of this work will materially modify the preliminary purchase price allocation. We expect to complete our purchase price allocation during the quarter ending June 30, 2023. The cost of the acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The goodwill recognized as part of the acquisition is reflected in our SaaS segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. It mainly represents the synergies that are unique to our combined businesses and the potential for new products and services to be developed in the future. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of this acquisition were not material to our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded acquisition related expenses of $ 8.4  million and $ 9.2  million, respectively, related to the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. We did
no t have material acquisition related expenses during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021. 22 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 2 RESMED INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The following is an overview of our results of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. Management’s discussion and analysis is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report. We are a global leader in the development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing of medical devices and cloud-based software applications that diagnose, treat and manage respiratory disorders, including sleep disordered breathing (“SDB”), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases. SDB includes obstructive sleep apnea and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep. Our products and solutions are designed to improve patient quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease and lower healthcare costs as global healthcare systems continue to drive a shift in care from hospitals to the home and lower cost settings. Our cloud-based software digital health applications, along with our devices, are designed to provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers.
Since the development of continuous positive airway pressure therapy, we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of products and solutions for a broader range of respiratory disorders including technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products, ventilation devices, diagnostic products, mask systems for use in the hospital and home, headgear and other accessories, dental devices, and cloud-based software informatics solutions to manage patient outcomes and customer and provider business processes. Our growth has been fueled by geographic expansion, our research and product development efforts, acquisitions and an increasing awareness of SDB and respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as significant health concerns.
We are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we invested $69.9 million on research and development activities, which represents 6.8% of net revenues, with a continued focus on the development and commercialization of new, innovative products and solutions that improve patient outcomes, create efficiencies for our customers and help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and lower healthcare costs. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 we continued the launch of AirSense 11, which introduces new features such as a touch screen, algorithms for patients new to therapy and digital enhancements and over-the-air update capabilities as well as continued to expand our global offering of devices to include Card-to-Cloud ("C2C") versions of our prior model AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 products that do not incorporate a communications module. We introduced these C2C models to address the growing backlog of patients waiting for therapy with our devices due to the global semiconductor supply shortage. Due to multiple acquisitions, including Brightree in April 2016, HEALTHCAREfirst in July 2018, MatrixCare in November 2018, and MEDIFOX DAN in November 2022, our operations now include out-of-hospital software platforms designed to support the professionals and caregivers who help people stay healthy in the home or care setting of their choice. These platforms comprise our SaaS business. These products, our cloud-based remote monitoring and therapy management system, and a robust product pipeline, should continue to provide us with a strong platform for future growth.
We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry (“Sleep and Respiratory Care”) and the supply of business management software as a service to out-of-hospital health providers (“SaaS”). Net revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $1,033.7 million, an increase of 16% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. Gross margin was 56.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 56.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Diluted earnings per share was $1.53 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.37 for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
At December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $253.2 million, our total assets were $6.7 billion and our stockholders’ equity was $3.7 billion.
In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a “constant currency” basis, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented. In order to calculate our constant currency information, we translate the current
24 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 2 RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period. However, constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Results of Operations Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Net Revenue

Movements in international currencies against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net revenue by approximately $35.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the impact of currency movements, total Sleep and Respiratory Care net revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased by 20% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in unit sales of our devices and masks. Net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business in the U.S., Canada and Latin America for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased to $615.3 million from $486.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $128.5 million or 26%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our devices, including incremental sales of the C2C devices, and masks. Net revenue in combined Europe, Asia and other markets decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2022 to $301.7 million from $309.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $7.3 million or 2% (an 8% increase on a constant currency basis). The constant currency increase in sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets predominantly reflects an increase in unit sales of our devices and masks.

Software as a Service Net revenue from our SaaS business for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was increased to $222.6 million from $196.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $26.1 million or 13%. The increase was predominantly due to our recent acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, which was acquired on November 21, 2022, in addition to continued growth in the HME vertical within our SaaS business. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit increased for the three months ended December 31, 2022 to $579.7 million from $504.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $75.4 million or 15%. Gross margin, which is gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was 56.1% compared to 56.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease in gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 was due primarily to unfavorable product mix, higher distribution and warehouse related costs, and unfavorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by increases in average selling prices and a decrease in the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Gross profit increased for the six months ended December 31, 2022 to $1,120.5 million from $1,010.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $109.9 million or 11%. Gross margin for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was 56.5% compared to 56.2% for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in gross margin for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021 was due primarily to favorable average selling prices and a decrease in the amortization of acquired intangible assets, partially offset by unfavorable product mix changes and higher distribution and warehouse related costs.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $10.3 million, as reported in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased by 20% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general, and administrative expenses were 20.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 20.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The constant currency increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs, increases in travel and entertainment expenses, and additional expenses associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased for the six months ended December 31, 2022 to $404.9 million from $362.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $42.8 million or 12%.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations our expenses by approximately $2.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as reported in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses increased by 15% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 6.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 7.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in research and development expenses in constant currency terms was primarily due to increased investment in our digital health technologies and SaaS solutions as well as additional expenses associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions.
Research and development expenses increased for the six months ended December 31, 2022 to $133.1 million from $122.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $10.6 million, or 9%.

The increase in research and development expenses in constant currency terms was primarily due to increased investment in our digital health technologies and SaaS solutions as well as additional expenses associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions. Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets
Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the three months ended December 31, 2022 totaled $9.6 million compared to $7.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in amortization expense was primarily attributable to our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN. Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the six months ended December 31, 2022 totaled $17.5 million compared to $15.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in amortization expense was primarily attributable to our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN. Total Other Income (Loss), Net The following table summarizes our other income (loss) (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Interest (expense) income, net $ (10,338) $ (5,948) $ (4,390) Loss attributable to equity method investments (2,826) (1,914) (912) Gain (loss) on equity investments 8,368  (4,404) 12,772  Other, net (1,707) 841  (2,548) Total other income (loss), net $ (6,503) $ (11,425) $ 4,922  Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Interest (expense) income, net (17,472) (11,308) $ (6,164) Loss attributable to equity method investments (4,853) (3,300) (1,553) Gain (loss) on equity investments 5,088  1,208  3,880  Other, net (3,211) (1,150) (2,061) Total other income (loss), net $ (20,448) $ (14,550) $ (5,898) Total other income (loss), net for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was a loss of $6.5 million compared to a loss of $11.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in loss was primarily due to gains associated with our investments in marketable and non-marketable equity securities, which were a gain of $8.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to a loss of $4.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The
29 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 2 RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations gain in investments
for the three months ended December 31, 2022 is primarily attributable to observable price adjustments on non-marketable equity securities. We recorded higher losses attributable to equity method investments for the three months ended December 31, 2022 of $2.8 million compared to $1.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, interest expense, net, increased to $10.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $5.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 due to higher debt levels associated with the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, which was funded by our Revolving Credit Agreement. Total other income (loss), net for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was a loss of $20.4 million compared to a loss of $14.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Interest expense, net, increased to $17.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $11.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021 due to higher debt levels associated with the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, which was funded by our Revolving Credit Agreement. In addition, we recorded higher losses attributable to equity method investments for the six months ended December 31, 2022 of $4.9 million compared to $3.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. These losses were partially offset by gains associated with our investments in marketable and non-marketable equity securities, which were a gain of $5.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to a gain of $1.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was 17.8% and 18.7% as compared to 15.0% and 18.3% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021. Our effective rate of 17.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 differs from the statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to research credits, foreign operations and windfall tax benefits related to the vesting or settlement of employee share-based awards. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to a reduction in the windfall tax benefits related to the vesting or settlement of employee share-based awards.
Our Singapore operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs that will expire in whole or in part at various dates through June 30, 2030. As a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable during the year ended June 30, 2018. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax, if repatriated. On September 19, 2021, we concluded the settlement agreement with the Australian Taxation Office (“ATO") in relation to the previously disclosed transfer pricing dispute for the tax years 2009 through 2018 (“ATO settlement”). The ATO settlement fully resolved the dispute for all prior years, with no admission of liability and provides clarity in relation to certain future taxation principles. On September 28, 2021, we remitted final payment to the ATO of $284.8 million, consisting of the agreed settlement amount of $381.7 million less prior remittances made to the ATO of $96.9 million. Net Income and Earnings per Share As a result of the factors above, our net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $224.9 million compared to $201.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $23.2 million, or 11%. Our net income for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $435.4 million compared to $405.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $30.0 million, or 7%. Our diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $1.53 per diluted share compared to $1.37 for the three months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 12%. Our diluted earnings per share for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $2.95 per diluted share compared to $2.76 for the six months ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 7%.
Summary of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP cost of sales, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, in evaluating the performance of our business. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with
30 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 2 RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GAAP financial measures, can provide investors better insight when evaluating our performance from core operations and can provide more consistent financial reporting across periods. For these reasons, we use non-GAAP information internally in planning, forecasting, and evaluating the results of operations in the current period and in comparing it to past periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The measure “non-GAAP cost of sales” is equal to GAAP cost of sales less amortization of acquired intangible assets relating to cost of sales. The measure “non-GAAP gross profit” is the difference between GAAP net revenue and non-GAAP cost of sales, and “non-GAAP gross margin” is the ratio of non-GAAP gross profit to GAAP net revenue.
These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below (in thousands, except percentages): Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 GAAP Net revenue $ 1,033,744  $ 894,874  $ 1,984,038  $ 1,798,890    GAAP Cost of sales $ 454,029  $ 390,556  $ 863,514  $ 788,282  Less:

Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and access to our revolving credit facility. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development activities, selling and marketing activities, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments, dividend payments and repayment of debt obligations. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of several factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, which include impacts from supply chain disruptions, working capital requirements and capital deployment decisions. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate in net revenue, third-party reimbursement of our products for our customers, the timing and extent of spending to support research development efforts, the expansion of selling, general and administrative activities, the timing of introductions of new products, and the expenditures associated with possible future acquisitions, investments or other business combination transactions. As we assess inorganic growth strategies, we may need to supplement our internally generated cash flow with outside sources. If we are required to access the debt market, we believe that we will be able to secure reasonable borrowing rates. As part of our liquidity strategy, we will continue to monitor our current level of earnings and cash flow generation as well as our ability to access the market considering those earning levels.
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $253.2 million and $273.7 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents held within the United States at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 were $72.6 million and $70.0 million, respectively. Our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, were $180.6 million and $203.7 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions . As of December 31, 2022, we had $390.0 million available for draw down under the revolver credit facility and a combined total of $643.2 million in cash and available liquidity under the revolving credit facility.
As a result of the U.S. Tax Act, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable, which resulted in additional tax expense of $126.9 million which was payable over the proceeding eight years. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax if repatriated.
We believe that our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations, including expected capital expenditures, for the next 12 months and beyond. Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes On June 29, 2022, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Revolving Credit Agreement”). The Revolving Credit Agreement, among other things, provided a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $1,500.0 million, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an
32 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 2 RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations additional amount equal to the greater of $1,000.0 million and 1.00 times the EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month measurement period. Additionally, on June 29, 2022, ResMed Pty Limited entered into a Second Amendment to the Syndicated Facility Agreement (the “Term Credit Agreement”). The Term Credit Agreement, among other things, provides ResMed Limited a senior unsecured term credit facility of $195.0 million. The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement each terminate on June 29, 2027, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. As of December 31, 2022, we had $390.0 million available for draw down under the revolving credit facility. On July 10, 2019, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with the purchasers to that agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale of $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.24% senior notes due July 10, 2026, and $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.45% senior notes due July 10, 2029 (“Senior Notes”).
On December 31, 2022, there was a total of $1,805.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes. We expect to satisfy all of our liquidity and long-term debt requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt facilities. Cash Flow Summary The following table summarizes our cash flow activity (in thousands):
Six Months Ended December 31,   2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 173,298  $ 154,222  Net cash used in investing activities (1,085,218) (125,182) Net cash (used in) / provided by financing activities 891,022  (125,004) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 387  (4,838) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (20,511) $ (100,802) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $173.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash provided of $154.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The $19.1 million increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to the payment of our tax settlement with the ATO of $284.8 million during the six months ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by greater purchases of inventory to secure adequate components for increasing sales demand and other net changes in working capital balances during the six months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021.
Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $1,085.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash used of $125.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The $960.0 million decrease in cash flow from investing activities was primarily due to cash used to acquire MEDIFOX DAN. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $891.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash used of $125.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The $1,016.0 million increase in cash flow from financing activities was primarily due to borrowing activity under our Revolving Credit Agreement in order to finance our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN.
Dividends During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we paid cash dividends of $0.44 per common share totaling $64.5 million. On January 26, 2023, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.44 per common share, to be paid on March 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 9, 2023. Future dividends are subject to approval by our board of directors. 33 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 2 RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Common Stock Since the inception of our share repurchase programs and through December 31, 2022, we have repurchased a total of 41.8 million shares for an aggregate of $1.6 billion. We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions and as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we did not repurchase any shares during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Shares that are repurchased are classified as treasury stock pending future use and reduce the number of shares of common stock outstanding used in calculating earnings (loss) per share. There is no expiration date for this program, and the program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time at the discretion of our board of directors. At December 31, 2022, 12.9 million additional shares can be repurchased under the approved share repurchase program. Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, warranty obligations, goodwill, potentially impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies. We state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. The estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a full discussion of our critical accounting policies, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022.
In addition to the critical accounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, due to recent transactions and events, we also consider the following to be part of our critical accounting policies and estimates due to the high degree of judgment and complexity in its application:
Business Combinations.
The MEDIFOX DAN acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, or acquisition accounting, in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. The acquisition method of accounting involved the allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This allocation process involves the use of estimates and assumptions made in connection with determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed including cash flows expected to be derived from the use of the asset, the timing of such cash flows, the remaining useful life of assets and applicable discount rates. Acquisition accounting allows up to one year to obtain the information necessary to finalize the fair value of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the November 21, 2022 acquisition date. As of January 26, 2023, we have recorded a preliminary allocation of consideration to net tangible and intangible assets acquired, which is subject to revision as we obtain additional information necessary to complete the fair value
studies
and acquisition accounting.
In the event that actual results vary from the estimates or assumptions used in the valuation or allocation process, we may be required to record an impairment charge or an increase in depreciation or amortization in future periods, or both. Refer to Note 12, Business Combinations, to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information about accounting for the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Market Risk Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, although the financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are maintained in their respective local currencies. We transact business in various foreign currencies, including a number of major European currencies as well as the Australian and Singapore dollars. We have significant foreign currency exposure through our Australian and Singapore manufacturing activities and our international sales operations.
Net Investment and Fair Value
Hedging On November 17, 2022, we executed foreign cross-currency swaps as net investment hedges and fair value hedges in designated hedging relationships with either the foreign denominated net asset balances or the foreign denominated intercompany loan as the hedged items. All derivatives are recorded at fair value as either an asset or liability. Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the hedged item. The purpose of the cross-currency swaps for the fair value hedge is to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign denominated intercompany debt between USD and EUR. For these hedges, we excluded certain components from the assessment of hedge effectiveness that are not related to spot rates. For fair value hedges that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in the same line item as the hedged item, Other, net, in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in the statement of operations under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument and is presented in interest (expense) income, net. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and the amounts recognized in earnings is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.
The purpose of the cross-currency swaps for the net investment hedge is to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on the net asset balances of our foreign functional subsidiaries. For net investment hedges that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in cumulative translation adjustment within other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. The initial fair value of components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness will be recognized in interest (expense) income, net.
The notional value of outstanding foreign cross-currency swaps was $1,028.8 million at December 31, 2022. These contracts mature at various dates prior to December 31, 2029. Non-Designated Hedges We transact business in various foreign currencies, including a number of major European currencies as well as the Australian and Singapore dollars. We have foreign currency exposure through both our Australian and Singapore manufacturing activities, and international sales operations. We have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased foreign currency call options, collars and forward contracts to hedge foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities and manufacturing cash flows. The terms of such foreign currency hedging contracts generally do not exceed three years. The purpose of this hedging program is to economically manage the financial impact of foreign currency exposures denominated mainly in Euros, and Australian and Singapore dollars. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated financial assets, liabilities, and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments. We do not designate these foreign currency contracts as hedges. All movements in the fair value of the foreign currency instruments are recorded within other, net in our condensed consolidated statements of income.
The notional value of the outstanding non-designated hedges was $976.2 million and $602.0 million at December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. These contracts mature at various dates prior to June 30, 2024. 36 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 3 RESMED INC.

At December 31, 2022, we held cash and cash equivalents of $253.2 million, principally comprised of bank term deposits and at-call accounts, and are invested at both short-term fixed interest rates and variable interest rates. At December 31, 2022, there was $1,305.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement, which are subject to variable interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during the three months ended December 31, 2022, would not have had a material impact on pretax income. We have no interest rate hedging agreements. Inflation Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our products, freight, overhead costs or wage rates may adversely affect our operating results. Sustained inflationary pressures in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue if we are unable to offset such higher costs through price increases. 38 Table of Contents PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 4 RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Item 4    Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports made pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022.
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 39 Table of Contents PART II – OTHER INFORMATION Item 1-6 RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1    Legal Proceedings We are involved in various legal proceedings, claims, investigations and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We investigate these matters as they arise, and accrue estimates for resolution of legal and other contingencies in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification Topic 450, “Contingencies”. See note 10 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Litigation is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these matters. But we do not expect the outcome of these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements when taken as a whole.
Item 1A    Risk Factors The discussion of our business and operations should be read together with the risk factors and contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, which was filed with the SEC and describe various material risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. As of December 31, 2022, there have been no further material changes to such risk factors. Item 2    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Purchases of equity securities.
On February 21, 2014, our board of directors approved our current share repurchase program, authorizing us to acquire up to an aggregate of 20.0 million shares of our common stock. The program allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time for cash in the open market, or in negotiated or block transactions, as market and business conditions warrant and subject to applicable legal requirements. There is no expiration date for this program, and the program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time at the discretion of our board of directors. All share repurchases after February 21, 2014 have been executed under this program. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions and as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we did not repurchase any shares during the three months ended December 31, 2022. However, there is no expiration date for this program, and we may, at any time, elect to resume the share repurchase program as the circumstances allow. Since the inception of the share buyback programs, we have repurchased 41.8 million shares at a total cost of $1.6 billion. At December 31, 2022, 12.9 million additional shares of common stock can be repurchased under the approved share repurchase program.
